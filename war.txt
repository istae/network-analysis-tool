tolstoy
18281910
count
leo
nikolayevich
tolstoy
was
born
august
28
1828
at
the
family
estate
of
yasna
ya
polyana
in
the
province
of
tula
.
his
moth
er
died
when
he
was
three
and
his
father
six
years
later
.
placed
in
the
care
of
his
aunts
he
passed
many
of
his
early
years
at
kazan
where
in
1844
after
a
preliminary
training
by
french
tutors
he
entered
the
university
.
he
cared
lit
tle
for
the
university
and
in
1847
withdrew
be
cause
of
illhealth
and
domestic
circum
stances
.
he
had
however
done
a
great
deal
of
reading
of
french
english
and
russian
novels
the
new
testament
voltaire
and
hegel
.
the
author
exercising
the
greatest
in
fluence
upon
him
at
this
time
was
rousseau
he
read
his
complete
works
and
for
sometime
wore
about
his
neck
a
medallion
of
rousseau
.
immediately
upon
leaving
the
university
tolstoy
returned
to
his
estate
and
perhaps
inr
spired
by
his
enthusiasm
for
rousseau
pre
pared
to
devote
himself
to
agriculture
and
to
improving
the
condition
of
his
serfs
.
his
first
attempt
at
social
reform
proved
disappointing
and
after
six
months
he
withdrew
to
moscow
and
st
.
petersburg
where
he
gave
himself
over
to
the
irregular
life
characteristic
of
his
class
and
time
.
in
1851
determined
to
escape
my
debts
and
more
than
anything
else
my
hab
its
he
enlisted
in
the
army
as
a
gentleman
volunteer
and
went
to
the
caucasus
.
while
at
tiflis
preparing
for
his
examinations
as
a
cadet
he
wrote
the
first
portion
of
the
trilogy
childhood
boyhood
and
youth
in
which
he
celebrated
the
happiness
of
being
with
na
ture
seeing
her
communing
with
her
.
he
al
so
began
the
cossacks
with
the
intention
of
showing
that
culture
is
the
enemy
of
happi
ness
.
although
continuing
his
army
life
he
gradually
came
to
realize
that
a
military
ca
reer
is
not
for
me
and
the
sooner
i
get
out
of
it
and
devote
myself
entirely
to
literature
the
better
.
his
sevastopol
sketches
1855
were
so
successful
that
czar
nicholas
issued
special
orders
that
he
should
be
removed
from
a
post
of
danger
.
returning
to
st
.
petersburg
tolstoy
was
re
ceived
with
great
favor
in
both
the
official
and
literary
circles
of
the
capital
.
he
soon
became
interested
in
the
popular
progressive
move
ment
of
the
time
and
in
1857
he
decided
to
go
abroad
and
study
the
educational
and
munici
pal
systems
of
other
countries
.
that
year
and
again
in
1860
he
traveled
in
europe
.
at
yas
naya
polyana
in
1861
he
liberated
his
serfs
and
opened
a
school
established
on
the
principle
that
everything
which
savours
of
compulsion
is
harmful
.
he
started
a
magazine
to
promote
his
notions
on
education
and
at
the
same
time
served
as
an
official
arbitrator
for
grievances
between
the
nobles
and
the
recently
emanci
pated
serfs
.
by
the
end
of
1863
he
was
so
ex
hausted
that
he
discontinued
his
activities
and
retired
to
the
steppes
to
drink
koumis
for
his
health
.
tolstoy
had
been
contemplating
marriage
for
some
time
and
in
1862
he
married
sophie
behrs
sixteen
years
his
junior
and
the
daugh
ter
of
a
fashionable
moscow
doctor
.
their
early
married
life
at
yasnaya
polyana
was
tranquil
.
family
cares
occupied
the
countess
and
in
the
course
of
her
life
she
bore
thirteen
children
nine
of
whom
survived
infancy
.
yet
she
also
acted
as
a
copyist
for
her
husband
who
after
their
marriage
turned
again
to
writ
ing
.
he
was
soon
at
work
upon
a
novel
of
the
i8ios
and
2os
which
absorbed
all
his
time
and
effort
.
he
went
frequently
to
mos
cow
studying
letters
diaries
and
traditions
and
accumulated
a
whole
library
of
histori
cal
material
on
the
period
.
he
interviewed
survivors
of
the
battles
of
that
time
and
trav
eled
to
borodino
to
draw
up
a
map
of
the
battleground
.
finally
in
1869
after
his
work
had
undergone
several
changes
in
conception
and
he
had
spent
five
years
of
uninterrupted
andjgxceptionally
strenuous
labor
tnnierthe
ibesfcondutions
of
life
he
published
war
and
peace
.
its
appearance
immediately
established
tolstoys
reputation
and
in
the
judgment
of
turgenev
the
acknowledged
dean
of
russian
letters
gave
him
first
place
among
all
our
contemporary
writers
.
the
years
immediately
following
the
com
pletion
of
war
and
peace
were
paefl
in
a
great
variety
of
occupations
none
of
which
tohtoy
found
satisfying
.
he
tried
busying
vi
biographical
note
himself
with
the
affairs
of
his
estate
under
took
the
learning
of
greek
to
read
the
ancient
classics
turned
again
to
education
wrote
a
series
of
elementary
school
books
and
served
as
school
inspector
.
with
much
urging
from
his
wife
and
friends
he
completed
anna
kare
nina
which
appeared
serially
between
1875
and
1877
.
disturbed
by
what
he
considered
his
unreflective
and
prosperous
existence
tolstoy
became
increasingly
interested
in
religion
.
at
first
he
turned
to
the
orthodox
faith
of
the
people
.
unable
to
find
rest
there
he
began
a
detailed
examination
of
religions
and
out
of
his
reading
particularly
of
the
gospels
gradu
ally
evolved
his
own
personal
doctrine
.
following
his
conversion
tolstoy
adopted
a
new
mode
of
life
.
he
dressed
like
a
peasant
devoted
much
of
his
time
to
manual
work
learned
shoemaking
and
followed
a
vegetari
an
diet
.
with
the
exception
of
his
youngest
daughter
alexandra
tolstoys
family
re
mained
hostile
to
his
teaching
.
the
breach
be
tween
him
and
his
wife
grew
steadily
wider
.
in
1879
he
wrote
the
kreutzer
sonata
in
which
he
attacked
the
normal
state
of
marriage
and
extolled
a
life
of
celibacy
and
chastity
.
in
1881
he
divided
his
estate
among
his
heirs
and
a
few
years
later
despite
the
opposition
of
his
wife
announced
that
he
would
forego
royal
ties
on
all
the
works
published
after
his
con
version
.
tolstoy
made
no
attempt
at
first
to
propa
gate
his
religious
teaching
although
it
attracted
many
followers
.
after
a
visit
to
the
moscow
slums
iri
1881
he
became
concerned
with
social
conditions
and
he
subsequently
aided
the
suf
ferers
of
the
famine
by
sponsoring
two
hun
dred
and
fifty
relief
kitchens
.
after
his
meet
ing
and
intimacy
with
chertkov
tolstoyism
began
to
develop
as
an
organized
sect
.
tol
stoys
writings
became
almost
exclusively
pre
occupied
with
religious
problems
.
in
addition
to
numerous
pamphlets
and
plays
he
wrote
iv
hat
is
art
1896
in
which
he
explained
his
new
aesthetic
theories
and
hadjimurad
1904
which
became
the
favorite
work
of
his
old
age
.
although
his
activities
were
looked
upon
with
increasing
suspicion
by
the
official
authorities
tolstoy
escaped
official
censure
until
1901
when
he
was
excommunicated
by
the
orthodox
church
.
his
followers
were
f
re
quently
subjected
to
persecution
and
many
were
either
banished
or
imprisoned
.
tolstoys
last
years
were
embittered
by
mounting
hostility
within
his
own
household
.
although
his
personal
life
was
ascetic
he
felt
the
ambiguity
of
his
position
as
a
preacher
of
poverty
living
on
his
great
estate
.
finally
at
the
age
of
eightytwo
with
the
aid
of
his
daugh
ter
alexandra
he
fled
from
home
.
his
health
broke
down
a
few
days
later
and
he
was
re
moved
from
the
train
to
the
stationmasters
hut
at
astopovo
where
he
died
november
7
1910
.
he
was
buried
at
yasnaya
polyana
in
the
first
public
funeral
to
be
held

i

prince
so

and
lucca
are

of
the
buonapartes
.
but
i
warn
you
if
you
dont
tell
me
that
this
means
war
if
you
still
try
to
defend
the
infamies
and
horrors
perpetrated
by
that
antichrist
i
real
ly
believe
he
is

i
will
have
nothing
more
to

with
you
and
you
are
no

my
friend
no

my
faithful
slave
as
you
call
yourself
but
how
do
you
do
i
see
i
have
frightened
you
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
the
news
.
it
was
in
july
1805
and
the
speaker
was
the
wellknown
anna
pdvlovna
schrer
maid
of
honor
and
favorite
of
the
empress
marya
fe
dorovna
.
with
these
words
she
greeted
prince
vasili
kurdgin
a
man
of
high
rank
and
impor
tance
who
was
the
first
to
arrive
at
her
recep
tion
.
anna
pdvlovna
had
had
a
cough
for
some
days
.
she
was
as
she
said
suffering
from

used

by

.
all
her
invitations
without
exception
writ
ten
in
french
and
delivered
by
a
scarletliver
ied
footman
that
morning
ran
as
follows
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
count
or
prince
and
if
the
prospect
of
spending
an
evening
with
a
poor
invalid
is
not
too
terrible
i
shall
be
very
charmed
to
see
you
tonight

annette
schrer
.
heavens
what
a
virulent
attack
replied
the
prince
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
by
this
reception
.
he
had
just
entered
wearing
an
em
broidered
court
uniform
knee
breeches
and
shoes
and
had
stars
on
his
breast
and
a
serene
expression
on
his
flat
face
.
he
spoke
in
that
refined
french
in
which
our
grandfathers
not
only
spoke
but
thought
and
with
the
gentle
patronizing
intonation
natural
to
a
man
of
importance
who
had
grown
old
in
society
and
at
court
.
he
went
up
to
anna
pavlovna
kissed
her
hand
presenting
to
her
his
bald
scented
and
shining
head
and
complacently
seated
himself
on
the
sofa
.
first
of
all
dear
friend
tell
me
how
you
are
.
set
your
friends
mind
at
rest
said
he
without
altering
his
tone
beneath
the
polite
ness
and
affected
sympathy
of
which
indiffer
ence
and
even
irony
could
be
discerned
.
can
one
be
well
while
suffering
morally
can
one
be
calm
in
tirrfes
like
these
if
one
has
any
feeling
said
anna
pdvlovna
.
you
are
staying

i
hope
and
the

ambassadors
today
is

said
the
prince
.
my
daughter
is
coming
for
me
to
take
me
there
.
i
thought
todays
fete
had
been
canceled
.
i
confess
all
these
festivities
and
fireworks
are
becoming
wearisome
.
if
they
had
known
that
you
wished
it
the
entertainment
would
have
been

off
said
the
prince
who
like
a
woundup
clock
by
force
of
habit
said
things
he
did
not
even
wish
to
be
believed
.

what
can
one
say
about
it
replied
the
prince
in
a
cold
listless
tone
.
what
has
been

they
have
decided
that
buonaparte
has
burnt
his
boats
and
i
believe
that
we
are
ready
to

prince
vastti
always
spoke
languidly
like
an
actor
repeating
a
stale
part
.
anna
pdvlovna
scherer
on
the
contrary
despite
her
forty
years
overflowed
with
animation
and
impulsiveness
.
to
be
an
enthusiast
had
become
her
social
vo
cation
and
sometimes
even
when
she
did
not
feel
like
it
she
became
enthusiastic
in
order
not
to
disappoint
the
expectations
of
those
who
knew
her
.
the
subdued
smile
which
though
it
did
not
suit
her
faded
features
al
ways
played
round
her
lips
expressed
as
in
a
spoiled
child
a
continual
consciousness
of
her
charming
defect
which
she
neither
wished
nor
could
nor
considered
it
necessary
to
correct
.
in
the
midst
of
a
conversation
on
political
matters
anna
pdvlovna
burst
out
oh
dont
speak
to
me
of
austria
.
perhaps
war
and
peace
i
dont
understand
things
but
austria
never
has
wished
and
does
not
wish
for
war
.
she
is
betraying
us
russia
alone
must
save
europe
.
our
gracious
sovereign
recognizes
his
high
vo
cation
and
will
be
true
to
it
.
that
is
the
one
thing
i
have
faith
in
our
good
and
wonder
ful
sovereign
has
to
perfonn
the
noblest
role
on
earth
and
he
is
so
virtuous
and
noble
that
god
will
not
forsake
him
.
he
will
fulfill
his
vocation
and
crush
the
hydra
of
revolution
which
has
become
more
terrible
than
ever
in
the
person
of
this
murderer
and
villain
we
alone
must
avenge
the
blood
of
the
just
one
.

i

eng
land
with
her
commercial
spirit
will
not
and
cannot
understand
the
emperor
alexanders
loftiness
of
soul
.
she
tias
refused
to
evacuate
malta
.
she
wanted
to
find
and
still
seeks
some
secret
motive
in
our
actions
.
what
answer
did
novosiltsev
get
none
.
the
english
have
not
understood
and
cannot
understand
the
self
abnegation
of
our
emperor
who
wants
noth
ing
for
himself
but
only
desires
the
good
of
mankind
.
and
what
have
they
promised
noth
ing
and
what
little
they
have
promised
they
will
not
perform
prussia
has
always
declared
that
buonaparte
is
invincible
and
that
all
europe
is
powerless
before
him
.

.

.

.
and
i
dont
believe
a
word
that
hardenburg
says
or
haugwitz
either
.
this
famous
prussian
neu
trality
is
just
a
trap
.
i
have
faith
only
in
god
and
the
lofty
destiny
of
our
adored
monarch
.
he
will
save
europe
she
suddenly
paused
smiling
at
her
own
impetuosity
.
i
think
said
the
prince
with
a
smile
that
if
you
had
been
sent
instead
of
our
dear
wintzingerode
you
would
have
captured
the
king
of
prussias
consent
by
assault

you
are
so
eloquent

a

of

le

who
is
connected
with

through

he
is
one
of
the
genuine

and
also
the
abbe

do
you
know
that
profound
thinker
he
has
been
re
ceived
by
the
emperor
.
had
you
heard
i
shall
be
delighted
to
meet
them
said
the
prince
.
but
tell
me
he
added
with
studied
carelessness
as
if
it
had
only
just
occurred
to
him
though
the
question
he
was
about
to
ask
was
the
chief
motive
of
his
visit
is
it
true
that
the
dowager
empress
wants
baron
funke
to
be
appointed
first
secretary
at
vienna
the
baron
by
all
accounts
is
a
poor
creature
.
prince
vasfli
wished
to
obtain
this
post
for
his
son
but
others
were
trying
through
the
dowager
empress
mdrya
fedorovna
to
secure
it
for
the
baron
.
anna
pdvlovna
almost
closed
her
eyes
to
in
dicate
that
neither
she
nor
anyone
else
had
a
right
to
criticize
what
the
empress
desired
or
was
pleased
with
.
baron
funke
has
been
recommended
to
the
dowager
empress
by
her
sister
was
all
she
said
in
a
dry
and
mournful
tone
.
as
she
named
the
empress
anna
pdvlovnas
face
suddenly
assumed
an
expression
of
pro
found
and
sincere
devotion
and
respect
min
gled
with
sadness
and
thisoccurred
every
time
she
mentioned
her
illustrious
patroness
.
she
added
that
her
majesty
had
deigned
to
show
baron
funke
beaucoup
destime
and
again
her
face
clouded
over
with
sadness
.
the
prince
was
silent
and
looked
indiffer
ent
.
but
with
the
womanly
and
courtierlike
quickness
and
tact
habitual
to
her
anna
pdv
lovna
wished
both
to
rebuke
him
for
daring
to
speak
as
he
had
done
of
a
man
recommended
to
the
empress
and
at
the
same
time
to
con
sole
him
so
she
said
now
about
your
family
.
do
you
know
that
since
your
daughter
came
out
everyone
has
been
enraptured
by
her
they
say
she
is
amaz
ingly
beautiful
.
the
prince
bowed
to
signify
his
respect
and
gratitude
.
i
often
think
she
continued
after
a
short
pause
drawing
nearer
to
the
prince
and
smil
ing
amiably
at
him
as
if
to
show
that
political
and
social
topics
were
ended
and
the
time
had
come
for
intimate
conversation
i
often
think
how
unfairly
sometimes
the
joys
of
life
are
dis
tributed
.
why
has
fate
given
you
two
such
splendid
children
i
dont
speak
of
anatole
your
youngest
.
i
dont
like
him
she
added
in
a
tone
admitting
of
no
rejoinder
and
raising
her
eyebrows
.
two
such
charming
children
.
and
really
you
appreciate
them
less
than
any
one
and
so
you
dont
deserve
to
have
them
.
and
she
smiled
her
ecstatic
smile
.
i
cant
help
it
said
the
prince
.
lavater
would
have
said
i
lack
the
bump
of
paternity
.
dont
joke
i
mean
to
have
a
serious
talk
with
you
.
do
you
know
i
am
dissatisfied
with
your
younger
son
between
ourselves
and
her
face
assumed
its
melancholy
expression
he
was
mentioned
at
her
majestys
and
you
were
pitied
.

.

.

.
the
prince
answered
nothing
but
she
book
one
looked
at
him
significantly
awaiting
a
reply
.
he
frowned
.
what
would
you
have
me
do
he
said
at
last
.
you
know
i
did
all
a
father
could
for
their
education
and
they
have
both
turned
out
fools
.
hippolyte
is
at
least
a
quiet
fool
but
anatole
is
an
active
one
.
that
is
the
only
dif
ference
between
them
.
he
said
this
smiling
in
a
way
more
natural
and
animated
than
usual
so
that
the
wrinkles
round
his
mouth
very
clearly
revealed
something
unexpectedly
coarse
and
unpleasant
.
and
why
are
children
born
to
such
men
as
you
if
you
were
not
a
father
there
would
be
nothing
i
could
reproach
you
with
said
anna
pdvlovna
looking
up
pensively
.
i
am
your
faithful
slave
and
to
you
alone
i
can
confess
that
my
children
are
the
bane
of
my
life
.
it
is
the
cross
i
have
to
bear
.
that
is
how
i
explain
it
to
myself
.
it
cant
be
helped
he
said
no
more
but
expressed
his
resigna
tion
to
cruel
fate
by
a
gesture
.
anna
pdvlovna
meditated
.
have
you
never
thought
of
marrying
your
prodigal
son
anatole
she
asked
.
they
say
old
maids
have
a
mania
for
matchmaking
and
though
i
dont
feel
that
weakness
in
myself
as
yet
i
know
a
little
person
who
is
very
unhappy
with
her
father
.
she
is
a
relation
of
yours
princess
mary
bolk6nskaya
.
prince
vasili
did
not
reply
though
with
the
quickness
of
memory
and
perception
befitting
a
man
of
the
world
he
indicated
by
a
move
ment
of
the
head
that
he
was
considering
this
information
.
do
you
know
he
said
at
last
evidently
unable
to
check
the
sad
current
of
his
thoughts
that
anatole
is
costing
me
forty
thousand
rubles
a
year
and
he
went
on
after
a
pause
what
will
it
be
in
five
years
if
he
goes
on
like
this
presently
he
added
thats
what
we
fathers
have
to
put
up
with
is
this
princess
of
yours
rich
her
father
is
very
rich
and
stingy
.
he
lives
in
the
country
.
he
is
the
wellknown
prince
bolk6nski
who
had
to
retire
from
the
army
un
der
the
late
emperor
and
was
nicknamed
the
king
of
prussia
.
he
is
very
clever
but
eccen
tric
and
a
bore
.
the
poor
girl
is
very
unhappy
.
she
has
a
brother
i
think
you
know
him
he
married
lise
meinen
lately
.
he
is
an
aidede
camp
of
kutiizovs
and
will
be
here
tonight
.
listen
dear
annette
said
the
prince
sud
denly
taking
anna
pdvlovnas
hand
and
for
some
reason
drawing
it
downwards
.

that
affair
for
me
and
i
shall
always
be
your
most
devoted

is
rich
and
of
good
family
and
thats
all
i
want
.
and
with
the
familiarity
and
easy
grace
peculiar
to
him
he
raised
the
maid
of
honors
hand
to
his
lips
kissed
it
and
swung
it
to
and
fro
as
he
lay
back
in
his
armchair
looking
in
another
direction

the
whole
evening

the
young
princess
bolk6nskaya
had
brought
some
work
in
a
goldembroidered
vel
vet
bag
.
her
pretty
little
upper
lip
on
which
a
delicate
dark
down
was
just
perceptible
was
too
short
for
her
teeth
but
it
lifted
all
the
more
sweetly
and
was
especially
charming
when
she
occasionally
drew
it
down
to
meet
the
lower
lip
.

is
always
the
case
with
a
thoroughly
at
tractive
woman
her
defectthe
shortness
of
her
upperlip
and
her
halfopen
mouth
seemed
to
be
her
own
special
and
peculiar
form
of
beauty
.
everyone
brightened
at
the
sight
of
this
pretty
young
woman
so
soon
to
become
a
mother
so
full
of
life
and
health
and
carry
ing
her
burden
so
lightly
.
old
men
and
dull
dispirited
young
ones
who
looked
at
her
after
being
in
her
company
and
talking
to
her
a
litttle
while
felt
as
if
they
too
were
becoming
like
her
full
of
life
and
health
.
all
who
talked
to
her
and
at
each
word
saw
her
bright
smile
and
the
constant
gleam
of
her
white
teeth
thought
that
they
were
in
a
specially
amiable
mood
that
day
.
the
little
princess
went
round
the
table
with
quick
short
swaying
steps
her
workbag
on
her
arm
and
gaily
spreading
out
her
dress
sat
down
on
a
sofa
near
the
silver
samovar
as
if
all
she
was
doing
was
a
pleasure
to
herself
and
to
all
around
her
.
i
have
brought
my
work
said
she
in
french
displaying
her
bag
and
addressing
all

added
turning
to
her

.
you
wrote
that
it
was
to
be
quite
a
small
reception
and
just
see
how
badly
i
am
dressed
.
and
she
spread
out
her
arms
to
show
her
shortwaisted
lacetrimmed
dainty
gray
dress
girdled
with
a
broad
ribbon
just
below
the
breast
.

replied
anna

.
you
know
said
the
princess
in
the
same
tone
of
voice
and
still
in
french
turning
to
a
general
my

is
deserting
me

tell

what
this
wretched
war
is
for
she
added
addressing
prince
vasfli
and
without
waiting
for
an
an
swer
she
turned
to
speak
to
his
daughter
the
beautiful
hlne
.
what
a
delightful
woman
this
little
prin
cess
isl
said
prince
vasili
to
anna
pdvlovna
.
one
of
the
next
arrivals
was
a
stout
heavily
built
young
man
with
closecropped
hair
spec
tacles
the
lightcolored
breeches
fashionable
at
that
time
a
very
high
ruffle
and
a
brown
dress
coat
.
this
stout
young
man
was
an
illegit
imate
sonof
count
bezukhov
a
wellknown
grandee
of
catherines
time
who
now
lay
dy
ing
in
moscow
.
the
young
man
had
not
yet
entered
either
the
military
or
civil
service
as
he
had
only
just
returned
from
abroad
where
he
had
been
educated
and
this
was
his
first
ap
pearance
in
society
.
anna
pdvlovna
greeted
him
with
the
nod
she
accorded
to
the
lowest
hierarchy
in
her
drawing
room
.
but
in
spite
of
this
lowestgrade
greeting
a
look
of
anxiety
and
fear
as
at
the
sight
of
something
too
large
and
unsuited
to
the
place
came
over
her
face
when
she
saw
pierre
enter
.
though
he
was
cer
tainly
rather
bigger
than
the
other
men
in
the
room
her
anxiety
could
only
have
reference
to
the
clever
though
shy
but
observant
and
natural
expression
which
distinguished
him
from
everyone
else
in
that
drawing
room
.
it
is
very
good
of
you
monsieur
pierre
to
come
and
visit
a
poor
invalid
said
anna
pdv
lovna
exchanging
an
alarmed
glance
with
her
aunt
as
she
conducted
him
to
her
.
pierre
murmured
something
unintelligible
and
continued
to
look
round
as
if
in
search
of
something
.
on
his
way
to
the
aunt
he
bowed
to
the
little
princess
with
a
pleased
smile
as
to
an
intimate
acquaintance
.
anna
pdvlovnas
alarm
was
justified
for
pierre
turned
away
from
the
aunt
without
wait
ing
to
hear
her
speech
about
her
majestys
health
.
anna
pdvlovna
in
dismay
detained
him
with
the
words
do
you
know
the
abbe
morio
he
is
a
most
interesting
man
.
yes
i
have
heard
of
his
scheme
for
perpet
ual
peace
and
it
is
very
interesting
but
hardly
feasible
.
you
think
so
rejoined
anna
pdvlovna
in
order
to
say
something
and
get
away
to
attend
to
her
duties
as
hostess
.
but
pierre
now
com
mitted
a
reverse
act
of
impoliteness
.
first
he
had
left
a
lady
before
she
had
finished
speak
ing
to
him
and
now
he
continued
to
speak
to
another
who
wished
to
getaway
.
with
his
head
bent
and
his
big
feet
spread
apart
he
began
explaining
his
reasons
for
thinking
the
abbess
plan
chimerical
.
we
will
talk
of
it
later
said
anna
pdv
lovna
with
a
smile
.
and
having
got
rid
of
this
young
man
who
did
not
know
how
to
behave
she
resumed
her
duties
as
hostess
and
continued
to
listen
and
watch
ready
to
help
at
any
point
where
the
conversation
might
happen
to
flag
.
as
the
fore
man
of
a
spinning
mill
when
he
has
set
the
hands
to
work
goes
round
and
notices
here
a
book
one
spindle
that
has
stopped
or
there
one
that
creaks
or
makes
more
noise
than
it
should
and
hastens
to
check
the
machine
or
set
it
in
proper
motion
so
anna
pavlovna
moved
about
her
drawing
room
approaching
now
a
silent
now
a
toonoisy
group
and
by
a
word
or
slight
re
arrangement
kept
the
conversational
machine
in
steady
proper
and
regular
motion
.
but
amid
these
cares
her
anxiety
about
pierre
was
evident
.
she
kept
an
anxious
watch
on
him
when
he
approached
the
group
round
morte
mart
to
listen
to
what
was
being
said
there
and
again
when
he
passed
to
another
group
whose
center
was
the
abbe
.
pierre
had
been
educated
abroad
and
this
reception
at
anna
pavlovnas
was
the
first
he
had
attended
in
russia
.
he
knew
that
all
the
intellectual
lights
of
petersburg
were
gathered
there
and
like
a
child
in
a
toyshop
did
not
know
which
way
to
look
afraid
of
missing
any
clever
conversation
that
was
to
be
heard
.
see
ing
the
selfconfident
and
refined
expression
on
the
faces
of
those
present
he
was
always
ex
pecting
to
hear
something
very
profound
.
at
last
he
came
up
to
morio
.
here
the
conversa
tion
seemed
interesting
and
he
stood
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
express
his
own
views
as
young
people
are
fond
of
doing
.
chapter
iii
anna
pavlovnas
reception
was
in
full
swing
.
the
spindles
hummed
steadily
and
ceaselessly
on
all
sides
.
with
the
exception
of
the
aunt
beside
whom
sat
only
one
elderly
lady
who
with
her
thin
careworn
face
was
rather
out
of
place
in
this
brilliant
society
the
whole
com
pany
had
settled
into
three
groups
.
one
chiefly
masculine
had
formed
round
the
abbe
.
an
other
of
young
people
was
grouped
round
the
beautiful
princess
hlne
prince
vasflis
daughter
and
the
little
princess
bolk6nskaya
very
pretty
and
rosy
though
rather
too
plump
for
her
age
.
the
third
group
was
gathered
round
mortemart
and
anna
pavlovna
.
the
vicomte
was
a
nicelooking
young
man
with
soft
features
and
polished
manners
who
evidently
considered
himself
a
celebrity
but
out
of
politeness
modestly
placed
himself
at
the
disposal
of
the
circle
in
which
he
found
himself
.
anna
pdvlovna
was
obviously
serving
him
up
as
a
treat
to
her
guests
.
as
a
clever
maitre
dhotel
serves
up
as
a
specially
choice
delicacy
a
piece
of
meat
that
no
one
who
had
seen
it
in
the
kitchen
would
have
cared
to
eat
so
anna
pavlovna
served
up
to
her
guests
first
the
vicomte
and
then
the
abbe
as
peculiarly
choice
morsels
.
the
group
about
mortemart
immediately
began
discussing
the
murder
of
the
due
denghien
.
the
vicomte
said
that
the
due
denghien
had
perished
by
his
own
magna
nimity
and
that
there
were
particular
reasons
for
buonapartes
hatred
of
him
.
ah
yes
do
tell
us
all
about
it
vicomte
said
anna
pdvlovna
with
a
pleasant
feeling
that
there
was
something
a
la
louis
xv
in
the
sound
of
that
sentence
contez
nous
gela
vicomte
.
the
vicomte
bowed
and
smiled
courteously
in
token
of
his
willingness
to
comply
.
anna
pavlovna
arranged
a
group
round
him
invit
ing
everyone
to
listen
to
his
tale
.
the
vicomte
knew
the
due
personally
whispered
anna
pdvlovna
to
one
of
the
guests
.
the
vicomte
is
a
wonderful
raconteur
said
she
to
another
.
how
evidently
he
belongs
to
the
best
society
said
she
to
a
third
and
the
vicomte
was
served
up
to
the
company
in
the
choicest
and
most
advantageous
style
like
a
wellgarnished
joint
of
roast
beef
on
a
hot
dish
.
the
vicomte
wished
to
begin
his
story
and
gave
a
subtle
smile
.
come
over
here
hlne
dear
said
anna
pvlovna
to
the
beautiful
young
princess
who
was
sitting
some
way
off
the
center
of
another
group
.
the
princess
smiled
.
she
rose
with
the
same
unchanging
smile
with
which
she
had
first
en
tered
the
room
the
smile
of
a
perfectly
beauti
ful
woman
.
with
a
slight
rustle
of
her
white
dress
trimmed
with
moss
and
ivy
with
a
gleam
of
white
shoulders
glossy
hair
and
sparkling
diamonds
she
passed
between
the
men
who
made
way
for
her
not
looking
at
any
of
them
but
smiling
on
all
as
if
graciously
allowing
each
the
privilege
of
admiring
her
beautiful
figure
and
shapely
shoulders
back
and
bosom
which
in
the
fashion
of
those
days
were
very
much
exposed
and
she
seemed
to
bring
the
glamour
of
a
ballroom
with
her
as
she
moved
toward
anna
pavlovna
.
hlene
was
so
lovely
that
not
only
did
she
not
show
any
trace
of
coquetry
but
on
the
contrary
she
even
appeared
shy
of
her
unquestionable
and
all
too
victori
ous
beauty
.
she
seemed
to
wish
but
to
be
un
able
to
diminish
its
effect
.
how
lovely
said
everyone
who
saw
her
and
the
vicomte
lifted
his
shoulders
and
dropped
his
eyes
as
if
startled
by
something
ex
traordinary
when
she
took
her
seat
opposite
and
beamed
upon
him
also
with
her
unchanging
smile
.
6
war
and
peace
madame
i
doubt
my
ability
before
such
an
audience
said
he
smilingly
inclining
his
head
.
the
princess
rested
her
bare
round
arm
on
a
little
table
and
considered
a
reply
unneces
sary
.
she
smilingly
waited
.
all
the
time
the
story
was
being
told
she
sat
upright
glancing
now
at
her
beautiful
round
arm
altered
in
shape
by
its
pressure
on
the
table
now
at
her
still
more
beautiful
bosom
on
which
she
read
justed
a
diamond
necklace
.
from
time
to
time
she
smoothed
the
folds
of
her
dress
and
when
ever
the
story
produced
an
effect
she
glanced
at
anna
pavlovna
at
once
adopted
just
the
expression
she
saw
on
the
maid
of
honors
face
and
again
relapsed
into
her
radiant
smile
.
the
little
princess
had
also
left
the
tea
table
and
followed
helne
.
wait
a
moment
ill
get
my
work
.

.

.

.
now
then
what
are
you
thinking
of
she
went
on
turning
to
prince
hippolyte
.
fetch
me
my
workbag
.
there
was
a
general
movement
as
the
prin
cess
smiling
and
talking
merrily
to
everyone
at
once
sat
down
and
gaily
arranged
herself
in
her
seat
.
now
i
am
all
right
she
said
and
asking
the
vicomte
to
begin
she
took
up
her
work
.
prince
hippolyte
having
brought
the
work
bag
joined
the
circle
and
moving
a
chair
close
to
hers
seated
himself
beside
her
.
le
charmant
hippolyte
was
surprising
by
his
extraordinary
resemblance
to
his
beautiful
sister
but
yet
more
by
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
this
resemblance
he
was
exceedingly
ugly
.
his
features
were
like
his
sisters
but
while
in
her
case
everything
was
lit
up
by
a
joyous
self
satisfied
youthful
and
constant
smile
of
ani
mation
and
by
the
wonderful
classic
beauty
of
her
figure
his
face
on
the
contrary
was
dulled
by
imbecility
and
a
constant
expression
of
sullen
selfconfidence
while
his
body
was
thin
and
weak
.
his
eyes
nose
and
mouth
all
seemed
puckered
into
a
vacant
wearied
gri
mace
and
his
arms
and
legs
always
fell
into
unnatural
positions
.
its
not
going
to
be
a
ghost
story
said
he
sitting
down
beside
the
princess
and
hastily
adjusting
his
lorgnette
as
if
without
this
in
strument
he
could
not
begin
to
speak
.
why
no
my
dear
fellow
said
the
aston
ished
narrator
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
because
i
hate
ghost
stones
said
prince
hippolyte
in
a
tone
which
showed
that
he
only
understood
die
meaning
of
his
words
after
he
had
uttered
them
.
he
spoke
with
such
selfconfidence
that
his
hearers
ould
not
be
sure
whether
what
he
said
was
very
witty
or
very
stupid
.
he
was
dressed
in
a
darkgreen
dress
coat
knee
breeches
of
the
color
of
cuisse
de
nymphe
effrayje
as
he
called
it
shoes
and
silk
stockings
.
the
vicomte
told
his
tale
very
neatly
.
it
was
an
anecdote
then
current
to
the
effect
that
the
due
denghien
had
gone
secretly
to
paris
to
visit
mademoiselle
george
thatat
her
house
he
came
upon
bonaparte
who
also
enjoyed
the
famous
actress
favors
and
that
in
his
pres
ence
napoleon
happened
to
fall
into
one
of
the
fainting
fits
to
which
he
was
subject
and
was
thus
at
the
dues
mercy
.
the
latter
spared
him
and
this
magnanimity
bonaparte
subse
quently
repaid
by
death
.
the
story
was
very
pretty
and
interesting
especially
at
the
point
where
the
rivals
sud
denly
recognized
one
another
and
the
ladies
looked
agitated
.
charming
said
anna
pavlovna
with
an
in
quiring
glance
at
the
little
princess
.
charming
whispered
the
little
princess
sticking
the
needle
into
her
work
as
if
to
testify
that
the
interest
and
fascination
of
the
story
prevented
her
from
going
on
with
it
.
the
vicomte
appreciated
this
silent
praise
and
smiling
gratefully
prepared
to
continue
but
just
then
anna
pavlovna
who
had
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
the
young
man
who
so
alarmed
her
noticed
that
he
was
talking
too
loudly
and
vehemently
with
the
abbe
so
she
hurried
to
the
rescue
.
pierre
had
managed
to
start
a
conversation
with
the
abb
about
the
balance
of
power
and
the
latter
evidently
interested
by
the
young
mans
simpleminded
eagerness
was
explaining
his
pet
theory
.
both
were
talk
ing
and
listening
too
eagerly
and
too
naturally
which
was
why
anna
pavlovna
disapproved
.
the
means
are

.

.
the
balance
of
power
in
europe
and
the
rights
of
the
people
the
abbe
was
saying
.
it
is
only
necessary
for
one
power
ful
nation
like
russia
barbaric
as
she
is
said
to
be
to
place
herself
disinterestedly
at
the
head
of
an
alliance
having
for
its
object
the
mai
n
tenance
of
the
balance
of
power
of
europe
and
it
would
save
the
world
but
how
are
you
to
get
that
balance
pierre
was
beginning
.
at
that
moment
anna
pdvlovna
came
up
and
looking
severely
at
pierre
asked
the
italian
how
he
stood
the
russian
climate
.
the
italians
face
instantly
changed
and
assumed
an
offen
sively
affected
sugary
expression
evidently
habitual
to
him
when
conversing
with
women
.

he
.
not
letting
the

escape

the
more
conveniently
to
keep
them
under
observation
brought
them
into

larger
circle
.
chapter
iv
just
then
another
visitor
entered
the
drawing
room
prince
andrew
bolk6nski
the
little
princess
husband
.
he
was
a
very
handsome
young
man
of
medium
height
with
firm
clear
cut
features
.
everything
about
him
from
his
weary
bored
expression
to
his
quiet
measured
step
offered
a
most
striking
contrast
to
his
lively
little
wife
.
it
was
evident
that
he
not
only
knew
everyone
in
the
drawing
room
but
had
found
them
to
be
so
tiresome
that
it
wearied
him
to
look
at
or
listen
to
them
.
and
among
all
these
faces
that
he
found
so
tedious
none
seemed
to
bore
him
so
much
as
that
of
his
pretty
wife
.
he
turned
away
from
her
with
a
grimace
that
distorted
his
handsome
face
kissed
anna
pdvlovnas
hand
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
scanned
the
whole
company
.

his
wife
addressing
her

in
the
same
coquettish
manner
in
which
she
spoke
to
other
men

vicomte

been
telling
us
such
a
tale
about

andrew
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
turned
away
.
pierre
who
from
the
moment
prince
andrew
entered
the
room
had
watched
him
with
glad
affectionate
eyes
now
came
up
and
took
his
arm
.
before
he
looked
round
prince
andrew
frowned
again
expressing
his
annoyance
with
whoever
was
touching
his
arm
but
when
he
saw
pierres
beaming
face
he
gave
him
an
unexpectedly
kind
and
pleasant
smile
.

to

said
prince
andrew
laughing
and
pressing
pierres
hand
to
show
that
there
was
no
need
to
ask
the
question
.
he
wished
to
say
something
more
but
at
that
mo
ment
prince
vastti
and
his
daughter
got
up
to
go
and
the
two
young
men
rose
to
let

pass

you
must
excuse
me
dear
vicomte
said
prince
vasili
to
the
frenchman
holding
him
down
by
the
sleeve
in
a
friendly
way
to
prevent
his
rising
.
this
unfortunate
fete
at
the
ambas
sadors
deprives
me
of
a
pleasure
and
obliges
me
to
interrupt
you
.
i
am
very
sorry
to
leave
your
enchanting
party
said
he
turning
to
anna
pdvlovna
.
his
daughter
princess
helene
passed
be
tween
the
chairs
lightly
holding
up
the
folds
of
her
dress
and
the
smile
shone
still
more
radiantly
on
her
beautiful
face
.
pierre
gazed
at
her
with
rapturous
almost
frightened
eyes
as
she
passed
him
.
very
lovely
said
prince
andrew
.

said
pierre
.
in
passing
prince
vasili
seized
pierres
hand
and
said
to
anna
pdvlovna

for
me
he
has
been
staying
with
me
a
whole
month
and
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
seen
him
in
society
.
nothing
is
so
necessary
for
a
young
man
as
the
society
of
clever
women
.
anna
pavlovna
smiled
and
promised
to
take
pierre
in
hand
.
she
knew
his
father
to
be
a
connection
of
prince
vasilis
.
the
elderly
lady
who
had
been
sitting
with
the
old
aunt
rose
hurriedly
and
overtook
prince
vasfli
in
the
anteroom
.
all
the
affectation
of
interest
she
had
assumed
had
left
her
kindly
and
tear
worn
face
and
it
now
expressed
only
anxiety
and
fear
.
how
about
my
son
borfs
prince
said
she
hurrying
after
him
into
the
anteroom
.
1
cant
remain
any
longer
in
petersburg
.
tell
me
what
news
i
may
take
back
to
my
poor
boy
.
although
prince
vasili
listened
reluctantly
and
not
very
politely
to
the
elderly
lady
even
betraying
some
impatience
she
gave
him
an
ingratiating
and
appealing
smile
and
took
his
hand
that
he
might
not
go
away
.
what
would
it
cost
you
to
say
a
word
to
the
emperor
and
then
he
would
be
transferred
to
the
guards
at
once
said
she
.
believe
me
princess
i
am
ready
to
do
all
i
can
answered
prince
vasili
but
it
is
dif
8
war
and
peace
ficult
for
me
to
ask
the
emperor
.
i
should
ad
vise
you
to
appeal
to
rumydntsev
through
prince
golftsyn
.
that
would
be
the
best
way
.
the
elderly
lady
was
a
princess
drubet
skdya
belonging
to
one
of
the
best
families
in
russia
but
she
was
poor
and
having
long
been
out
of
society
had
lost
her
former
influential
connections
.
she
had
now
come
to
petersburg
to
procure
an
appointment
in
the
guards
for
her
only
son
.
it
was
in
fact
solely
to
meet
prince
vasfli
that
she
had
obtained
an
invita
tion
to
anna
pdvlovnas
reception
and
had
sat
listening
to
the
vicomtes
story
.
prince
vasflis
words
frightened
her
an
embittered
look
clouded
her
once
handsome
face
but
only
for
a
moment
then
she
smiled
again
and
clutched
prince
vasilis
arm
more
tightly
.
listen
to
me
prince
said
she
.
i
have
never
yet
asked
you
for
anything
and
i
never
will
again
nor
have
i
ever
reminded
you
of
my
fathers
friendship
for
you
but
now
i
en
treat
you
for
gods
sake
to
do
this
for
my
son
and
i
shall
always
regard
you
as
a
benefac
tor

added
hurriedly
.
no
dont
be
angry
but

i
have
asked

and
he
has
refused
.
be
the
kindhearted
man
you
always
were
she
said
trying
to
smile
though
tears
were
in
her
eyes
.
papa
we
shall
be
late
said
princess
helne
turning
her
beautiful
head
and
look
ing
over
her
classically
molded
shoulder
as
she
stood
waiting
by
the
door
.
influence
in
society
however
is
capital
which
has
to
be
economized
if
it
is
to
last
.
prince
vasfli
knew
this
and
having
once
realized
that
if
he
asked
on
behalf
of
all
who
begged
of
him
he
would
soon
be
unable
to
ask
for
himself
he
became
chary
of
using
his
influ
ence
.
but
in
princess
drubetskdyas
case
he
felt
after
her
second
appeal
something
like
qualms
of
conscience
.
she
had
reminded
him
of
what
was
quite
true
he
had
been
indebted
to
her
father
for
the
first
steps
in
his
career
.
more
over
he
could
see
by
her
manners
that
she
was
one
of
those
womenmostly
mothers
who
having
once
made
up
their
minds
will
not
rest
until
they
have
gained
their
end
and
are
pre
pared
if
necessary
to
go
on
insisting
day
after
day
and
hour
after
hour
and
even
to
make
scenes
.
this
last
consideration
moved
him
.
my
dear
anna
mikhdylovna
said
he
with
his
usual
familiarity
and
weariness
of
tone
it
is
almost
impossible
for
me
to
do
what
you
ask
but
to
prove
my
devotion
to
you
and

his

vasfli
cried
anna
mikhdylovna
as
he
went
with
the
smile
of
a
coquettish
girl
which
at
one
time
prob
ably
came
naturally
to
her
but
was
now
very
illsuited
to
her
careworn
face
.
apparently
she
had
forgotten
her
age
and
by
force
of
habit
employed
all
the
old
fem
inine
arts
.
but
as
soon
as
the
prince
had
gone
her
face
resumed
its
former
cold
artificial
ex
pression
.
she
returned
to
the
group
where
the
vicomte
was
still
talking
and
again
pretended
to
listen
while
waiting
till
it
would
be
time
to
leave
.
her
task
was
accomplished
.

and
sighing
disdainfully
he
again
changed
his
position
.
prince
hippolyte
who
had
been
gazing
at
the
vicomte
for
some
time
through
his
lor
gnette
suddenly
turned
completely
round
to
ward
the
little
princess
and
having
asked
for
a
needle
began
tracing
the
conde
coat
of
arms
on
the
table
.
he
explained
this
to
her
with
as
much
gravity
as
if
she
had
asked
him
to
do
it

he
.
the
princess
listened
smiling
.
if
buonaparte
remains
on
the
throne
of
france
a
year
longer
the
vicomte
continued
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
in
a
matter
with
which
he
is
better
acquainted
than
anyone
else
does
not
listen
to
others
but
follows
the
cur

of
his

he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
out
his
hands
.
jpierre
wished
to
make
a
remark
for
the
conversation
interested
him
but
anna
pdvlovna
who
had
him
under
observation
in
terrupted
the
emperor
alexander
said
she
with
the
melancholy
which
always
accompanied
any
reference
of
hers
to
the
imperial
family
has
declared
that
he
will
leave
it
to
the
french
people
themselves
to
choose
their
own
form
of
government
and
i
believe
that
once
free
from
the
usurper
the
whole
nation
will
cer
tainly
throw
itself
into
the
arms
of
its
rightful
king
she
concluded
trying
to
be
amiable
to
the
royalist
emigrant
.

.
that
is
doubtful
said
prince
andrew
.
monsieur
le
vicomte
quite
rightly
supposes
that
matters
have
already
gone
too
far
.
i
think
it
will
be
difficult
to
return
to
the
old
regime
.
one
9
from
what
i
have
heard
said
pierre
blushing
and
breaking
into
the
conversation
almost
all
the
aristocracy
has
already
gone
over
to
bonapartes
side
.
it
is
the
buonapartists
who
say
that
re
plied
the
vicomte
without
looking
at
pierre
.
at
the
present
time
it
is
difficult
to
know
the
real
state
of
french
public
opinion
.
bonaparte
has
said
so
remarked
prince
andrew
with
a
sarcastic
smile
.
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
like
the
vi
comte
and
was
aiming
his
remarks
at
him
though
without
looking
at
him
.

i
showed
them
the
path
to
glory
but
they
did
not
follow
it

prince
andrew
continued
after
a
short
silence
again
quoting
napoleons
words
.

i
opened
my
antechambers
and
they
crowded
in
.
i
do
not
know
how
far
he
was
justified
in
saying
so
.
not
in
the
least
replied
the
vicomte
.
aft
er
the
murder
of
the
due
even
the
most
par
tial
ceased
to
regard
him
as
a
hero
.
if
to
some
people
he
went
on
turning
to
anna
pav
lovna
he
ever
was
a
hero
after
the
murder
of
the
due
there
was
one
martyr
more
in
heav
en
and
one
hero
less
on
earth
.
before
anna
pdvlovna
and
the
others
had
time
to
smile
their
appreciation
of
the
vi
comtes
epigram
pierre
again
broke
into
the
conversation
and
though
anna
pdvlovna
felt
sure
he
would
say
something
inappropriate
she
was
unable
to
stop
him
.
the
execution
of
the
due
denghien
de
clared
monsieur
pierre
was
a
political
neces
sity
and
it
seems
to
me
that
napoleon
showed
greatness
of
soul
by
not
fearing
to
take
on
him
self
the
whole
responsibility
of
that
deed
.
dieu
mon
dieu
muttered
anna
pav

in
a
terrified
whisper
.
what
monsieur

do

of

the
little
princess
smiling
and
drawing
her
work
nearer
to
her

oh
oh
exclaimed
several
voices
.
capital
said
prince
hippolyte
in
eng
lish
and
began
slapping
his
knee
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
.
the
vicomte
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
pierre
looked
solemnly
at
his
audience
over
his
spectacles
and
continued
.
i
say
so
he
continued
desperately
be
cause
the
bourbons
fled
from
the
revolution
leaving
the
people
to
anarchy
and
napoleon
alone
understood
the
revolution
and
quelled
it
and
so
for
the
general
good
he
could
not
stop
short
for
the
sake
of
one
mans
life
.
1o
wont
you
come
over
to
the
other
table
suggested
anna
pvlovna
but
pierre
continued
his
speech
without
heeding
her
.
no
cried
he
becoming
more
and
more
eager
napoleon
is
great
because
he
rose
su
perior
to
the
revolution
suppressed
its
a
buses
preserved
all
that
was
good
in
itequal
ity
of
citizenship
and
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
press
and
only
for
that
reason
did
he
obtain
power
.
yes
if
having
obtained
power
without
a
vailing
himself
of
it
to
commit
murder
he
had
restored
it
to
the
rightful
king
i
should
have
called
him
a
great
man
remarked
the
vi
comte
.
he
could
not
do
that
.
the
people
only
gave
him
power
that
he
might
rid
them
of
the
bourbons
and
because
they
saw
that
he
was
a
great
man
.
the
revolution
was
a
grand
thing
continued
monsieur
pierre
betraying
by
this
desperate
and
provocative
proposition
his
ex
treme
youth
and
his
wish
to
express
all
that
was
in
his
mind
.
what
revolution
and
regicide
a
grand
thing

.

.

.
well
after
that

.

.

.
but
wont
you
come
to
this
other
table
repeated
anna
pdv
lovna
.
rousseaus
contrat
social
said
the
vi
comte
with
a
tolerant
smile
.
i
am
not
speaking
of
regicide
i
am
speak
ing
about
ideas
.
yes
ideas
of
robbery
murder
and
regi
cide
again
interjected
an
ironical
voice
.
those
were
extremes
no
doubt
but
they
are
not
what
is
most
important
.
what
is
im
portant
are
the
rights
of
man
emancipation
from
prejudices
and
equality
of
citizenship
and
all
these
ideas
napoleon
has
retained
in
full
force
.
liberty
and
equality
said
the
vicomte
contemptuously
as
if
at
last
deciding
seriously
to
prove
to
this
youth
how
foolish
his
words
were
highsounding
words
which
have
long
been
discredited
.
who
does
not
love
liberty
and
equality
even
our
saviour
preached
lib
erty
and
equality
.
have
people
since
the
rev
olution
become
happier
on
the
contrary
.
we
wanted
liberty
but
buonaparte
has
destroyed
it
.
prince
andrew
kept
looking
with
an
a
mused
smile
from
pierre
to
the
vicomte
and
from
the
vicomte
to
their
hostess
.
in
the
first
moment
of
pierres
outburst
anna
pdvlovna
despite
her
social
experience
was
horror
struck
.
but
when
she
saw
that
pierres
sacri
war
and
peace
legious
words
had
not
exasperated
the
vi
comte
ahd
had
convinced
herself
that
it
was
impossible
to
stop
him
she
rallied
her
forces
and
joined
the
vicomte
in
a
vigorous
attack
on
the
orator
.
but
my
dear
monsieur
pierre
said
she
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
of
a
great
man
executing
a
due
or
even
an
ordinary
man
who
is
innocent
and
untried
i
should
like
said
the
vicomte
to
ask
how
monsieur
explains
the
isthbrumaire
was
not
that
an
imposture
it
was
a
swindle
and
not
at
all
like
the
conduct
of
a
great
man
and
the
prisoners
he
killed
in
africathat
was
horrible
said
the
little
princess
shrug
ging
her
shoulders
.
hes
a
low
fellow
say
what
you
will
re
marked
prince
hippolyte
.
pierre
not
knowing
whom
to
answer
looked
at
them
all
and
smiled
.
his
smile
was
unlike
the
halfsmile
of
other
people
.
when
he
smiled
his
grave
even
rather
gloomy
look
was
instan
taneously
replaced
by
another
a
childlike
kindly
even
rather
silly
look
which
seemed
to
ask
forgiveness
.
the
vicomte
who
was
meeting
him
for
the
first
time
saw
clearly
that
this
young
jacobin
was
not
so
terrible
as
his
words
suggested
.
all
were
silent
.
how
do
you
expect
him
to
answer
you
all
at
once
said
prince
andrew
.
besides
in
the
actions
of
a
statesman
one
has
to
distinguish
between
his
acts
as
a
private
person
as
a
gen
eral
and
as
an
emperor
.
so
it
seems
to
me
.
yes
yes
of
course
pierre
chimed
in
pleased
at
the
arrival
of
this
reinforcement
.
one
must
admit
continued
prince
an
drew
that
napoleon
as
a
man
was
great
on
the
bridge
of
arcola
and
in
the
hospital
at
jaffa
where
he
gave
his
hand
to
the
plague
stricken
but

.

.

.
but
there
are
other
acts
which
it
is
difficult
to
justify
.
prince
andrew
who
had
evidently
wished
to
tone
down
the
awkwardness
of
pierres
re
marks
rose
and
made
a
sign
to
his
wife
that
it
was
time
to
go
.
suddenly
prince
hippolyte
started
up
mak
ing
signs
to
everyone
to
attend
and
asking
them
all
to
be
seated
began
i
was
told
a
charming
moscow
story
today
and
must
treat
you
to
it
.
excuse
me
vicomte
i
must
tell
it
in
russian
or
the
point
will
be
lost
.

.

.

.
and
prince
hippolyte
began
to
tell
his
story
in
sucli
russian
as
a
frenchman
would
speak
after
spending
about
a
year
in
book
one
russia
.
everyone
waited
so
emphatically
and
eagerly
did
he
demand
their
attention
to
his
story
.
there
is
in
moscow
a
lady
une
dame
and
she
is
very
stingy
.
she
must
have
two
footmen
behind
her
carriage
and
very
big
ones
.
that
was
her
taste
.
and
she
had
a
ladys
maid
also
big
.
she
said

.

.

.
here
prince
hippolyte
paused
evidently
collecting
his
ideas
with
difficulty
.
she
said

..
.
oh
yes
she
said
girl
to
the
maid
put
on
a
livery
get
up
behind
the
car
riage
and
come
with
me
while
i
make
some
calls

here
prince
hippolyte
spluttered
andburst
out
laughing
long
before
his
audience
which
produced
an
effect
unfavorable
to
the
narra
tor
.
several
persons
among
them
the
elderly
lady
and
anna
pavlovna
did
however
smile
.
she
went
.
suddenly
there
was
a
great
wind
.
the
girl
lost
her
hat
and
her
long
hair
came
down
.

.

.

.
here
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
and
went
on
between
gasps
of
laugh
ter
and
the
whole
world
knew
.

.

.

.
and
so
the
anecdote
ended
.
though
it
was
unintelligible
why
he
had
told
it
or
why
it
had
to
be
told
in
russian
still
anna
pdvlovna
and
the
others
appreciated
prince
hippolytes
social
tact
in
so
agreeably
ending
pierres
un
pleasant
and
unamiable
outburst
.
after
the
anecdote
the
conversation
broke
up
into
in
significant
small
talk
about
the
last
and
next
balls
about
theatricals
and
who
would
meet
whom
and
when
and
where
.
chapter
vi
having
thanked
anna
pavlovna
for
her
charming
soiree
the
guests
began
to
take
their
leave
.
pierre
was
ungainly
.
stout
about
the
aver
age
height
broad
with
huge
red
hands
he
did
not
know
as
the
saying
is
how
to
enter
a
draw
ing
room
and
still
less
how
to
leave
one
that
is
how
to
say
something
particularly
agreeable
before
going
away
.
besides
this
he
was
absent
minded
.
when
he
rose
to
go
he
took
up
in
stead
of
his
own
the
generals
threecornered
hat
and
held
it
pulling
at
the
plume
till
the
general
asked
him
to
restore
it
.
all
his
absent
mindedness
and
inability
to
enter
a
room
and
converse
in
it
was
however
redeemed
by
his
kindly
simple
and
modest
expression
.
anna
pdvlovna
turned
toward
him
and
with
a
christian
mildness
that
expressed
forgiveness
of
his
indiscretion
nodded
and
said
i
hope
to
see
you
again
but
i
also
hope
you
will
change
your
opinions
my
dear
monsieur
pierre
.
when
she
said
this
he
did
not
reply
and
only
bowed
but
again
everybody
saw
his
smile
which
said
nothing
unless
perhaps
opinions
are
opinions
but
you
see
what
a
capital
good
natured
fellow
i
am
.
and
everyone
includ
ing
anna
pavlovna
felt
this
.
prince
andrew
had
gone
out
into
the
hall
and
turning
his
shoulders
to
the
footman
who
was
helping
him
on
with
his
cloak
listened
in
differently
to
his
wifes
chatter
with
prince
hippolyte
who
had
also
come
into
the
hall
.
prince
hippolyte
stood
close
to
the
pretty
pregnant
princess
and
stared
fixedly
at
hei
through
his
eyeglass
.
go
in
annette
or
you
will
catch
cold
said
the
little
princess
taking
leave
of
anna
pavlovna
.
it
is
settled
she
added
in
a
low
voice
.
anna
pavlovna
had
already
managed
to
speak
to
lise
about
the
match
she
contem
plated
between
anatole
and
the
little
princess
sisterinlaw
.
i
rely
on
you
my
dear
said
anna
pdv
lovna
also
in
a
low
tone
.
write
to
her
and
let
me
know
how
her
father
looks
at
the
mat
ter
.
an
revoirznd
she
left
the
hall
.
prince
hippolyte
approached
the
little
prin
cess
and
bending
his
face
close
to
her
began
to
whisper
something
.
two
footmen
the
princess
and
his
own
stood
holding
a
shawl
and
a
cloak
waiting
for
the
conversation
to
finish
.
they
listened
to
the
french
sentences
which
to
them
were
meaningless
with
an
air
of
understanding
but
not
wishing
to
appear
to
do
so
.
the
princess
as
usual
spoke
smilingly
and
listened
with
a
laugh
.
i
am
very
glad
i
did
not
go
to
the
ambas
sadors
said
prince
hippolyte
so
dull
.
it
has
been
a
delightful
evening
has
it
not
delightful
they
say
die
ball
will
be
very
good
re
plied
the
princess
drawing
up
her
downy
lit
tle
lip
.
all
the
pretty
women
in
society
will
be
there
.
not
all
for
you
will
not
be
there
not
all
said
prince
hippolyte
smiling
joyfully
and
snatching
the
shawl
from
the
footman
whom
he
even
pushed
aside
he
began
wrapping
it
round
the
princess
.
either
from
awkwardness
or
intentionally
no
one
could
have
said
which
after
the
shawl
had
been
adjusted
he
kept
his
arm
around
her
for
a
long
time
as
though
embracing
her
.
still
smiling
she
gracefully
moved
away
is
turning
and
glancing
at
her
husband
.
prince
andrews
eyes
were
closed
so
weary
and
sleepy
did
he
seem
.
are
you
ready
he
asked
his
wife
look
ing
past
her
.
prince
hippolyte
hurriedly
put
on
his
cloak
which
in
the
latest
fashion
reached
to
his
very
heels
and
stumbling
in
it
ran
out
into
the
porch
following
the
princess
whom
a
footman
was
helping
into
the
carriage
.
princesse
au
revoir
cried
he
stumbling
with
his
tongue
as
well
as
with
his
feet
.
the
princess
picking
up
her
dress
was
tak
ing
her
seat
in
the
dark
carriage
her
husband
was
adjusting
his
saber
prince
hippolyte
un
der
pretense
of
helping
was
in
everyones
way
.
allow
me
sir
said
prince
andrew
in
rus
sian
in
a
cold
disagreeable
tone
to
prince
hippolyte
who
was
blocking
his
path
.
i
am
expecting
you
pierre
said
the
same
voice
but
gently
and
affectionately
.
the
postilion
started
the
carriage
wheels
rattled
.
prince
hippolyte
laughed
spasmod
ically
as
he
stood
in
the
porch
waiting
for
the
vicomte
whom
he
had
promised
to
take
home
.
well
mon
cher
said
the
vicomte
having
seated
himself
beside
hippolyte
in
the
car
riage
your
little
princess
is
very
nice
very
nice
indeed
quite
french
and
he
kissed
the
tips
of
his
fingers
.
hippolyte
burst
out
laugh
ing
.
do
you
know
you
are
a
terrible
chap
for
all
your
innocent
airs
continued
the
vicomte
.
i
pity
the
poor
husband
that
little
officer
who
gives
himself
the
airs
of
a
monarch
.
hippolyte
spluttered
again
and
amid
his
laughter
said
and
you
were
saying
that
the
russian
ladies
are
not
equal
to
the
french
one
has
to
know
how
to
deal
with
them
.
pierre
reaching
the
house
first
went
into
prince
andrews
study
like
one
quite
at
home
and
from
habit
immediately
lay
down
on
the
sofa
took
from
the
shelf
the
first
book
that
came
to
his
hand
it
was
caesars
commen
taries
and
resting
on
his
elbow
began
read
ing
it
in
the
middle
.
what
have
you
done
to
mile
schrer
she
will
be
quite
ill
now
said
prince
andrew
as
he
entered
the
study
rubbing
his
small
white
hands
.
pierre
turned
his
whole
body
making
the
sofa
creak
.
he
lifted
his
eager
face
to
prince
andrew
smiled
and
waved
his
hand
.
that
abbl
is
very
interesting
but
he
does
war
and
peace
not
see
the
thing
in
the
right
light
.

..
.
in
my
opinion
perpetual
peace
is
possible
but
i
do
not
know
how
to
express
it

..
.
not
by
a
bal
ance
of
political
power
.

.

.

.
it
was
evident
that
prince
andrew
was
not
interested
in
such
abstract
conversation
.
one
cant
everywhere
say
all
one
thinks
mon
cher
.
well
have
you
at
last
decided
on
anything
are
you
going
to
be
a
guardsman
or
a
diplomatist
asked
prince
andrew
after
a
momentary
silence
.
pierre
sat
up
on
the
sofa
with
his
legs
tucked
under
him
.
really
i
dont
yet
know
.
i
dont
like
either
the
one
or
the
other
.
but
you
must
decide
on
somethingl
your
father
expects
it
.
pierre
at
the
age
of
ten
had
been
sent
a
broad
with
an
abb
as
tutor
and
had
remained
away
till
he
was
twenty
.
when
he
returned
to
moscow
his
father
dismissed
the
abbe
and
said
to
the
young
man
now
go
to
petersburg
look
round
and
choose
your
profession
.
i
will
agree
to
anything
.
here
is
a
letter
to
prince
vasili
and
here
is
money
.
write
to
me
all
about
it
and
i
will
help
you
in
everything
.
pierre
had
already
been
choosing
a
career
for
three
months
and
had
not
decided
on
any
thing
.
it
was
about
this
choice
that
prince
andrew
was
speaking
.
pierre
rubbed
his
fore
head
.
but
he
must
be
a
freemason
said
he
re
ferring
to
the
abb
whom
he
had
met
that
evening
.

that
is
all
nonsense
.
prince
andrew
again
interrupted
him
let
us
talk
business
.
have
you
been
to
the
horse
guards
no
i
have
not
but
this
is
what
i
have
been
thinking
and
wanted
to
tell
you
.
there
is
a
war
now
against
napoleon
.
if
it
were
a
war
for
freedom
i
could
understand
it
and
should
be
the
first
to
enter
the
army
but
to
help
england
and
austria
against
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
is
not
right
.
prince
andrew
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
pierres
childish
words
.
he
put
on
the
air
of
one
who
finds
it
impossible
to
reply
to
such
nonsense
but
it
would
in
fact
have
been
difficult
to
give
any
other
answer
than
the
one
prince
andrew
gave
to
this
naive
question
.
if
no
one
fought
except
on
his
own
con
viction
there
would
be
no
wars
he
said
.
and
that
would
be
splendid
said
pierre
.
prince
andrew
smiled
ironically
.
very
likely
it
would
be
splendid
but
it
will
never
come
about
.

book

well
why
are
you
going
to
the

asked
pierre
.

what
for
i
dont
know
.
i
must
.
besides
that
i
am
going

.
he
paused
.
i
am
going
because
the
life
i
am
leading
here
does
not
suit
mel
chapter
vii
the
rustle
of
a
womans
dress
was
heard
in
the
next
room
.
prince
andrew
shook
himself
as
if
waking
up
and
his
face
assumed
the
look
it
had
had
in
anna
pdvlovnas
drawing
room
.
pierre
removed
his
feet
from
the
sofa
.
the
princess
came
in
.
she
had
changed
her
gown
for
a
house
dress
as
fresh
and
elegant
as
the
other
.
prince
andrew
rose
and
politely
placed
a
chair
for
her
.
how
is
it
she
began
as
usual
in
french
settling
down
briskly
and
fussily
in
the
easy
chair
how
is
it
annette
never
got
married
how
stupid
you
men
all
are
not
to
have
mar
ried
her
excuse
me
for
saying
so
but
you
have
no
sense
about
women
.
what
an
argu
mentative
fellow
you
are
monsieur
pierre
and
i
am
still
arguing
with
your
husband
.
i
cant
understand
why
he
wants
to
go
to
the
war
replied
pierre
addressing
the
princess
with
none
of
the
embarrassment
so
commonly
shown
by
young
men
in
their
intercourse
with
young
women
.
the
princess
started
.
evidently
pierres
words
touched
her
to
the
quick
.
ah
that
is
just
what
i
tell
himl
said
she
.
i
dont
understand
it
i
dont
in
the
least
un
derstand
why
men
cant
live
without
wars
.
how
is
it
that
we
women
dont
want
anything
of
the
kind
dont
need
it
now
you
shall
judge
between
us
.
i
always
tell
him
here
he
is
uncles
aidedecamp
a
most
brilliant
posi
tion
.
he
is
so
well
known
so
much
appreciated
by
everyone
.
the
other
day
at
the
aprksins
i
heard
a
lady
asking
is
that
the
famous
prince
andrew
i
did
indeed
.
she
laughed
.
he
is
so
well
received
everywhere
.
he
might
easily
become
aidedecamp
to
the
emperor
.
you
know
the
emperor
spoke
to
him
most
gra
ciously
.
annette
and
i
were
speaking
of
how
to
arrange
it
.
what
do
you
think
pierre
looked
at
his
friend
and
noticing
that
he
did
not
like
the
conversation
gave
no
reply
.
when
are
you
starting
he
asked
.
oh
dont
speak
of
his
going
dont
i
wont
hear
it
spoken
of
said
the
princess
in
the
same
petulantly
playful
tone
in
which
she
had
spoken
to
hippolyte
in
the
drawing
room
and
which
was
so
plainly
illsuited
to
the
family
circle
of
which
pierre
was
almost
a
member
.
today
when
i
remembered
that
all
these
de
lightful
associations
must
be
broken
off

..
.
and
then
you
know
andr

.

.

.
she
looked
significantly
at
her
husband
im
afraid
im
afraid
she
whispered
and
a
shudder
ran
down
her
back
.
her
husband
looked
at
her
as
if
surprised
to
notice
that
someone
besides
pierre
and
him
self
was
in
the
room
and
addressed
her
in
a
tone
of
frigid
politeness
.
what
is
it
you
are
afraid
of
lise
i
dont
understand
said
he
.
there
what
egotists
men
all
are
all
all
egotists
just
for
a
whim
of
his
own
goodness
only
knows
why
he
leaves
me
and
locks
me
up
alone
in
the
country
.
with
my
father
and
sister
remember
said
prince
andrew
gently
.
alone
all
the
same
without
my
friends
.

.

.

.
and
he
expects
me
not
to
be
afraid
.
her
tone
was
now
querulous
and
her
lip
drawn
up
giving
her
not
a
joyful
but
an
ani
mal
squirrellike
expression
.
she
paused
as
if
she
felt
it
indecorous
to
speak
of
her
preg
nancy
before
pierre
though
the
gist
of
the
matter
lay
in
that
.
i
still
cant
understand
what
you
are
afraid
of
said
prince
andrew
slowly
not
taking
his
eyes
off
his
wife
.
the
princess
blushed
and
raised
her
arms
with
a
gesture
of
despair
.
no
andrew
i
must
say
you
have
changed
.
oh
how
you
have

.

.

.
your
doctor
tells
you
to
go
to
bed
earlier
said
prince
andrew
.
you
had
better
go
.
the
princess
said
nothing
but
suddenly
her
short
downy
lip
quivered
.
prince
andrew
rose
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
about
the
room
.
pierre
looked
over
his
spectacles
with
naive
surprise
now
at
him
and
now
at
her
moved
as
if
about
to
rise
too
but
changed
his
mind
.
why
should
i
mind
monsieur
pierre
being
here
exclaimed
the
little
princess
suddenly
her
pretty
face
all
at
once
distorted
by
a
tear
ful
grimace
.
i
have
long
wanted
to
ask
you
andrew
why
you
have
changed
so
to
me
what
have
i
done
to
you
you
are
going
to
the
war
and
have
no
pity
for
me
.
why
is
it
lise
was
all
prince
andrew
said
.
but
that
one
word
expressed
an
entreaty
a
threat
and
above
all
conviction
that
she
would
herself
re
gret
her
words
.
but
she
went
on
hurriedly
you
treat
me
like
an
invalid
or
a
child
.
i
war
and
peace
see
it
all
did
you
behave
like
that
six
months
ago
lise
i
beg
you
to
desist
said
prince
an
drew
still
more
emphatically
.
pierre
who
had
been
growing
more
and
more
agitated
as
he
listened
to
all
this
rose
and
approached
the
princess
.
he
seemed
un
able
to
bear
the
sight
of
tears
and
was
ready
to
cry
himself
.
calm
yourself
princess
it
seems
so
to
you
because

..
.
i
assure
you
i
myself
have
experi
enced

.

.

.
and
so

..
.
because

.

.

.
no
excuse

an
outsider
is
out
of
place
here

.

.

.
no
dont
distress
yourself

.

.

.
goodby
prince
andrew
caught
him
by
the
hand
.
no
wait
pierre
the
princess
is
too
kind
to
wish
to
deprive
me
of
the
pleasure
of
spend
ing
the
evening
with
you
.
no
he
thinks
only
of
himself
muttered
the
princess
without
restraining
her
angry
tears
.
lise
said
prince
andrew
dryly
raising
his
voice
to
the
pitch
which
indicates
that
pa
tience
is
exhausted
.
suddenly
the
angry
squirrellike
expression
of
the
princess
pretty
face
changed
into
a
win
ning
and
piteous
look
of
fear
.
her
beautiful
eyes
glanced
askance
at
her
husbands
face
and
her
own
assumed
the
timid
deprecating
expression
of
a
dog
when
it
rapidly
but
feebly
wags
its
drooping
tail
.
m
on

rnon

she
muttered
and
lifting
her
dress
with
one
hand
she
went
up
to
her
husband
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
.
good
night
lise
said
he
rising
and
cour
teously
kissing
her
hand
as
he
would
have
done
to
a
stranger
.
chapter

the
friends
were
silent
.
neither
cared
to
be
gin
talking
.
pierre
continually
glanced
at
prince
andrew
prince
andrew
rubbed
his
forehead
with
his
small
hand
.
let
us
go
and
have
supper
he
said
with
a
sigh
going
to
the
door
.
they
entered
the
elegant
newly
decorated
and
luxurious
dining
room
.
everything
from
the
table
napkins
to
the
silver
china
and
glass
bore
that
imprint
of
newness
found
in
the
households
of
the
newly
married
.
halfway
through
supper
prince
andrew
leaned
his
el
bows
on
the
table
and
with
a
look
of
nervous
agitation
such
as
pierre
had
never
before
seen
on
his
face
began
to
talk
as
one
who
has
long
had
something
on
his
mind
and
suddenly
de
termines
to
speak
out
.
never
never
marry
my
dear
fellow
thats
my
advice
never
marry
till
you
can
say
to
yoursel
f
that
you
have
done
all
you
are
capa
ble
of
and
until
you
have
ceased
to
love
the
woman
of
your
choice
and
have
seen
her
plain
ly
as
she
is
or
else
you
will
make
a
cruel
and
irrevocable
mistake
.
marry
when
you
are
old
and
good
for
nothing
or
all
that
is
good
and
noble
in
you
will
be
lost
.
it
will
all
be
wasted
on
trifles
.
yes
yes
yes
dont
look
at
me
with
such
surprise
.
if
you
marry
expecting
anything
from
yourself
in
the
future
you
will
feel
at
every
step
that
for
you
all
is
ended
all
is
closed
except
the
drawing
room
where
you
will
be
ranged
side
by
side
with
a
court
lackey
and
an
idiot

.

.

.
but
whats
the
good

.

.

.
and
he
waved
his
arm
.
pierre
took
off
his
spectacles
which
made
his
face
seem
different
and
the
goodnatured
expression
still
more
apparent
and
gazed
at
his
friend
in
amazement
.
my
wife
continued
prince
andrew
is
an
excellent
woman
one
of
those
rare
women
with
whom
a
mans
honor
is
safe
but
o
god
what
would
i
not
give
now
to
be
unmarried
you
are
the
first
and
only
one
to
whom
i
men
tion
this
because
i
like
you
.
as
he
said
this
prince
andrew
was
less
than
ever
like
that
bolk6nski
who
had
lolled
in
anna
pavlovnas
easy
chairs
and
with
half
closed
eyes
had
uttered
french
phrases
be
tween
his
teeth
.
every
muscle
of
his
thin
face
was
now
quivering
with
nervous
excitement
his
eyes
in
which
the
fire
of
life
had
seemed
extinguished
now
flashed
with
brilliant
light
.
it
was
evident
that
the
more
lifeless
he
seemed
at
ordinary
times
the
more
impassioned
he
be
came
in
these
moments
of
almost
morbid
irri
tation
.
you
dont
understand
why
i
say
this
he
continued
but
it
is
the
whole
story
of
life
.
you
talk
of
bonaparte
and
his
career
said
he
though
pierre
had
not
mentioned
bona
parte
but
bonaparte
when
he
worked
went
step
by
step
toward
his
goal
.
he
was
free
he
had
nothing
but
his
aim
to
consider
and
he
reached
it
.
but
tie
yourself
up
with
a
woman
and
like
a
chained
convict
you
lose
all
free
dom
and
all
you
have
of
hope
and
strength
merely
weighs
you
down
and
torments
you
with
regret
.
drawing
rooms
gossip
balls
van
ity
and
triviality
these
are
the
enchanted
circle
i
cannot
escape
from
.
i
am
now
going
to
the
war
the
greatest
war
there
ever
was
and
i
know
nothing
and
am
fit
for
nothing
.
i
am
very
amiable
and
have
a
caustic
wit
continued
prince
andrew
and
at
anna
pdv
book
one
lovnas
they
listen
to
me
.
and
that
stupid
set
without
whom
my
wife
cannot
exist
an4
those
women

..
.
if
you
only
knew
what
those
society
women
are
and
women
in
general
i
my
father
is
right
.
selfish
vain
stupid
trivial
in
every
thingthats
what
women
are
when
you
see
them
in
their
true
colors
when
you
meet
them
in
society
it
seems
as
if
there
were
something
in
them
but
theres
nothing
nothing
noth
ing
no
dont
marry
my
dear
fellow
dont
marry
concluded
prince
andrew
.
it
seems
funny
to
me
said
pierre
that
you
you
should
consider
yourself
incapable
and
your
life
a
spoiled
life
.
you
have
every
thing
before
you
everything
.
and
you

.

.

.
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
but
his
tone
showed
how
highly
he
thought
of
his
friend
and
how
much
he
expected
of
him
in
the
fu
ture
.
how
can
he
talk
like
that
thought
pierre
.
he
considered
his
friend
a
model
of
perfec
tion
because
prince
andrew
possessed
in
the
highest
degree
just
the
very
qualities
pierre
lacked
and
which
might
be
best
described
as
strength
of
will
.
pierre
was
always
astonished
at
prince
andrews
calm
manner
of
treating
everybody
his
extraordinary
memory
his
ex
tensive
reading
he
had
read
everything
knew
everything
and
had
an
opinion
about
every
thing
but
above
all
at
his
capacity
for
work
and
study
.
and
if
pierre
was
often
struck
by
andrews
lack
of
capacity
for
philosophical
meditation
to
which
he
himself
was
particu
larly
addicted
he
regarded
even
this
not
as
a
defect
but
as
a
sign
of
strength
.
even
in
the
best
most
friendly
and
sim
plest
relations
of
life
praise
and
commenda
tion
are
essential
just
as
grease
is
necessary
to
wheels
that
they
may
run
smoothly
.
my
part
is
played
out
said
prince
an
drew
.
whats
the
use
of
talking
about
me
let
us
talk
about
you
he
added
after
a
si
lence
smiling
at
his
reassuring
thoughts
.
that
smile
was
immediately
reflected
on
pierres
face
.
but
what
is
there
to
say
about
me
said
pierre
his
face
relaxing
into
a
careless
merry
smile
.
what
am
i
an
illegitimate
son
he
suddenly
blushed
crimson
and
it
was
plain
that
he
had
made
a
great
effort
to
say
this
.
with
out
a
name
and
without
means

.

.

.
and
it
really

.


.
but
he
did
not
say
what
it
really
was
.
for
the
present
i
am
free
and
am
all
right
.
only
i
havent
the
least
idea
what
i
am
to
do
i
wanted
to
consult
you
seriously
.
prince
andrew
looked
kindly
at
him
yet
his
glance
friendly
and
affectionate
as
it
was
expressed
a
sense
of
his
own
superiority
.
i
am
fond
of
you
especially
as
you
are
the
one
live
man
among
our
whole
set
.
yes
youre
all
right
choose
what
you
will
its
all
the
same

youll
be
all
right

but
look
here
give
up
visiting
those
kurdgins
and
lead

that
sort
of
life

it
suits
you
so
badly
all
this
debauchery
dissipation
and
the
rest
of
it
what
would
you
have
my

pierre
shrugging
his

staying
at

the

the

do

pierre

a
happy
thought

i
have
long
been
thinking

he
asked
me
for
tonight

wont
go

you
give
me
your
word
of
honor
not
to
go
on
my

chapter
ix
1
r
was
past
one
oclock
when
pierre
left
his
friend
.
it
was
a
cloudless
northern
summer
night
.
pierre
took
an
open
cab
intending
to
drive
straight
home
.
but
the
nearer
he
drew
to
the
house
the
more
he
felt
the
impossibility
of
going
to
sleep
on
such
a
night
.
it
was
light
enough
to
see
a
long
way
in
the
deserted
street
and
it
seemed
more
like
morning
or
evening
than
night
.
on
the
way
pierre
remembered
that
anatole
kuragin
was
expecting
the
usual
set
for
cards
that
evening
after
which
there
was
generally
a
drinking
bout
finishing
with
visits
of
a
kind
pierre
was
very
fond
of
.
i
should
like
to
go
to
kuragins
thought
he
.
but
he
immediately
recalled
his
promise
to
prince
andrew
not
to
go
there
.
then
as
hap
pens
to
people
of
weak
character
he
desired
so
passionately
once
more
to
enjoy
that
dissi
pation
he
was
so
accustomed
to
that
he
de
cided
to
go
.
the
thought
immediately
occurred
i6
war
and
peace
to
him
that
his
promise
to
prince
andrew
was
of
no
account
because
before
he
gave
it
he
had
already
promised
prince
anatole
to
come
to
his
gathering
besides
thought
he
all
such
words
of
honor
are
conventional
things
with
no
definite
meaning
especially
if
one
considers
that
by
tomorrow
one
may
be
dead
or
something
so
extraordinary
may
happen
to
one
that
honor
and
dishonor
will
be
all
the
samel
pierre
often
indulged
in
reflections
of
this
sort
nullifying
all
his
decisions
and
in
tentions
.
he
went
to
kurdgins
.
reaching
the
large
house
near
the
horse
guards
barracks
in
which
anatole
lived
pierre
entered
the
lighted
porch
ascended
the
stairs
and
went
in
at
the
open
door
.
there
was
no
one
in
the
anteroom
empty
bottles
cloaks
and
overshoes
were
lying
about
there
was
a
smell
of
alcohol
and
sounds
of
voices
and
shouting
in
the
distance
.
cards
and
supper
were
over
but
the
visitors
had
not
yet
dispersed
.
pierre
threw
off
his
cloak
and
entered
the
first
room
in
which
were
the
remains
of
supper
.
a
footman
thinking
no
one
saw
him
was
drinking
on
the
sly
what
was
left
in
the
glasses
.
from
the
third
room
came
sounds
of
laughter
the
shouting
of
famil
iar
voices
the
growling
of
a
bear
and
general
commotion
.
some
eight
or
nine
young
men
were
crowding
anxiously
round
an
open
win
dow
.
three
others
were
romping
with
a
young
bear
one
pulling
him
by
the
chain
and
trying
to
set
him
at
the
others
.

the
host
a
tall
handsome
fellow
who
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
group
without
a
coat
and
with
his
fine
linen
shirt
unfastened
in
front
.
wait

you
fellows
.

.

.

.
here
is
pdtya
good
man
cried
he
addressing
pierre
.
another
voice
from
a
man
of
medium
height
with
clear
blue
eyes
particularly
strik
ing
among
all
these
drunken
voices
by
its
sober
ring
criedfrom
thewindow
comehere
part
the
bets
this
was
d61okhov
an
officer
of
the
semenov
regiment
a
notorious
gambler
and
duelist
who
was
living
with
anatole
.
pierre
smiled
looking
about
him
merrily
.
i
dont
understand
.
whats
it
all
about
wait
a
bit
he
is
not
drunk
yet
a
bottle
here
said
anatole
and
taking
a
glass
from
the
tale
he
went
up
to
pierre
.
first
of
all
you
must
drink
pierre
drank
one
glass
after
another
look
ing
from
under
his
brows
at
the
tipsy
guests
who
were
again
crowding
round
the
window
and
listening
to
their
chatter
.
anatole
kept
on
refilling
pierres
glass
while
explaining
that
d61okhov
was
betting
with
stevens
an
eng
lish
naval
officer
that
he
would
drink
a
bottle
of
rum
sitting
on
the
outer
ledge
of
the
third
floor
window
with
his
legs
hanging
out
.
go
on
you
must
drink
it
all
said
anatole
giving
pierre
the
last
glass
or
i
wont
let
you
go
no
i
wont
said
pierre
pushing
anatole
aside
and
he
went
up
to
the
window
.
d61okhov
was
holding
the
englishmans
hand
and
clearly
and
distinctly
repeating
the
terms
of
the
bet
addressing
himself
particu
larly
to
anatole
and
pierre
.
d61okhov
was
of
medium
height
with
curly
hair
and
lightblue
eyes
.
he
was
about
twenty
five
.
like
all
infantry
officers
he
wore
no
mus
tache
so
that
his
mouth
the
most
striking
feature
of
his
face
was
clearly
seen
.
the
lines
of
that
mouth
were
remarkably
finely
curved
.
the
middle
of
the
upper
lip
formed
a
sharp
wedge
and
closed
firmly
on
the
firm
lower
one
and
something
like
two
distinct
smiles
played
continually
round
the
two
corners
of
the
mouth
this
together
with
the
resolute
inso
lent
intelligence
of
his
eyes
produced
an
effect
which
made
it
impossible
not
to
notice
his
face
.
d61okhov
was
a
man
of
small
means
and
no
connections
.
yet
though
anatole
spent
tens
of
thousands
of
rubles
d61okhov
lived
with
him
and
had
placed
himself
on
such
a
footing
that
all
who
knew
them
including
ana
tole
himself

respected
him
more
than
they
did
anatole
.
d61okhov
could
play
all
games
and
nearly
always
won
.
however
much
he
drank
he
never
lost
his
clearheadedness
.
both
kurdgin
and
d61okhov
were
at
that
time
notorious
among
the
rakes
and
scapegraces
of
petersburg
.
the
bottle
of
rum
was
brought
.
the
window
frame
which
prevented
anyone
from
sitting
on
the
outer
sill
was
being
forced
out
by
two
footmen
who
were
evidently
flurried
and
in
timidated
by
the
directions
and
shouts
of
the
gentlemen
around
.
anatole
with
his
swaggering
air
strode
up
to
the
window
.
he
wanted
to
smash
something
.
pushing
away
the
footmen
he
tugged
at
the
frame
but
could
not
move
it
.
he
smashed
a
pane
.
book

a

said
he
burning
to
pierre
.
pierre
seized
the
crossbeam
tugged
and
wrenched
the
oak
frame
out
with
a
crash
.
take
it
right
out
or

looking
at

who
with
a
bottle
of

in
his

was
approaching
the

the

of

merging
with

of

was
visible

in

jumped
onto

he
standing
there
and
addressing

.
all

sitting
outside
the
window
on
this
spot
he
stooped
and
pointed
to
the
sloping
ledge
outside
the
window
and
with
out
holding
on
to
anything
.

that
right
quite
right
said
the
englishman
.
anatole
turned
to
the
englishman
and
tak
ing
him
by
one
of
the
buttons
of
his
coat
and
looking
down
at
him
the
englishman
was
short
began
repeating
the
terms
of
the
wager
to
him
in
english
.

cried
dolokhov
hammering
with
the
bottle
on
the
window
sill
to
attract

the
englishman
nodded
but
gave
no
in
dication
whether
he
intended
to
accept
this
challenge
or
not
.
anatole
did
not
release
him
and
though
he
kept
nodding
to
show
that
he
understood
anatole
went
on
translating
d6
lokhovs
words
into
english

a
thin
young
lad
an
hussar
of
the
life
guards
who
had
been
losing
that
evening
climbed
on
the
window
sill
leaned
over
and
looked
down
.
ohl
ohl
oh
he
muttered
looking
down
from
the
window
at
the
stones
of
the
pave
ment
.
shut
up
cried
d61okhov
pushing
him
away
from
the
window
.
the
lad
jumped
awk
wardly
back
into
the
room
tripping
over
his
spurs
.
placing
the
bottle
on
the
window
sill
where
he
could
reach
it
easily
d61okhov
climbed
carefully
and
slowly
through
the
window
and
lowered
his
legs
.
pressing
against
both
sides
of
the
window
he
adjusted
himself
on
his
seat
lowered
his
hands
moved
a
little
to
the
right
and
then
to
the
left
and
took
up
the
bottle
.
anatole
brought
two
candles
and
placed
them
on
the
window
sill
though
it
was
already
quite
light
.
dolokhovs
back
in
his
white
shirt
and
his
curly
head
were
lit
up
from
both
sides
.
everyone
crowded
to
the
window
the
english
man
in
front
.
pierre
stood
smiling
but
silent
.
one
man
older
than
the
others
present
sud
denly
pushed
forward
with
a
scared
and
angry
look
and
wanted
to
seize
hold
of
dolokhovs
shirt
.
i
say
this
is
folly
hell
be
killed
said
this
more
sensible
man
.
anatole
stopped
him
.
dont
touch
him
youll
startle
him
and
then
hell
be
killed
.
eh

..
.
what
then

.

.

.
eh
d61okhov
turned
round
and
again
holding
on
with
both
hands
arranged
himself
on
his
scat
.
if
anyone
comes
meddling
again
said
he
emitting
the
words
separately
through
his
thin
compressed
lips
i
willthrowhim
down
there
.
now
then
saying
this
he
again
turned
round
dropped
his
hands
took
the
bottle
and
lifted
it
to
his
lips
threw
back
his
head
and
raised
his
free
hand
to
balance
himself
.
one
of
the
footmen
who
had
stooped
to
pick
up
some
broken
glass
remained
in
that
position
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
window
and
from
d61okhovs
back
.
anatole
stood
erect
with
staring
eyes
.
the
englishman
looked
on
sideways
pursing
up
his
lips
.
the
man
who
had
wished
to
stop
the
affair
ran
to
a
corner
of
the
room
and
threw
himself
on
a
sofa
with
his
face
to
the
wall
.
pierre
hid
his
face
from
which
a
faint
smile
forgot
to
fade
though
his
features
now
expressed
horror
and
fear
.
all
were
still
.
pierre
took
his
hands
from
his
eyes
.
dolokhov
still
sat
in
the
same
position
only
his
head
was
thrown
further
back
till
his
curly
hair
touched
his
shirt
collar
and
the
hand
holding
the
bot
tle
was
lifted
higher
and
higher
and
trembled
with
the
effort
.
the
bottle
was
emptying
per
ceptibly
and
rising
still
higher
and
his
head
tilting
yet
further
back
.
why
is
it
so
long
thought
pierre
.
it
seemed
to
him
that
more
than
half
an
hour
had
elapsed
.
suddenly
d6
lokhov
made
a
backward
movement
with
his
i8
war
and
peace
spine
and
his
arm
trembled
nervously
this
was
sufficient
to
cause
his
whole
body
to
slip
as
he
sat
on
the
sloping
ledge
.
as
he
began
slip
ping
down
his
head
and
arm
wavered
still
more
with
the
strain
.
one
hand
moved
as
if
to
clutch
the
window
sill
but
refrained
from
touching
it
.
pierre
again
covered
his
eyes
and
thought
he
would
never
open
them
again
.
sud
denly
he
was
aware
of
a
stir
all
around
.
he
looked
up
d61okhov
was
standing
on
the
win
dow
sill
with
a
pale
but
radiant
face
.
its
empty
he
threw
the
bottle
to
the
englishman
who
caught
it
neatly
.
d61okhov
jumped
down
.
he
smelt
strongly
of
rum
.
well
done

.

.

.

.

.

.

a
bet
for
you

.

.

.
devil

came
from
different
sides
.
the
englishman
took
out
his
purse
and
be
gan
counting
out
the
money
.
drilokhov
stood
frowning
and
did
not
speak
.
pierre
jumped
upon
the
window
sill
.
gentlemen
who
wishes
to
bet
with
me

he
suddenly
cried
.

exclaimed
several
voices
.

shouted
pierre
banging
the
table
with
a
deter
mined
and
drunken
gesture
and
preparing
to
climb
out
of
the
window
.
they
seized
him
by
his
arms
but
he
was
so
strong
that
everyone
who
touched
him
was
sent
flying
.
no
youll
never
manage
him
that
way
said
anatole
.
wait
a
bit
and

cried
pierre
.

and
he
caught
the
bear
took
it
in
his
arms
lifted
it
from
the
ground
and
began
dancing
round
the
room
with
it

he

soon
after

anna

returned
to

went

to

rich

she
stayed

and
where

been

and
lived
for
years
at
a
time
.
the

had
already
left

on

tenth
of

and
her

who
had

for

to
join

on

since
the

carriages
with
six
horses
had
been
coming
and
going
continually
bringing
visi
tors
to
the
countess
rost6vas
big
house
on
the
povarskaya
so
well
known
to
all
moscow
.
the
countess
herself
and
her
handsome
eldest
daughter
were
in
the
drawingroom
with
the
visitors
who
came
to
congratulate
and
who
constantly
succeeded
one
another
in
relays
.
the
countess
was
a
woman
of
about
forty
five
with
a
thin
oriental
type
of
face
evidently
worn
out
with
childbearing
she
had
had

.
a
languor
of
motion
and
speech

sulting
from

gave
her
a
distinguished

which
inspired

princess
anna

kmylovna
drubetskdya
who
as
a
member
of
the
household
was
also
seated
in
the
drawing
room
helped
to
receive
and
entertain
the
visi
tors
.
the
young
people
were
in
one
of
the
inner
rooms
not
considering
it
necessary
to
take
part
in
receiving
the
visitors
.
the
count
met
the
guests
and
saw
them
off
inviting
them
all
to
dinner
.
i
am
very
very
grateful
to
you
mon

or
ma
chre
he
called
everyone
without
excep
tion
and
without
the
slightest
variation
in
his
tone
my

they
were
above
or
below

in

i
thank
you

shall
be

these
words
he
repeated
to
everyone
without
exception
or
variation
and
with
the
same
ex
pression
on
his
full
cheerful
cleanshaven
face
the
same
firm
pressure
of
the
hand
and
the
same
quick
repeated
bows
.
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
a
visitor
off
he
returned
to
one
of
those
who
were
still
in
the
drawing
room
book
one
drew
a
chair
toward
him
or
her
and
jauntily
spreading
out
his
legs
and
putting
hi
hands
on
his
knees
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
enjoys
life
and
knows
how
to
live
he
swayed
to
and
fro
with
dignity
offered
surmises
about
the
weather
or
touched
on
questions
of
health
sometimes
in
russian
and
sometimes
in
very
bad
but
selfconfident
french
then
again
like
a
man
weary
but
unflinching
in
the
fulfillment
of
duty
he
rose
to
see
some
visitors
off
and
stroking
his
scanty
gray
hairs
over
his
bald
patch
also
asked
them
to
dinner
.
sometimes
on
his
way
back
from
the
anteroom
he
would
pass
through
the
conservatory
and
pantry
into
the
large
marble
dining
hall
where
tables
were
being
set
out
for
eighty
people
and
looking
at
the
footmen
who
were
bringing
in
silver
and
china
moving
tables
and
unfolding
dam
ask
table
linen
he
would
call
dmitri
vasfle
vich
a
man
of
good
family
and
the
manager
of
all
his
affairs
and
while
looking
with
pleasure
at
the
enormous
table
would
say
well
dmitri
youll
see
that
things
are
all
as
they
should
be
thats
right
the
great
thing
is
the
serving
thats
it
.
and
with
a
complacent
sigh
he
would
return
to
the
drawing
room
.
mrya
lv6vna
kardgina
and
her
daugh
ter
announced
the
countess
gigantic
foot
man
in
his
bass
voice
entering
the
drawing
room
.
the
countess
reflected
a
moment
and
took
a
pinch
from
a
gold
snuffbox
with
her
husbands
portrait
on
it
.
im
quite
worn
out
by
these
callers

how
ever
ill
see
her
and
no
more
.
she
is
so
affected
.
ask
her

she
said
to
the
footman
in
a
sad
voice
as
if
saying

very
well
finish
me
off
.
a
tall
stout
and
proudlooking
woman
with
a
roundfaced
smiling
daughter
entered
the
drawing
room
their
dresses
rustling
.

.
came
the
sounds
of
animated
feminine
voices
interrupting
one
another
and
mingling
with
the
rustling
of
dresses
and
the
scraping
of
chairs
.
then
one
of
those
conver
sations
began
which
last
out
until
at
the
first
pause
the
guests
rise
with
a
rustle
of
dresses
and
say
i
am
so
delighted

.
and
countess
apraksina

.

.

.
and
then
again
rustling
pass
into
the
anteroom
put
on
cloaks
or
mantles
and
drive
away
.
the
conversation
was
on
the
chief
topic
of
the
day
the
illness
of
the
wealthy
and
celebrated
beau
of
catherines
day
count
bezukhovand
about
his
illegitimate
son
pierre
the
one
who
had
behaved
so
improperly
at
anna
pdvlovnas
re
ception
.
i
am
so
sorry
for
the
poor
count
said
the
visitor
.
he
is
in
such
bad
health
and
now
this
vexation
about
his
son
is
enough
to
kill
him
what
is
that
asked
the
countess
as
if
she
did
not
know
what
the
visitor
alluded
to
though
she
had
already
heard
about
the
cause
of
count
bezrikhovs
distress
some
fifteen
times
.
thats
what
comes
of
a
modern
educa
tion
exclaimed
the
visitor
.
it
seems
that
while
he
was
abroad
this
young
man
was
al
lowed
to
do
as
he
liked
and
now
in
petersburg
i
hear
he
has
been
doing
such
terrible
things
that
he
has
been
expelled
by
the
police
.
you
dont
say
so
replied
the
countess
.
he
chose
his
friends
badly
interposed
anna
mikhaylovna
.
prince
vasilis
son
he
and
a
certain
dolokhov
have
it
is
said
been
up
to
heaven
only
knows
what
and
they
have
had
to
suffer
for
it
.
d61okhov
has
been
de
graded
to
the
ranks
and
bezukhovs
son
sent
back
to
moscow
.
anatole
kurdgins
father
managed
somehow
to
get
his
sons
affair
hushed
up
but
even
he
was
ordered
out
of
petersburg
.
but
what
have
they
been
up
to
asked
the
countess
.
they
are
regular
brigands
especially
d6
lokhov
replied
f
the
visitor
.
he
is
a
son
of
mdrya
ivdnovna
d6tpkhova
such
a
worthy
woman
but
there
just
fancy
those
three
got
hold
of
a
bear
somewhere
put
it
in
a
carriage
and
set
off
with
it
to
visit
some
actresses
the
police
tried
to
interfere
and
what
did
the
young
men
do
they
tied
a
policeman
and
the
bear
back
to
back
and
put
the
bear
into
the
moyka
canal
.
and
there
was
the
bear
swim
ming
about
with
the
policeman
on
his
back
what
a
nice
figure
the
policeman
must
have
cut
my
dear
shouted
the
count
dying
with
laughter
oh
how
dreadful
how
can
you
laugh
at
it
count
yet
the
ladies
themselves
could
not
help
laughing
.
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
rescue
the
poor
man
continued
the
visitor
.
and
to
think
it
is
cyril
vladimirovich
bezukhovs
son
who
amuses
himself
in
this
sensible
manner
and
he
was
said
to
be
so
well
educated
and
clever
.
this
is
all
that
his
foreign
education
has
done
for
him
i
hope
that
here
in
moscow
no
one
will
receive
him
in
spite
of
his
money
.
they
wanted
to
introduce
him
to
me
but
i
quite
declined
i
have
my

princess
anna
mikmylovna
intervened
in
the
conversation
evidently
wishing
to
show
her
connections
and
knowledge
of
what
went
on
in
society

the
fact
of
the

said
she

also
in

a

the
countess

never

is
very
much
altered

anna

well
as

after

wrote
to

about

hes
also

added
as
if
she
attached
no
importance
at
all
to
the
fact
.
prince
vasili
arrived
in
moscow
yesterday
.
i
hear
he
has
come
on
some
inspection
busi
ness
remarked
the
visitor
.
yes
but
between
ourselves
said
the
prin
cess
that
is
a
pretext
.
the
fact
is
he
has
come
to
see
count
cyril
vladimirovich
hearing
how
ill
he
is
.
but
do
you
know
my
dear
that
was
a
capi
tal
joke
said
the
count
and
seeing
that
the
elder
visitor
was
not
listening
he
turned
to
the
young
ladies
.
i
can
just
imagine
what
a
funny
figure
that
policeman
cut
and
as
he
waved
his
arms
to
impersonate
the
policeman
his
portly
form
again
shook
with
a
deep
ringing
laugh
the
laugh
of
one
who
always
eats
well
and
in
particular
drinks
well
.
so
do
come
and
dine
with

said
.
chapter
xi
silence
ensued
.
the
countess
looked
at
her
callers
smiling
affably
but
not
concealing
the
fact
that
she
would
not
be
distressed
if
they
now
rse
and
took
their
leave
.
the
visitors
daughter
was
already
smoothing
down
her
dress
with
an
inquiring
look
at
her
mother
when
suddenly
from
the
next
room
were
heard
the
footsteps
of
boys
and
girls
running
to
the
door
and
the
noise
of
a
chair
falling
over
and
a
girl
of
thirteen
hiding
something
in
the
folds
of
her
short
muslin
frock
darted
in
and
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
it
was
evident
that
she
had
not
intended
her
flight
to
bring
her
so
far
.
behind
her
in
the
door
way
appeared
a
student
with
a
crimson
coat
collar
an
officer
of
the
guards
a
girl
of
fifteen
and
a
plump
rosyfaced
boy
in
a
short
jacket
.
the
count
jumped
up
and
swaying
from
side
to
side
spread
his
arms
wide
and
threw
them
round
the
little
girl
who
had
run
in
.
ah
here
she
is
he
exclaimed
laughing
.
my
pet
whose
name
day
it
is
.
my
dear
pet
ma
chtre
there
is
a
time
for
everything
said
the
countess
with
feigned
severity
.
you
spoil
her
ilya
she
added
turning
to
her
hus
band
.
how
do
you
do
my
dear
i
wish
you
many
happy
returns
of
your
name
day
said
the
visitor
.
what
a
charming
child
she
added
addressing
the
mother
.
this
blackeyed
widemouthed
girl
not
pretty
but
full
of
life
with
childish
bare
shoulders
which
after
her
run
heaved
and
shook
her
bodice
with
black
curls
tossed
back
ward
thin
bare
arms
little
legs
in
lacefrilled
drawers
and
feet
in
low
slippers
was
just
at
that
charming
age
when
a
girl
is
no
longer
a
child
though
the
child
is
not
yet
a
young
woman
.
escaping
from
her
father
she
ran
to
hide
her
flushed
face
in
the
lace
of
her
mothers
mantilla
not
paying
the
least
attention
to
her
severe
remark
and
began
to
laugh
.
she
laughed
and
in
fragmentary
sentences
tried
to
explain
about
a
doll
which
she
produced
from
the
folds
of
her
frock
.

was
all
natasha
managed
to
utter
to
her
everything
seemed
funny
.
she
leaned
against
her
mother
and
burst
into
such
a
loud
ringing
fit
of
laughter
that
even
the
prim
visi
tor
could
not
help
joining
in
.
now
then
go
a
way
and
take
your
monstros
ity
with
you
said
the
mother
pushing
away
her
daughter
with
pretended
sternness
and
turning
to
the
visitor
she
added
she
is
my
youngest
girl
.
natdsha
raising
her
face
for
a
moment
from
her
mothers
mantilla
glanced
up
at
her
through
tears
of
laughter
and
again
hid
her
face
.
the
visitor
compelled
to
look
on
at
this
family
scene
thought
it
necessary
to
take
some
part
in
it
.
tell
me
my
dear
said
she
to
natasha
is
mimi
a
relation
of
yours
a
daughter
i
suppose
natdsha
did
not
like
the
visitors
tone
of
condescension
to
childish
things
.
she
did
not
reply
but
looked
at
her
seriously
.
meanwhile
the
younger
generation
boris
the
officer
anna
mikhdylovnas
son
nicholas
the
undergraduate
the
counts
eldest
son
s6nya
the
counts
fifteenyearold
niece
and
little
ptya
his
youngest
boy
had
all
settled
down
in
the
drawing
room
and
were
obviously
trying
to
restrain
within
the
bounds
of
de
corum
the
excitement
and
mirth
that
shone
in
all
their
faces
.
evidently
in
the
back
rooms
from
which
they
had
dashed
out
so
impetu
ously
the
conversation
had
been
more
amus
ing
than
the
drawingroom
talk
of
society
scan
dals
the
weather
and
countess
apraksina
.
now
and
then
they
glanced
at
one
another
hardly
able
to
suppress
their
laughter
.
the
two
young
men
the
student
and
the
officer
friends
from
childhood
were
of
the
same
age
and
both
handsome
fellows
though
not
alike
.
boris
was
tall
and
fair
and
his
calm
and
handsome
face
had
regular
delicate
fea
tures
.
nicholas
was
short
with
curly
hair
and
an
open
expression
.
dark
hairs
were
already
showing
on
his
upper
lip
and
his
whole
face
expressed
impetuosity
and
enthusiasm
.
nicho
las
blushed
when
he
entered
the
drawingroom
.
he
evidently
tried
to
find
something
to
say
but
failed
.
boris
on
the
contrary
at
once
found
his
footing
and
related
quietly
and
humor
ously
how
he
had
known
that
doll
mimi
when
she
was
still
quite
a
young
lady
before
her
nose
was
broken
how
she
had
aged
during
the
five
years
he
had
known
her
and
how
her
head
had
cracked
right
across
the
skull
.
having
said
this
he
glanced
at
natdsha
.
she
turned
away
from
him
and
glanced
at
her
younger
brother
who
was
screwing
up
his
eyes
and
shaking
with
suppressed
laughter
and
unable
to
con
trol
herself
any
longer
she
jumped
up
and
rushed
from
the
room
as
fast
as
her
nimble
little
feet
would
carry
her
.
boris
did
not
laugh
.
you
were
meaning
to
go
out
werent
you
mamma
do
you
want
the
carriage
he
asked
his
mother
with
a
smile
.
yes
yes
go
and
tell
them
to
get
it
ready
she
answered
returning
his
smile

boris
quietly
left
the
room
and
went
in
search
of
natasha
.
the
plump
boy
ran
after
them
angrily
as
if
vexed
that
their
program
had
been
disturbed
.
the
only
young
people
remaining
in
the
drawing
room
not
counting
the
young
lady
visitor
and
the
countess
eldest
daughter
who
was
four
years
older
than
her
sister
and
be
haved
already
like
a
grownup
person
were
nicholas
and
s6nya
the
niece
.
s6nya
was
a
slender
little
brunette
with
a
tender
look
in
her
eyes
which
were
veiled
by
long
lashes
thick
black
plaits
coiling
twice
round
her
head
and
a
tawny
tint
in
her
complexion
and
espe
cially
in
the
color
of
her
slender
but
graceful
and
muscular
arms
and
neck
.
by
the
grace
of
her
movements
by
the
softness
and
flexibility
of
her
small
limbs
and
by
a
certain
coyness
and
reserve
of
manner
she
reminded
one
of
a
pretty
halfgrown
kitten
which
promises
to
become
a
beautiful
little
cat
.
she
evidently
considered
it
proper
to
show
an
interest
in
the
general
conversation
by
smiling
but
in
spite
of
herself
her
eyes
under
their
thick
long
lashes
watched
her
cousin
who
was
going
to
join
the
army
with
such
passionate
girlish
adoration
that
her
smile
could
not
for
a
single
instant
impose
upon
anyone
and
it
was
clear
that
the
kitten
had
settled
down
only
to
spring
up
with
more
energy
and
again
play
with
her
cousin
as
soon
as
they
too
could
like
natdsha
and
boris
escape
from
the
drawing
room
.
ah
yes
my
dear
said
the
count
addressing
the
visitor
and
pointing
to
nicholas
his
friend
borfs
has
become
an
officer
and
so
for
friendships
sake
he
is
leaving
the
university
and
me
his
old
father
and
entering
the
mili
tary
service
my
dear
.
and
there
was
a
place
and
everything
waiting
for
him
in
the
archives
department
isnt
that
friendship
remarked
the
count
in
an
inquiring
tone
.
but
they
say
that
war
has
been
declared
replied
the
visitor
.
theyve
been
saying
so
a
long
while
said
the
count
and
theyll
say
so
again
and
again
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
it
.

dear
theres
friendship
for
you
he
repeated
.

the
visitor
not
knowing
what
to
say
shook
her
head
.
its
not
at
all
from
friendship
declared
nicholas
flaring
up
and
turning
away
as
it
from
a
shameful
aspersion
.
it
is
not
from
friendship
at
all
i
simply
feel
that
the
army
is
my
vocation
.

and
peace
he
glanced
at
his
cousin
and
the
young
lady
visitor
and
they
were
both
regarding
him
with
a
smile
of
approbation
.

him

cant

said
the
count
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
speaking
playfully
of
a
mat
ter
that
evidently
distressed
him
.
i

already
told

as
he
spoke
he
kept
glancing
with
the
flirtatiousness
of
a
handsome
youth
at
s6nya
and
the
young
lady
visitor
.
the
little
kitten
feasting
her
eyes
on
him
seemed
ready
at
any
moment
to
start
her
gam
bols
again
and
display
her
kittenish
nature

the

all

all

of
how

rose
from

added
not
noticing
his

the

talking
about

werent
at
the

on
thursday
.
it
was
so
dull
without

said
she
giving
him
a
tender
smile
.
the
young
man
flattered
sat
down
nearer
to
her
with
a
coquettish
smile
and
engaged
the
smiling
julie
in
a
confidential
conversa
tion
without
at
all
noticing
that
his
involun
tary
smile
had
stabbed
the
heart
of
s6nya
who
blushed
and
smiled
unnaturally
.
in
the
midst
of
his
talk
he
glanced
round
at
her
.
she
gave
him
a
passionately
angry
glance
and
hardly
able
to
restrain
her
tears
and
maintain
the
artificial
smile
on
her
lips
she
got
up
and
left
the
room
.
all
nicholas
animation
vanished

the

when
the

people
had

into

vanished

as
if

one
has
had
to
go
through
that
we
might
rejoice
in
them
now
and
yet
really
the
anxiety
is
greater
now
than
the
joy
.
one
is
always
always
anxious
especially
just
at
this
age
so
dangerous
both
for

it

the

with

went
on

occupied

were
to

to

goodness
knows
what
they
might
be
up
to

the
sly
she
meant
that
they
would
be
kissing

as
it
is
i
know
every
word
she
utters

she
will
come
running
to
me
of
her
own
accord
in
the
evening

tell
me
everything

perhaps
i
spoil
her

that

the

gave

an
unnatural
and

unpleasant
expression

had

pleasant
voice
what
she

true
and
appropriate
yet
strange
to
say
every
onethe
visitors
and
countess
aliketurned
to
look
at
her
as
if
wondering
why
she
had
said
it
and
they
all
felt
awkward
.
people

always
too
clever
with
their
eld
est
children

try
to
make
something
excep
tional
of
them
said
the
visitor
.
whats
the
good
of
denying

my
dear
our
dear
countess

too
clever
with

said
the
count
.

what
of
that

turned

at

the
guests
got
up
and
took
their
leave
promising
to
return
to
dinner

what
manners
i
thought

would
never

said
the
countess
when
she
had
seen
her
guests
out
.
chapter
xiii
when
natdsha
ran
out
of
the
drawing
room
she
only
went
as
far
as
the
conservatory
.
there
she
paused
and
stood
listening
to
the
conver
sation
in
the
drawing
room
waiting
for
boris
to
come
out
.
she
was
already
growing
impa
tient
and
stamped
her
foot
ready
to
cry
at
his
not
coming
at
once
when
she
heard
the
young
mans
discreet
steps
approaching
neither
quick
ly
nor
slowly
.
at
this
natasha
dashed
swiftly
among
the
flower
tubs
and
hid
there
.
boris
paused
in
the
middle
of
the
room
looked
round
brushed
a
little
dust
from
the
sleeve
of
his
uniform
and
going
up
to
a
mirror
examined
his
handsome
face
.
natdsha
very
still
peered
out
from
her
ambush
waiting
to
see
what
he
would
do
.
he
stood
a
little
while
before
the
glass
smiled
and
walked
toward
the
other
door
.
natasha
was
about
to
call
him
but
changed
her
mind
.
let
him
look
for
me
thought
she
.
hardly
had
boris
gone
than
s6nya
flushed
in
tears
and
muttering
angrily
came
in
at
the
other
door
.
natdsha
checked
her
first
impulse
to
run
out
to
her
and
re
mained
in
her
hiding
place
watching
as
un
der
an
invisible
cap
to
see
what
went
on
in
the
world
.
she
was
experiencing
a
new
and
pecul
iar
pleasure
.
s6nya
muttering
to
herself
kept
looking
round
toward
the
drawingroom
door
.
it
opened
and
nicholas
came
in
.
s6nya
what
is
the
matter
with
you
how
can
you
said
he
running
up
to
her
.
its
nothing
nothing
leave
me
alone
sobbed
s6nya
.
ah
i
know
what
it
is
.
well
if
you
do
so
much
the
better
and
you
can
go
back
to
her
s6oonya
look
here
how
can
you
tor
ture
me
and
yourself
like
that
for
a
mere
fancy
said
nicholas
taking
her
hand
.
s6nya
did
not
pull
it
away
and
left
off
cry
ing
.
natdsha
not
stirring
and
scarcely
breath
ing
watched
from
her
ambush
with
sparkling
eyes
.
what
will
happen
now
thought
she
.
sonya
what
is
anyone
in
the
world
to
me
you
alone
are
everything
said
nicholas
.
and
i
will
prove
it
to
you
.
i
dont
like
you
to
talk
like
that
.
well
then
i
wont
only
forgive
me
s6nya
he
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
.
oh
how
nice
thought
natdsha
and
when
s6nya
and
nicholas
had
gone
out
of
the
con
servatory
she
followed
and
called
boris
to
her
.
boris
come
here
said
she
with
a
sly
and
significant
look
.
i
have
something
to
tell
you
.
here
here
and
she
led
him
into
the
conserv
atory
to
the
place
among
the
tubs
where
she
had
been
hiding
.
boris
followed
her
smiling
.
what
is
the
something
asked
he
.
she
grew
confused
glanced
round
and
see
ing
the
doll
she
had
thrown
down
on
one
of
the
tubs
picked
it
up
.
kiss
the
doll
said
she
.
boris
looked
attentively
and
kindly
at
her
eager
face
but
did
not
reply
.
dont
you
want
to
well
then
come
here
said
she
and
went
further
in
among
the
plants
and
threw
down
the
doll
.
closer
closer
she
whispered
.
she
caught
the
young
officer
by
his
cuffs
and
a
look
of
solemnity
and
fear
appeared
on
her
flushed
face
.
and
me
would
you
like
to
kiss
me
she
whispered
almost
inaudibly
glancing
up
at
him
from
under
her
brows
smiling
and
al
most
crying
from
excitement
.
boris
blushed
.
how
funny
you
are
he
said
bending
down
to
her
and
blushing
still
more
but
he
waited
and
did
nothing
.
suddenly
she
jumped
up
onto
a
tub
to
be
higher
than
he
embraced
him
so
that
both
her
slender
bare
arms
clasped
him
above
his
neck
and
tossing
back
her
hair
kissed
him
full
on
the
lips
.
then
she
slipped
down
among
the
flower
pots
on
the
other
side
of
the
tubs
and
stood
hanging
her
head
.
natdsha
he
said
you
know
that
i
love
you
but

.

.

.
you
are
in
love
with
me
natdsha
broke
in
.
24
yes
i
am
but
please
dont
let
us
do
like
that
.

..
.
in
another
four
years

.

.

.
then
i
will
ask
for
your
hand
.
natasha
considered
.
thirteen

fifteen
sixteen
she
counted
on
her
slender
little
fingers
.
all
rightl
then
its
settled
a
smile
of
joy
and
satisfaction
lit
up
her
eager
face
.
settled
replied
boris
.
forever
said
the
little
girl
.
till
death
itself
she
took
his
arm
and
with
a
happy
face
went
with
him
into
the
adjoining
sitting
room
.
chapter
xiv
after
receiving
her
visitors
the
countess
was
so
tired
that
she
gave
orders
to
admit
no
more
but
the
porter
was
told
to
be
sure
to
invite
to
dinner
all
who
came
to
congratulate
.
the
countess
wished
to
have
a
teteatete
talk
with
the
friend
of
her
childhood
princess
anna
mikhdylovna
whom
she
had
not
seen
properly
since
she
returned
from
petersburg
.
anna
mikhiylovna
with
her
tear
worn
but
pleasant
face
drew
her
chair
nearer
to
that
of
the
countess
.
with
you
i
will
be
quite
frank
said
anna
mikmylovna
.
there
are
not
many
left
of
us
old
friends
thats
why
i
so
value
your
friend
ship
.
anna
mikhdylovna
looked
at
wra
and
paused
.
the
countess
pressed
her
friends
hand
.
wra
she
said
to
her
eldest
daughter
who
was
evidently
not
a
favorite
how
is
it
you
have
so
little
tact
dont
you
see
you
are
not
wanted
here
go
to
the
other
girls
or

..
.
the
handsome
wra
smiled
contemptuously
but
did
not
seem
at
all
hurt
.
if
you
had
told
me
sooner
mamma
i
would
have
gone
she
replied
as
she
rose
to
go
to
her
own
room
.
but
as
she
passed
the
sitting
room
she
no
ticed
two
couples
sitting
one
pair
at
each
win
dow
.
she
stopped
and
smiled
scornfully
.
s6nya
was
sitting
close
to
nicholas
who
was
copying
out
some
verses
for
her
the
first
he
had
ever
written
.
boris
and
natdsha
were
at
the
other
window
and
ceased
talking
when
wra
entered
.
s6nya
and
natasha
looked
at
wra
with
guilty
happy
faces
.
it
was
pleasant
and
touching
to
see
these
little
girls
in
love
but
apparently
the
sight
of
them
roused
no
pleasant
feeling
in
wra
.
how
often
have
i
asked
you
not
to
take
my
things
she
said
.
you
have
a
room
of
your
war
and
peace
own

and
she
took
the
inkstand
from
nicholas
.
in
a
minute
in
a
minute
he
said
dipping
his
pen
.
you
always
manage
to
do
things
at
the
wrong
time
continued
wra
.
you
came
rushing
into
the
drawing
room
so
that
every
one
felt
ashamed
of
you
.
though
what
she
said
was
quite
just
per
haps
for
that
very
reason
no
one
replied
and
the
four
simply
looked
at
one
another
.
she
lingered
in
the
room
with
the
inkstand
in
her
hand
.
and
at
your
age
what
secrets
can
there
be
between
natdsha
and
boris
or
between
you
two
its
all
nonsense
now
wra
what
does
it
matter
to
you
said
natasha
in
defense
speaking
very
gently
.
she
seemed
that
day
to
be
more
than
ever
kind
and
affectionate
to
everyone
.
very
silly
said
wra
.
i
am
ashamed
of
you
.
secrets
indeed
all
have
secrets
of
their
own
answered
natasha
getting
warmer
.
we
dont
interfere
with
you
and
berg
.
i
should
think
not
said
wra
because
there
can
never
be
anything
wrong
in
my
be
havior
.
but
ill
just
tell
mamma
how
you
are
behaving
with
boris
.
natlyallynichna
behaves
very
well
to
me
remarked
boris
.
i
have
nothing
to
complain
of
.
dont
boris
you
are
such
a
diplomat
that
it
is
really
tiresome
said
natasha
in
a
morti
fied
voice
that
trembled
slightly
.
she
used
the
word
diplomat
which
was
just
then
much
in
vogue
among
the
children
in
the
special
sense
they
attached
to
it
.
why
does
she
bother
me
and
she
added
turning
to
wra
youll
never
understand
it
because
youve
never
loved
anyone
.
you
have
no
heart
you
are
a
madame
de
genlis
1
and
nothing
more
this
nickname
bestowed
on
wra
by
nicholas
was
considered
very
stinging
and
your
great
est
pleasure
is
to
be
unpleasant
to
people
go
and
flirt
with
berg
as
much
as
you
please
she
finished
quickly
.
i
shall
at
any
rate
not
run
after
a
young
man
before
visitors

..
.
well
now
youve
done
what
you
wanted
put
in
nicholas
said
unpleasant
things
to
everyone
and
upset
them
.
lets
go
to
the
nurs
ery
.
all
four
like
a
flock
of
scared
birds
got
up
and
left
the
room
.
a
french
writer
of
that
period

of
educational
works
and
novels

unpleasant
things

vera
i
said

to
anyone
.
madame

genlis
madame
de
genlisi
shouted
laughing
voices
through
the
door
.
the
handsome
vdra
who
produced
such
an
irritating
and
unpleasant
effect
on
everyone
smiled
and
evidently
unmoved
by
what
had
been
said
to
her
went
to
the
looking
glass
and
arranged
her
hair
and
scarf
.
looking
at
her
own
handsome
face
she
seemed
to
become
still
colder
and
calmer
.
in
the
drawing
room
the
conversation
was
still
going
on
.
ah
my
dear
said
the
countess
my
life
is
not
all
roses
either
.
dont
i
know
that
at
the
rate
we
are
living
our
means
wont
last
long
its
all
the
club
and
his
easygoing
nature
.
even
in
the
country
do
we
get
any
rest
theatricals
hunting
and
heaven
knows
what
besides
but
dont
lets
talk
about
me
tell
me
how
you
managed
every
th
ing
.
i
often
wonder
at
you
annette
how
at
your
age
you
can
rush
off
alone
in
a
carriage
to
moscow
to
petersburg
to
those
ministers
and
great
people
and
know
how
to
deal
with
them
all
its
quite
astonish
ing
.
how
did
you
get
things
settled
i
couldnt
possibly
do
it
.
ah
my
love
answered
anna
mikhaylovna
god
grant
you
never
know
what
it
is
to
be
left
a
widow
without
means
and
with
a
son
you
love
to
distraction
one
learns
many
things
then
she
added
with
a
certain
pride
.
that
lawsuit
taught
me
much
.
when
i
want
to
see
one
of
those
big
people
i
write
a
note
prin
cess
soandso
desires
an
interview
with
so
andso
and
then
i
take
a
cab
and
go
myself
two
three
or
four
times
till
i
get
what
i
want
.
i
dont
mind
what
they
think
of
me
.
well
and
to
whom
did
you
apply
about
bory
asked
the
countess
.
you
see
yours
is
already
an
officer
in
the
guards
while
my
nicholas
is
going
as
a
cadet
.
theres
no
one
to
interest
himself
for
him
.
to
whom
did
you
apply
to
prance
vasfli
.
he
was
so
kind
.
he
at
once
agreed
to
everything
and
put
the
matter
before
the
emperor
said
princess
anna
mi
khdylovna
enthusiastically
quite
forgetting
all
the
humiliation
she
had
endured
to
gain
her
end
.
has
prince
vasfli
aged
much
asked
the
countess
.
i
have
not
seen
him
since
we
acted
together
at
the
rumydntsovs
theatricals
.
i
ex
pect
he
has
forgotten
me
.
he
paid
me
attentions
in
those
days
said
the
countess
with
a
smile
.
he
is
just
the
same
as
ever
replied
anna
mikhdylovna
overflowing
with
amiability
.
his
position
has
not
turned
his
head
at
all
.
he
said
to
me
i
am
sorry
i
can
do
so
little
for
you
dear
princess
.
i
am
at
your
command
.
yes
he
is
a
fine
fellow
and
a
very
kind
rela
tion
.
but
nataly
you
know
my
love
for
my
son
i
would
do
anything
for
his
happiness
and
my
affairs
are
in
such
a
bad
way
that
my
position
is
now
a
terrible
one
continued
anna
mikhaylovna
sadly
dropping
her
voice
.
my
wretched
lawsuit
takes
all
i
have
and
makes
no
progress
.
would
you
believe
it
i
have
literally
not
a
penny
and
dont
know
how
to
equip
boris
.
she
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
began
to
cry
.
i
need
five
hundred
rubles
and
have
only
one
twentyfiveruble
note
.
i
am
in
such
a
state
.

.

.

.
my
only
hope
now
is
in
count
cyril
vladimirovich
beziikhov
.
if
he
will
not
assist
his
godson
you
know
he
is
borys
godfather
and
allow
him
something
for
his
maintenance
all
my
trouble
will
have
been
thrown
away
.

..
.
i
shall
not
be
able
to
equip
him
.
the
countess
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
pondered
in
silence
.
i
often
think
though
perhaps
its
a
sin
said
the
princess
that
here
lives
count
cyril
vladfmirovith
beziikhov
so
rich
all
alone

.

.

.
that
tremendous
fortune

.

.

.
and
what
is
his
life
worth
its
a
burden
to
him
and
b6rys
life
is
only
just
beginning
.

.

.

.
surely
he
will
leave
something
to
boris
said
the
countess
.
heaven
only
knows
my
dear
these
rich
grandees
are
so
selfish
.
still
i
will
take
borfs
and
go
to
see
him
at
once
and
i
shall
speak
to
him
straight
out
.
let
people
think
what
they
will
of
me
its
really
all
the
same
to
me
when
my
sons
fate
is
at

the
princess
rose
.

in

they
were

drove
over
the
strawcovered
street
and
turned
into
the
wide
courtyard
of
count
cyril
vladfmirovich
bezu
khovshouse
.
my
dear
boris
said
the
mother
drawing
her
hand
from
beneath
her
old
man

and
laying
it
timidly
and
tenderly
on
her
sons
arm

affectionate
and
attentive
to
him
.
count
cyril
vladimirovich
is
your
god
father
after
all
and
your
future
depends
on
him
.
remember
that
my
dear
and
be
nice
to
him
as
you
so
well
know
how
to
be
.
if

knew
that
anything
besides

answered
her
son
coldly
.
but
i
have
promised
and
will
do
it
for
your
sake
.
although
the
hall
porter
saw
someones
carriage
standing
at
the
entrance
after
scru
tinizing
the
mother
and
son
who
without
ask
ing
to
be
announced
had
passed
straight
through
the
glass
porch
between
the
rows
of
statues
in
niches
and
looking
significantly
at
the
ladys
old
cloak
he
asked
whether
they
wanted
the
count
or
the
princesses
and
hear
ing
that
they
wished
to
see
the
count
said
his
excellency
was
worse
today
and
that
his
excel
lency
was
not
receiving
anyone
.
we
may
as
well
go
back
said
the
son
in
french
.
my
dear
exclaimed
his
mother
implor
ingly
again
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
as
if
that
touch
might
soothe
or
rouse
him
.
boris
said
no
more
but
looked
inquiringly
at
his
mother
without
taking
off
his
cloak
.
my
friend
said
anna
mikhlylovna
in
gentle
tones
addressing

he
called
to
a
footman
dressed
in
knee
breeches
shoes
and
a
swallowtail
coat
who
ran
downstairs
and
looked
over
from
the
halfway
landing
.
the
mother
smoothed
the
folds
of
her
dyed
silk
dress
before
a
large
venetian
mirror
in
the
wajl
and
in
her
troddendown

ascended
the
carpeted
stairs
.
my
dear
she
said
to
her
son
once
more
stimulating
him
by
a
touch
you
promised
me
the
son
lowering
his
eyes
followed
her
quietly
.
they
entered
the
large
hall
from
which
one
of
the
doors
led
to
the
apartments
assigned
to
prince
vasili
.
just
as
the
mother
and
son
having
reached
the
middle
of
the
hall
were
about
to
ask
their
way
of
an
elderly
footman
who
had
sprung
up
as
they
entered
the
bronze
handle
of
one
of
the
doors
turned
and
prince
vasili
came
out
wearing
a
velvet
coat
with
a
single
star
on
his
breast
as
was
his
custom
when
at
home
tak
ing
leave
of
a
goodlooking
darkhaired
man
.
this
was
the
celebrated
petersburg
doctor
lorrain
.

the
prince

.
seeing
anna
mikhdylovna
and
her
son
prince
vasili
dismissed
the
doctor
with
a
bow
and
approached
them
silently
and
with
a
look
of
inquiry
.
the
son
noticed
that
an
expression
of
profound
sorrow
suddenly
clouded
his
mothers
face
and
he
smiled
slightly
.
ah
prince
in
what
sad
circumstances
we
meet
again
and
how
is
our
dear
invalid
said
she
as
though
unaware
of
the
cold
of
fensive
look
fixed
on
her
.
prince
vasili
stared
at
her
and
at
boris
ques
tioningly
and
perplexed
.
boris
bowed
polite
ly
.
prince
vasili
without
acknowledging
the
bow
turned
to
anna
mikhdylovna
answering
her
query
by
a
movement
of
the
head
and
lips
indicating
very
little
hope
for
the
patient
.
is
it
possible
exclaimed
anna
mikhdy
lovna
.
oh
how
awful
it
is
terrible
to
think
.

.

.

.
this
is
my
son
she
added
indicating
boris
.
he
wanted
to
thank
you
himself
.
boris
bowed
again
politely
.

he
went
on
in
his

tone
of
indifference

i

awaiting

your
excellency
replied
boris
betray
ing
neither
annoyance
at
the
princes
brusque
manner
nor
a
desire
to
enterinto
conversation
but
speaking
so
quietly
and
respectfully
that
the
prince
gave
him
a
searching
glance
.
are
you
living
with
your
mother
i
am
living
at

replied
boris
again
adding
your
excellency
.
that
is
with
ilyd
rost6v
who
married
na
taly
shinshina
said
anna
mikhaylovna
.
i
know
i
know
answered
prince
vasili
in
his
monotonous
voice
.
i
never
could
under
stand
how
nataly
made
up
her
mind
to
marry
that
unlicked
bear
a
perfectly
absurd
and
stupid
fellow
and
a
gambler
too
i
am
told
.
but
a
very
kind
man
prince
said
anna
mikhaylovna
with
a
pathetic
smile
as
though
she
too
knew
that
count
rost6v
deserved
this
censure
but
asked
him
not
to
be
too
hard
on
the
poor
old
man
.
what
do
the
doctors
say
asked
the
princess
after
a
pause
her
worn
face
again
expressing
deep
sorrow
.
they
give
little
hope
replied
the
prince
.
and
i
should
so
like
to
thank
uncle
once
for
all
his
kindness
to
me
and
boris
.
he
is
his
godson
she
added
her
tone
suggesting
that
this
fact
ought
to
give
prince
vasili
much
satis
faction
.
prince
vasili
became
thoughtful
and
frowned
.
anna
mikhdylovna
saw
that
he
was
afraid
of
finding
in
her
a
rival
for
count
be
zukhovs
fortune
and
hastened
to
reassure
him
.
if
it
were
not
for
my
sincere
affection
and
devotion
to
uncle
said
she
uttering
the
word
with
peculiar
assurance
and
unconcern
i
know
his
character
noble
upright

.

.

.
but
you
see
he
has
no
one
with
him
except
the
young
princesses
.

.

.

.
they
are
still
young
.

.

.

.
she
bent
her
head
and
continued
in
a
whisper
has
he
performed
his
final
duty
prince
how
priceless
are
those
last
moments
it
can
make
things
no
worse
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
prepare
him
if
he
is
so
ill
.
we
women
prince
and
she
smiled
tenderly
always
know
how
to
say
these
things
.
i
absolutely
must
see
him
however
painful
it
may
be
for
me
.
i
am
used
to
suffering
.
evidently
the
prince
understood
her
and
al
so
understood
as
he
had
done
at
anna
pdvlov
nas
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
get
rid
of
anna
mikhlylovna
.
would
not
such
a
meeting
be
too
trying
for
him
dear
anna
mikhdylovna
said
he
.
let
us
wait
until
evening
.
the
doctors
are
expect
ing
a
crisis
.
but
one
cannot
delay
prince
at
such
a
mo
ment
consider
that
the
welfare
of
his
soul
is
at
stake

ah
it
is
awful
the
duties
of
a
chris
tian

.

a
door
of
one
of
the
inner
rooms
opened
and
one
of
the
princesses
the
counts
niece
entered
with
a
cold
stern
face
.
the
length
of
her
body
was
strikingly
out
of
proportion
to
her
short
legs
.
prince
vasili
turned
to
her
.
well
how
is
he
still
the
same
but
what
can
you
expect
this
noise

.

.

.
said
the
princess
looking
at
anna
mikhlylovna
as
at
a
stranger
.
ah
my
dear
i
hardly
knew
you
said
anna
mikhdylovna
with
a
happy
smile
ambling
lightly
up
to
the
counts
niece
.
i
have
come
and
am
at
your
service
to
help
you
nurse
my
uncle
.
i
imagine
what
you
have
gone
through
and
she
sympathetically
turned
up
her
eyes
.
the
princess
gave
no
reply
and
did
not
even
smile
but
left
the
room
at
once
.
anna
mikhay
lovna
took
off
her
gloves
and
occupying
the
position
she
had
conquered
settled
down
in
an
armchair
inviting
prince
vasfli
to
take
a
seat
beside
her
.
boris
she
said
to
her
son
with
a
smile
i
shall
go
in
to
see
the
count
my
uncle
but
you
my
dear
had
better
go
to
pierre
meanwhile
and
dont
forget
to
give
him
the
rost6vs
invita
tion
.
they
ask
him
to
dinner
.
i
suppose
he
wont
go
she
continued
turning
to
the
prince
.
on
the
contrary
replied
the
prince
who
had
plainly
become
depressed
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
if
you
relieve
me
of
that
young
man
.

.

.

.
here
he
is
and
the
count
has
not
once
asked
for
him
.
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
a
footman
con
ducted

down

flight
of

and
up

chapter
xvi
pierre
after
all
had
not
managed
to
choose
a
career
for
himself
in
petersburg
and
had
been
expelled
from
there
for
riotous
conduct
and
sent
to
moscow
.
the
story
told
about
him
at
count
rost6vs
was
true
.
pierre
had
taken
part
in
tying
a
policeman
to
a
bear
.
he
had
now
been
for
some
days
in
moscow
and
was
staying
as
usual
at
his
fathers
house
.
though
he
ex
pected
that
the
story
of
his
escapade
would
be
war
and
peace
already
known
in
moscow
and
that
the
ladies
about
his
father
who
were
never
favorably
disposed
toward
him
would
have
used
it
to
turn
the
count
against
him
he
nevertheless
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
went
to
his
fathers
part
of
the
house
.
entering
the
drawing
room
where
the
princesses
spent
most
of
their
time
he
greeted
the
ladies
two
of
whom
were
sitting
at
embroidery
frames
while
a
third
read
aloud
.
it
was
the
eldest
who
was
reading
the
one
who
had
met
anna
mikhdylovna
.
the
two
younger
ones
were
embroidering
both
were
rosy
and
pretty
and
they
differed
only
in
that
one
had
a
little
mole
on
her
lip
which
made
her
much
prettier
.
pierre
was
received
as
if
he
were
a
corpse
or
a
leper
.
the
eldest
princess
paused
in
her
reading
and
silently
stared
at
him
with
frightened
eyes
the
second
assumed
precisely
the
same
expression
while
the
youngest
the
one
with
the
mole
who
was
of
a
cheerful
and
lively
disposition
bent
over
her
frame
to
hide
a
smile
probably
evoked
by
the
amusing
scene
she
foresaw
.
she
drew
her
wool
down
through
the
canvas
and
scarcely
able
to
refrain
from
laughing
stooped
as
if
trying
to
make
out
the
pattern
.
how
do
you
do
cousin
said
pierre
.
you
dont
recognize
me
i
recognize
you
only
too
well
too
well
.
how
is
the
count
can
i
see
him
asked
pierre
awkwardly
as
usual
but
unabashed
.
the
count
is
suffering
physically
and
men
tally
and
apparently
you
have
done
your
best
to
increase
his
mental
sufferings
.
can
i
see
the
count
pierre
again
asked
.
hm
if
you
wish
to
kill
him
to
kill
him
outright
you
can
see
him

.

.

.
olga
go
and
see
whether
uncles
beef
tea
is
ready
it
is
almost
time
she
added
giving
pierre
to
understand
that
they
were
busy
and
busy
making
his
fa
ther
comfortable
while
evidently
he
pierre
was
only
busy
causing
him
annoyance
.
olga
went
out
.
pierre
stood
looking
at
the
sisters
then
he
bowed
and
said
then
i
will
go
to
my
rooms
.
you
will
let
me
know
when
i
can
see
him
.
and
he
left
the
room
followed
by
the
low
but
ringing
laughter
of
the
sister
with
the
mole
.
next
day
prince
vasili
had
arrived
and
set
tled
in
the
counts
house
.
he
sent
for
pierre
and
said
to
him
my
dear
fellow
if
you
are
going
to
behave
here
as
you
did
in
petersburg
you
will
end
very
badly
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
to
you
.
the
count
is
very
very
ill
and
you
must
not
see
him
at
all
.
since
then
pierre
had
not
been
disturbed
and
had
spent
the
whole
time
in
his
rooms
up
stairs
.
c
when
boris
appeared
at
his
door
pierre
was
pacing
up
and
down
his
room
stopping
occa
sionally
at
a
corner
to
make
menacing
gestures
at
the
wall
as
if
running
a
sword
through
an
invisible
foe
and
glaring
savagely
over
his
spectacles
and
then
again
resuming
his
walk
muttering
indistinct
words
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
gesticulating
.
england
is
done
for
said
he
scowling
and
pointing
his
finger
at
someone
unseen
.
mr
.
pitt
as
a
traitor
to
the
nation
and
to
the
rights
of
man
is
sentenced
to

.

.

.
but
before
pierre
who
at
that
moment
imagined
himself
to
be
napoleon
in
person
and
to
have
just
effected
the
dangerous
crossing
of
the
straits
of
dover
and
captured
london
could
pronounce
pitts
sentence
he
saw
a
wellbuilt
and
handsome
young
officer
entering
his
room
.
pierre
paused
.
he
had
left
moscow
when
boris
was
a
boy
01
fourteen
and
had
quite
forgotten
him
but
in
his
usual
impulsive
and
hearty
way
he
took
boris
by
the
hand
with
a
friendly
smile
.
do
you
remember
me
asked
boris
quietly
with
a
pleasant
smile
.
i
have
come
with
my
mother
to
see
the
count
but
it
seems
he
is
not
well
.
yes
it
seems
he
is
ill
.
people
are
always
dis
turbing
him
answered
pierre
trying
to
re
member
who
this
young
man
was
.
boris
felt
that
pierre
did
not
recognize
him
but
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
introduce
himself
and
without
experiencing
the
least
em
barrassment
looked
pierre
straight
in
the
face
.
count
rostov
asks
you
to
come
to
dinner
today
said
he
after
a
considerable
pause
which
made
pierre
feel
uncomfortable
.
ah
count
rostov

exclaimed
pierre
joy
fully
.
then
you
are
his
son
ilydonly
fancy
didnt
know
you
at
first
.
do
you
remember
how
we
went
to
the
sparrow
hills
with
madame
jacquot

.

.

.
its
such
an
age

..
.
you
are
mistaken
said
boris
deliberately
with
a
bold
and
slightly
sarcastic
smile
.
i
am
boris
son
of
princess
anna
mikhylovna
dru

i
never

.
pierre
shook
his
head
and
arms
as
if
attacked
by
mosquitoes
or
bees
.
oh
dear
what
am
i
thinking
about
ive
mixed
every
thing
up
.
one
has
so
many
relatives
in
moscow
i
so
you
are
boris
of
course
.
well
now
we
know
where
we
are
.
and
what
do
you
think
of
the
boulogne
expedition
the
english
book
one
will
come
off
badly
you
know
if
napoleon
gets
across
the
channel
.
i
think
the
expedition
is
quite
feasible
.
if
only
villeneuve
doesnt
make
a
mess
of
things
boris
knew
nothing
about
the
boulogne
ex
pedition
he
did
not
read
the
papers
and
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
villeneuves
name
.
we
here
in
moscow
are
more
occupied
with
dinner
parties
and
scandal
than
with
politics
said
he
in
his
quiet
ironical
tone
.
i
know
noth
ing
about
it
and
have
not
thought
about
it
.
moscow
is
chiefly
busy
with
gossip
he
contin
ued
.
just
now
they
are
talking
about
you
and
your
father
.
pierre
smiled
in
his
goodnatured
way
as
if
afraid
for
his
companions
sake
that
the
latter
might
say
something
he
would
afterwards
re
gret
.
but
boris
spoke
distinctly
clearly
and
dry
ly
looking
straight
into
pierres
eyes
.
moscow
has
nothing
else
to
do
but
gossip
boris
went
on
.
everybody
is
wondering
to
whom
the
count
will
leave
his
fortune
though
he
may
perhaps
outlive
us
all
as
i
sincerely
hope
he
will

..
.
yes
it
is
all
very
horrid
interrupted
pierre
very
horrid
.
pierre
was
still
afraid
that
this
officer
might
inadvertently
say
something
disconcerting
to
himself
.
and
it
must
seem
to
you
said
boris
flush
ing
slightly
but
not
changing
his
tone
or
atti
tude
it
must
seem
to
you
that
everyone
is
try
ing
to
get
something
out
of
the
rich
man
so
it
does
thought
pierre
.
but
i
just
wish
to
say
to
avoid
misunder
standings
that
you
are
quite
mistaken
if
you
reckon
me
or
my
mother
among
such
people
.
we
are
very
poor
but
for
my
own
part
at
any
rate
for
the
very
reason
that
your
father
is
rich
i
dont
regard
myself
as
a
relation
of
his
and
neither
i
nor
my
mother
would
ever
ask
or
take
anything
from
him
.
for
a
long
time
pierre
could
not
understand
but
when
he
did
he
jumped
up
from
the
sofa
seized
boris
under
the
el
bow
in
his
quick
clum
sy
way
and
blushing
far
more
than
boris
be
gan
to
speak
with
a
feeling
of
mingled
shame
and
vexation
.
well
this
is
strange
do
you
suppose
i

..
.
who
could
think

..
.
i
know
very
well

.

.

.
but
boris
again
interrupted
him
.
i
am
glad
i
have
spoken
out
fully
.
perhaps
you
did
not
like
it
you
must
excuse
me
said
he
putting
pierre
at
ease
instead
of
being
put
at
ease
by
him
but
i
hope
i
have
not
offended
you
.
i
always
make
it
a
rule
to
speak
out
.

.

.

.
well
what
answer
am
i
to
take
will
you
come
to
dinner
at
the
rostrivs
and
boris
having
apparently
relieved
him
self
of
an
onerous
duty
and
extricated
himself
from
an
awkward
situation
and
placed
another
in
it
became
quite
pleasant
again
.
no
but
i
say
said
pierre
calming
down
you
are
a
wonderful
fellowl
what
you
have
just
said
is
good
very
good
.
of
course
you
dont
know
me
.
we
have
not
met
for
such
a
long
time

.

.

.
not
since
we
were
children
.
you
might
think
that
i

..
.
i
understand
quite
understand
.
i
could
not
have
done
it
myself
i
should
not
have
had
the
courage
but
its
splendid
.
i
am
very
glad
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
.
its
queer
he
added
a
f
ter
a
pause
that
you
should
have
suspected
me
he
began
to
laugh
.
well
what
of
it
i
hope
well
get
better
acquainted
and
he
pressed
boris
hand
.
do
you
know
i
have
not
once
been
in
to
see
the
count
.
he
has
not
sent
forme
i
am
sorry
for
him
as
a
man
but
what
can
one
do
and
so
you
think
napoleon
will
manage
to
get
an
army
across
asked
boris
with
a
smile
.
pierre
saw
that
boris
wished
to
change
the
subject
and
being
of
the
same
mind
he
began
explaining
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
boulogne
expedition
.
a
footman
came
in
to
summon
boris
the
princess
was
going
.
pierre
in
order
to
make
boris
better
acquaintance
promised
to
come
to
dinner
and
warmly
pressing
his
hand
looked
affectionately
over
his
spectacles
into
boris
eyes
.
after
he
had
gone
pierre
continued
pac
ing
up
and
down
the
room
for
a
long
time
no
longer
piercing
an
imaginary
foe
with
his
im
aginary
sword
but
smiling
at
the
remembrance
of
that
pleasant
intelligent
and
resoluteyoung
man
.
j
as
often
happens
in
early
youth
especially
to
one
who
leads
a
lonely
life
he
felt
an
unac
countable
tenderness
for
this
young
man
and
made
up
his
mind
that
they
would
be
friends
.
prince
vasili
saw
the
princess
off
.
she
held
a
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
her
face
was
tear
ful
.
it
is
dreadful
dreadful
she
was
saying
but
cost
me
what
it
may
i
shall
do
my
duty
.
i
will
come
and
spend
the
night
.
he
must
not
be
left
like
this
.
every
moment
is
precious
.
i
cant
think
why
his
nieces
put
it
off
.
perhaps
god
will
help
me
to
find
a
way
to
prepare
him
i

.

.

.
adieu
prince
may
god
support
you

.

.

.
adieu
ma
bonne
answered
prince
vasili
turning
away
from
her
.
oh
he
is
in
a
dreadful
state
said
the
moth
3
o
war
and
peace
er
to
her
son
when
they
were
in
the
carriage
.
he
hardly
recognizes
anybody
.
i
dont
understand
mamma
what
is
his
at
titude
to
pierre
asked
the
son
.
the
will
will
show
that
my
dear
our
fate
also
depends
on
it
.
but
why
do
you
expect
that
he
will
leave
us
anything
ah
my
dear
he
is
so
rich
and
we
are
so
poor
well
that
is
hardly
a
sufficient
reason
mamma

.

.

.
oh
heaven
how
ill
he
is
exclaimed
the
mother
.
chapter
xvii
after
anna
mikhaylovna
had
driven
off
with
her
son
to
visit
count
cyril
vladfmirovich
be
ziikhov
countess
rost6va
sat
for
a
long
time
all
alone
applying
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
.
at
last
she
rang
.
what
is
the
matter
with
you
my
dear
she
said
crossly
to
the
maid
who
kept
her
waiting
some
minutes
.
dont
you
wish
to
serve
me
then
ill
find
you
another
place
.
the
countess
was
upset
by
her
friends
sor
row
and
humiliating
poverty
and
was
there
fore
out
of
sorts
a
state
of
mind
which
with
her
always
found
expression
in
calling
her
maid
my
dear
and
speaking
to
her
with
exaggerat
ed
politeness
.
i
am
very
sorry
maam
answered
the
maid
.
ask
the
count
to
come
to
me
.
the
count
came
waddling
in
to
see
his
wife
with
a
rather
guilty
look
as
usual
.
well
little
countess
what
a
saute
of
game
au
madere
we
are
to
have
my
dear
i
tasted
it
.
the
thousand
rubles
i
paid
for
taras
were
not
illspent
.
he
is
worth
it
he
sat
down
by
his
wife
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
hands
ruffling
his
gray
hair
.
what
are
your
commands
little
countess
you

my
dear

.

.

.
whats

mess
she
said
pointing
to
his
waistcoat
.
its
the
saute
most
likely
she
added
with
a
smile
.
well
you
see
count
i
want
some
money
.
her
face
became
sad
.
oh
little
countess

.

.

.
and
the
count
be
gan
bustling
to
get
out
his
pocketbook
.
i
want
a
great
deal
count
i
want
five
hun
dred
rubles
and
taking
out
her
cambric
hand
kerchief
she
began
wiping
her
husbands
waist
coat
.
yes
immediately
immediately
hey
whos
there
he
called
out
in
a
tone
only
used
by
persons
who
are
certain
that
those
they
call
will
rvsh
to
obey
the
summons
.
send
dmitri
to
me
dmitri
a
man
of
good
family
who
had
been
brought
up
in
the
counts
house
and
now
man
aged
all
his
affairs
stepped
softly
into
the
room
.
this
is
what
i
want
my
dear
fellow
said
the
count
to
the
deferential
young
man
who
had
entered
.
bring
me

.

.

.
he
reflected
a
mo
ment
yes
bring
me
seven
hundred
rubles
yes
but
mind
dont
bring
me
such
tattered
and
dirty
notes
as
last
time
but
nice
clean
ones
for
the
countess
.
yes
dmitri
clean
ones

said
the
countess
sighing
deeply
.
when
would
you
like
them
your
excellen
cy
asked
dmitri
.
allow
me
to
inform
you

.

.

.
but
dont
be
uneasy
he
added
noticing
that
the
count
was
beginning
to
breathe
heav
ily
and
quickly
which
was
always
a
sign
of
ap
proaching
anger
.
i
was
forgetting

..
.
do
you
wish
it
brought
at
once
yes
yes
just
so
bring
it
.
give
it
to
the
countess
.
what
a
treasure
that
dmftri
is
added
the
count
with
a
smile
when
the
young
man
had
departed
.
there
is
never
any
impossible
with
him
.
thats
a
thing
i
hate
everything
is
possible
.
ah
money
count
money
how
much
sor
row
it
causes
in
the
world
said
the
countess
.
but
i
am
in
great
need
of
this
sum
.
you
my
little
countess
are
a
notorious
spendthrift
said
the
count
and
having
kissed
his
wifes
hand
he
went
back
to
his
study
.
when
anna
mikhaylovna
returned
from
count
bezukhovs
the
money
all
in
clean
notes
was
lying
ready
under
a
handkerchief
on
the
countess
little
table
and
anna
mikhaylovna
noticed
that
something
was
agitating
her
.
well
my
dear
asked
the
countess
.
oh
what
a
terrible
state
he
is
in
one
would
not
know
him
he
is
so
ill
i
was
only
there
a
few
moments
and
hardly
said
a
word

.

.

.
annette
for
heavens
sake
dont
refuse
me
the
countess
began
with
a
blush
that
looked
very
strange
on
her
thin
dignified
elderly
face
and
she
took
the
money
from
under
the
hand
kerchief
.
anna
mikhaylovna
instantly
guessed
her
in
tention
and
stooped
to
be
ready
to
embrace
the
countess
at
the
appropriate
moment
.
this
is
for
boris
from
me
for
his
outfit
.
anna
mikhdylovna
was
already
embracing
her
and
weeping
.
the
countess
wept
too
.
they
wept
because
they
were
friends
and
because
book
one
they
were
kindhearted
and
because
t
they
friends
from
childhood
had
to
think
about
such
a
base
thing
as
money
and
because
their
youth
was
over
.

.

.

.
but
those
tears
were
pleas
ant
to
them
both
.
chapter
xviii
countess
rostova
with
her
daughters
and
a
large
number
of
guests
was
already
seated
in
the
drawing
room
.
the
count
took
the
gentle
men
into
his
study
and
showed
them
his
choice
collection
of
turkish
pipes
.
from
time
to
time
he
went
out
to
ask
hasnt
she
come
yet
they
were
expecting
mdrya
dmf
trievna
akhro
simova
known
in
society
as
le
terrible
dragon
a
lady
distinguished
not
for
wealth
or
rank
but
for
common
sense
and
frank
plainness
of
speech
.
mdrya
dmitrievna
was
known
to
the
imperial
family
as
well
as
to
all
moscow
and
petersburg
and
both
cities
wondered
at
her
laughed
privately
at
her
rudenesses
and
told
good
stories
about
her
while
none
the
less
all
without
exception
respected
and
feared
her
.
in
the
counts
room
which
was
full
of
tobac
co
smoke
they
talked
of
the
war
that
had
been
announced
in
a
manifesto
and
about
the
re
cruiting
.
none
of
them
had
yet
seen
the
man
ifesto
but
they
all
knew
it
had
appeared
.
the
count
sat
on
the
sofa
between
two
guests
who
were
smoking
and
talking
.
he
neither
smoked
nor
talked
but
bending
his
head
first
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
watched
the
smok
ers
with
evident
pleasure
and
listened
to
the
conversation
of
his
two
neighbors
whom
he
egged
on
against
each
other
.
one
of
them
was
a
sallow
cleanshaven
ci
vilian
with
a
thin
and
wrinkled
face
already
growing
old
though
he
was
dressed
like
a
most
fashionable
young
man
.
he
sat
with
his
legs
up
on
the
sofa
as
if
quite
at
home
and
having
stuck
an
amber
mouthpiece
far
into
his
mouth
was
inhaling
the
smoke
spasmodically
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
.
this
was
an
old
bachelor
shinshfn
a
cousin
of
the
countess
a
man
with
a
sharp
tongue
as
they
said
in
moscow
soci
ety
.
he
seemed
to
be
condescending
to
his
com
panion
the
latter
a
fresh
rosy
officer
of
the
guards
irreproachably
washed
brushed
and
buttoned
held
his
pipe
in
the
middle
of
his
mouth
and
with
red
lips
gently
inhaled
the
smoke
letting
it
escape
from
his
handsome
mouth
in
rings
.
this
was
lieutenant
berg
an
officer
in
the
semenov
regiment
with
whom
borfs
was
to
travel
to
join
the
army
and
about
whom
natdsha
had
teased
her
elder
sister
ye
ra
speaking
of
berg
as
her
intended
.
the
count
sat
between
them
and
listened
attentively
.
his
favorite
occupation
when
not
playing
boston
a
card
game
he
was
very
fond
of
was
that
of
listener
especially
when
he
succeeded
in
set
ting
two
loquacious
talkers
at
one
another
.
well
then
old
chap
mon
tres
honorable
alphonse
kdrlovich
said
shinshfn
laughing
ironically
and
mixing
the
most
ordinary
rus
sian
expressions
with
the
choicest
french
phrases
which
was
a
peculiarity
of
his
speech
.

.
berg
always
spoke
quietly
politely
and
with
great
precision
.
his
conversation
always
re
lated
entirely
to
himself
he
would
remain
calm
and
silent
when
the
talk
related
to
any
topic
that
had
no
direct
bearingon
himself
.
he
could
remain
silent
for
hours
without
being
at
all
put
out
of
countenance
himself
or
making
others
uncomfortable
but
as
soon
as
the
conversa
tion
concerned
himself
he
would
begin
to
talk
circumstantially
and
with
evident
satisfaction
.
consider
my
position

nikoldevich
.

in
the
cavalry
i
should
get
not
more
than
two
hundred
rubles

with

of
lieutenant
but
as
it
is
i
receive
two
hundred

said
he
look
ing
at
shinshfn
and
the
count
with
a
joyful
pleasant
smile
as
if
it
were
obvious
to
him
that
his
success
must
always
be
the
chief
desire
of
everyone
else
.
besides
that

continued
berg
and

occur
much
more
frequently

then
just

what
can
be
done
with
two

to
put

aside

in

killed
and
he
as

in

might
easily
succeed
to
the

how
popular
he
was
with
everyone
in
the
regiment
and
how
satisfied
his

was
with
him
.
berg
evident
ly
enjoyed
narrating
all
this
and
did
not
seem
to
suspect
that
others
too
might
have
their
own
interests
.
but
all
he
said
was
so
prettily
se
date
and
the
naivete
of
his
youthful
egotism
was
so
obvious
that
he
disarmed
his
hearers
.

berg
smiled
joyously
.
the
count
followed
by
his
guests
went
into
the
drawing
room
.
it
was
just
the
moment
before
a
big
dinner
when
the
assembled
guests
expecting
the
sum
mons
to
zakuska
avoid
engaging
in
any
long
conversation
but
think
it
necessary
to
move
about
and
talk
in
order
to
show
that
they
are
not
at
all
impatient
for
their
food
.
the
host
and
hostess
look
toward
the
door
and
now
and
then
glance
at
one
another
and
the
visitors
try
to
guess
from
these
glances
who
or
what
they
are
waiting
for
some
important
relation
who
has
not
yet
arrived
or
a
dish
that
is
not
yet
ready
.
pierre
had
come
just
at
dinnertime
and
was
sitting
awkwardly
in
the
middle
of
the
drawing
room
on
the
first
chair
he
had
come
across
blocking
the
way
for
everyone
.
the
countess
tried
to
make
him
talk
but
he
went
on
naively
looking
around
through
his
spectacles
as
if
in
search
of
somebody
and
answered
all
her
ques
tions
in
monosyllables
.
he
was
in
the
way
and
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
notice
the
fact
.
most
of
the
guests
knowing
of
the
affair
with
the
bear
looked
with
curiosity
at
this
big
stout
quiet
man
wondering
how
such
a
clumsy
mod
est
fellow
could
have
played
such
a
prank
on
a
policeman
.
you
have
only
lately
arrived
the
countess
asked
him
.

replied
he
looking
around
him
.

understood
that
she

being
asked
to

this
young
man
and
sitting
down
beside

she
began
to
speak
about

up
in

the

settled
down
in

then
the

were
replaced
by
the
clatter
of

the
voices
of

and
the
soft

of

from

the

kept
glancing
at
his

her
tall

with

busily
filled

from

at

seemed
by
their
redness
to
contrast
more
than

with

at

an
even
chatter

was
heard
all
the

at

the
voices
sounded
loud
er
and
louder
especially
that
of
the
colonel
of
hussars
who
growing
more
and
more
flushed
ate
and
drank
so
much
that
the
count
held
him
up
as
a
pattern
to
the
other

ate

look
at

are
in

with

have
just
kissed
for

some
times
that

look
fell
on

and
that
funny
lively

look
made
him
inclined
to
laugh
without

strained
every
nerve
to
over
hear
what
nicholas

the
governess
kept
look
ing
round
uneasily
as
if
preparing
to
resent
any
slight
that
might
be
put
upon
the
children

the

trying

kinds
of

in

to
send
a
full
description
of

people

and
he
felt
greatly
offended
when
the
butler
with
a
bottle
wrapped
in
a
napkin
passed
him
by
.
he
frowned
trying
to
appear
as
if
he
did
not
want
any
of
that
wine
but
was
mortified
because
no
one
would
understand
that
it
was
not
to
quench
his
thirst
or
from
greediness
that
he
wanted
it
but
simply
from
a
conscientious
desire
for
knowledge
.

at
the

end
of
the
table
the
talk
grew
more
and
more
animated
.
the
colonel
told
them
that
the

of

had
already
appeared
in

the

leaving

reached
across

with
the

with

with

another
.
again
the

rushed
about

in

order
in

with

the

returned

the

holding
his

fanwise
kept
himself
with

from
dropping
into

and
laughed
at
every

the
young
people
at
the

in

gathered

natdsha

said
natisha

but
where

she
looked
round
and
seeing
that
her

was
not
in

ran
to
look
for
her
.
running
into
s6nyas
room
and
not
finding
her
there
natdsha
ran
to
the
nursery

yawas
not

either

natdsha
concluded
that
she
must
be
on
the
chest
in
the
passage
.
the
chest
in
the
passage
was
the
place
of
mourning
for

and
natashas
large
mouth
widened
making
her
look
quite
ugly
and
she
began
to
wail
like
a
baby
without
know
ing
why
except
that
s6nya
was
crying
.
sonya
tried
to
lift
her
head
to
answer
but
could
not
and
hid
her
face
still
deeper
in
the
bed
.

hugging
her

with
an
effort
s6nya
sat
up
and
began
wiping
her
eyes
and
explaining

and

upon

called

s6nya
could
not
continue
and
again
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
in
the
feather
bed
.
nata
sha
began
consoling
her
but
her
face
showed
that
she
understood
all
the
gravity
of
her
friends
trouble
.
s6nya
she
suddenly
exclaimed
as
if
she
had

natasha
what

.
and
again
she
began
to
sob
more
bitterly
than
before
.
natasha
lifted
her
up
hugged
her
and
smiling
through
her
tears
began
comfort
ing
her
.

natasha
kissed
her
on
the
hair
.
sonya
sat
up
.
the
little
kitten
brightened
its
eyes
shone
and
it
seemed
ready
to
lift
its
tail
jump
down
on
its
soft
paws
and
begin
playing
with
the
ball
of
worsted
as
a

.

said
quickly
smoothing

answered
natdsha
pushing
in
a
crisp
lock
that
had
strayed
from
under
her
friends
plaits
.
both
laughed
.

said
natdsha
stopping
suddenly
.
i
feel
so
happy
and
she
set
off
at
a
run
along
the
passage
.
s6nya
shaking
off
some
down
which
clung
to
her
and
tucking
away
the
verses
in
the
bos
om
of
her
dress
close
to
her
bony
little
chest
ran
after
natasha
down
the
passage
into
the
sitting
room
with
flushed
face
and
light
joy
ous
steps
.
at
the
visitors
request
the
young
people
sang
the
quartette
the
brook
with
which
everyone
was
delighted
.
then
nicholas
sang
a
song
he
had
just
learned
at
nighttime
in
the
moons
fair
glow
how
sweet
as
fancies
wander
free
f
to
feel
that
in
this
world
theres
one
who
still
is
thinking
but
of
thee
that
while
her
fingers
touch
the
harp
wafting
sweet
music
oer
the
lea
it
is
for
thee
thus
swells
her
heart
sighing
its
message
out
to
thee
.

.
a
day
or
two
then
bliss
unspoilt
but
oh
till
then
i
cannot
live

.
he
had
not
finished
the
last
verse
before
the
young
people
began
to
get
ready
to
dance
in
the
large
hall
and
the
sound
of
the
feet
and
the
coughing
of
the
musicians
were
heard
from
the
gallery
.
pierre
was
sitting
in
the
drawingroom
where
shinshin
had
engaged
him
as
a
man
recently
returned
from
abroad
in
a
political
conversa
tion
in
which
several
others
joined
but
which
bored
pierre
.
when
the
music
began
natasha
came
in
and
walking
straight
up
to
pierre
said
laughing
and
blushing
mamma
told
me
to
ask
you
to
join
the
dancers
.
i
am
afraid
of
mixing
the
figures
pierre
replied
but
if
you
will
be
my
teacher

.

.

.
and
lowering
his
big
arm
he
offered
it
to
the
slender
little
girl
.
while
the
couples
were
arranging
themselves
and
the
musicians
tuning
up
pierre
sat
down
with
his
little
partner
.
natasha
was
perfectly
happy
she
was
dancing
with
a
grownup
man
who
had
been
abroad
.
she
was
sitting
in
a
con
spicuous
place
and
talking
to
him
likeagrown
up
lady
.
she
had
a
fan
in
her
hand
that
one
of
the
ladies
had
given
her
to
hold
.
assuming
quite
the
pose
of
a
society
woman
heaven
knows
when
and
where
she
had
learned
it
she
talked
with
her
partner
fanning
herself
and
smiling
over
the
fan
.
dear
dear
just
look
at
her
exclaimed
the
countess
as
she
crossed
the
ballroom
pointing
to
natasha
.
book
one
natasha
blushed
and
laughed
.
well
really
mamma
why
should
you
what
is
there
to
be
surprised
at
in
the
midst
of
the
third
tcossaise
there
was
a
clatter
of
chairs
being
pushed
back
in
the
sitting
room
where
the
count
and
mdrya
dmi
trievna
had
been
playing
cards
with
the
major
ity
of
the
more
distinguished
and
older
visitors
.
they
now
stretching
themselves
after
sitting
so
long
and
replacing
their
purses
and
pocket
books
entered
the
ballroom
.
first
came
mdrya
dmitrievna
and
the
count
both
with
merry
countenances
.
the
count
with
playful
cere
mony
somewhat
in
ballet
style
offered
his
bent
arm
to
marya
dmitrievna
.
he
drew
himself
up
a
smile
of
debonair
gallantry
lit
up
his
face
and
as
soon
as
the
last
figure
of
the
ecos
saise
was
ended
he
clapped
his
hands
to
the
musicians
and
shouted
up
to
their
gallery
ad
dressing
the
first
violin

do
you
know
the
daniel

this
was
the
counts
favorite
dance
which
he
had
danced
in
his
youth

strictly
speak
ing
daniel
cooper
was
one
figure
of
the
anglaise
.
look
at
papa
shouted
natasha
to
the
whole
company
and
quite
forgetting
that
she
was
dancing
with
a
grownup
partner
she
bent
her
curly
head
to
her
knees
and
made
the
whole
room
ring
with
her
laughter
.
and
indeed
everybody
in
the
room
looked
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
at
the
jovial
old
gen
tleman
who
standing
beside
his
tall
and
stout
partner
mrya
dmftrievna
curved
his
arms
beat
time
straightened
his
shoulders
turned
out
his
toes
tapped
gently
with
his
foot
and
by
a
smile
that
broadened
his
round
face
more
and
more
prepared
the
onlookers
for
what
was
to
follow
.
as
soon
as
the
provocatively
gay
strains
of
daniel
cooper
somewhat
resem
bling
those
of
a
merry
peasant
dance
began
to
sound
all
the
doorways
of
the
ballroom
were
suddenly
filled
by
the
domestic
serfs
the
men
on
one
side
and
the
women
on
the
other
who
with
beaming
faces
had
come
to
see
their
master
making
merry
.
just
look
at
the
masterl
a
regular
eagle
he
is
loudly
remarked
the
nurse
as
she
stood
in
one
of
the
doorways
.
the
count
danced
well
and
knew
it
.
but
his
partner
could
not
and
did
not
want
to
dance
well
.
her
enormous
figure
stood
erect
her
pow
erful
arms
hanging
down
she
had
handed
her
reticule
to
the
countess
and
only
her
stern
but
handsome
face
really
joined
in
the
dance
.

of

plump
figure
in

found
ex

only
in

and
more
beaming

and

nose

but
if

get

and
more
into

charmed
the
spectators
by
the
unexpectedness
of
his
adroit
maneuvers
and
the
agility
with
which
he
capered
about
on

light
feet
mrya
dmi
trievna
produced
no

impression
by
slight
ex
ertions
the
least
effort
to
move
her
shoulders
or
bend
her
arms
when
turning
or
stamp
her
foot
which
everyone
appreciated
in
view
of
her
size
and
habitual
severity
.
the
dance
grew
livelier
and
livelier
.
the
other
couples
could
not
attract
a
moments
attention
to
their
own
evolutions
and
did
not
even
try
to
do
so
.
all
were
watching

and
mdrya

trievna
.
natasha
kept
pulling
everyone
by
sleeve
or
dress
urging
them
to
look
at
papa
though
as
it
was
they
never
took
their
eyes
off
the
couple
.
in
the
intervals
of
the

the

breathing

to
the

to

while
in
the

ballroom
the
sixth
ang
laise
was
being
danced
to
a
tune
in
which
the
weary

blundered
and

in

there
was
the

usual
at

outside

governor
of
moscow
who
war
and
peace
had
been
assiduous
in
sending
aidesdecamp
to
inquire
after
the
counts
health
came
him
self
that
evening
to
bid
a
last
farewell
to
the
celebrated
grandee
of
catherines
court
count
bezukhov
.
the
magnificent
reception
room
was
crowd
ed
.
everyone
stood
up
respectfully
when
the
military
governor
having
stayed
about
half
an
hour
alone
with
the
dying
man
passed
out
slightly
acknowledging
their
bows
and
trying
to
escape
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
glances
fixed
on
him
by
the
doctors
clergy
and
rela
tives
of
the
family
.
prince
vasfli
who
had
grown
thinner
and
paler
during
the
last
few
days
escorted
him
to
the
door
repeating
some
thing
to
him
several
times
in
low
tones
.
when
the
military
governor
had
gone
prince
vasfli
sat
down
all
alone
on
a
chair
in
the
ballroom
crossing
one
leg
high
over
the
other
leaning
his
elbow
on
his
knee
and
cover
ing
his
face
with
his
hand
.
after
sitting
so
for
a
while
he
rose
and
looking
about
him
with
frightened
eyes
went
with
unusually
hurried
steps
down
the
long
corridor
leading
to
the
back
of
the
house
to
the
room
of
the
eldest
princess
.
those
who
were
in
the
dimly
lit
reception
room
spoke
in
nervous
whispers
and
when
ever
anyone
went
into
or
came
from
the
dying
mans
room
grew
silent
and
gazed
with
eyes
full
of
curiosity
or
expectancy
at
his
door
which
creaked
slightly
when
opened
.
the
limits
of
human
life

.

.

.
are
fixed
and
may
not
be
oerpassed
said
an
old
priest
to
a
lady
who
had
taken
a
seat
beside
him
and
was
listening
naively
to
his
words
.
i
wonder
is
it
not
too
late
to
administer
unction
asked
the
lady
adding
the
priests
clerical
title
as
if
she
had
no
opinion
of
her
own
on
the
subject
.
ah
madam
it
is
a
great
sacrament
replied
the
priest
passing
his
hand
over
the
thin
griz
zled
strands
of
hair
combed
back
across
his
bald
head
.
who
was
that
the
military
governor
him
self
was
being
asked
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
how
younglooking
he
is
yes
and
he
is
over
sixty
.
i
hear
the
count
no
longer
recognizes
anyone
.
they
wished
to
administer
the
sacrament
of
unction
.
i
knew
someone
who
received
that
sacra
ment
seven
times
.
the
second
princess
had
just
come
from
the
sickroom
with
her
eyes
red
from
weeping
and
sat
down
beside
dr
.
lorrain
who
was
sitting
in
a
graceful
pose
under
a
portrait
of
cather
ine
leaning
his
elbow
on
a
table
.
beautiful
said
the
doctor
in
answer
to
a
remark
about
the
weather
.
the
weather
is
beautiful
princess
and
besides
in
moscow
one
feels
as
if
one
were
in
the
country
.
yes
indeed
replied
the
princess
with
a
sigh
.
so
he
may
have
something
to
drink
lorrain
considered
.
has
he
taken
his
medicine
yes
.
the
doctor
glanced
at
his
watch
.
take
a
glass
of
boiled
water
and
put
a
pinch
of
cream
of
tartar
and
he
indicated
with
his
delicate
fingers
what
he
meant
by
a
pinch
.
dere
has
neffer
been
a
gasea
german
doc
tor
was
saying
to
an
aidedecamp
dat
one
liffs
after
de
sird
sdroke
.
arid
what
a
wellpreserved
man
he
was
re
marked
the
aidedecamp
.
and
who
will
in
herit
his
wealth
he
added
in
a
whisper
.
it
vont
go
begging
replied
the
german
with
a
smile
.
everyone
again
looked
toward
the
door
which
creaked
as
the
second
princess
went
in
with
the
drink
she
had
prepared
according
to
lorrains
instructions
.
the
german
doctor
went
up
to
lorrain
.
do
you
think
he
can
last
till
morning
asked
the
german
addressing
lorrain
in
french
which
he
pronounced
badly
.
lorrain
pursing
up
his
lips
waved
a
severe
ly
negative
finger
before
his
nose
.
tonight
not
later
said
he
in
a
low
voice
and
he
moved
away
with
a
decorous
smile
of
selfsatisfaction
at
being
able
clearly
to
under
stand
and
state
the
patients
condition
.
meanwhile
prince
vasili
had
opened
the
door
into
the
princess
room
.
in
this
room
it
was
almost
dark
only
two
tiny
lamps
were
burning
before
the
icons
and
there
was
a
pleasant
scent
of
flowers
and
burnt
pastilles
.
the
room
was
crowded
with
small
pieces
of
furniture
whatnots
cupboards
and
little
tables
.
the
quilt
of
a
high
white
feather
bed
was
just
visible
behind
a
screen
.
a
small
dog
began
to
bark
.
ah
is
it
you
cousin
she
rose
and
smoothed
her
hair
which
was
as
usual
so
extremely
smooth
that
it
seemed
to
be
made
of
one
piece
with
her
head
and
cov
ered
with
varnish
.
has
anything
happened
she
asked
.
i
am
so
terrified
.
no
there
is
no
change
.
i
only
came
to
have
book
one
39
a
talk
about
business
catiche
l
muttered
the
prince
seating
himself
wearily
on
the
chair
she
had
just
vacated
.
you
have
made
the
place
warm
i
must
say
he
remarked
.
well
sit
down
lets
have
a
talk
.
i
thought
perhaps
something
had
hap
pened
she
said
with
her
unchanging
stonily
severe
expression
and
sitting
down
opposite
the
prince
she
prepared
to
listen
.
i
wished
to
get
a
nap
mon
cousin
but
i
cant
.
well
my
dear
said
prince
vasili
taking
her
hand
and
bending
it
downwards
as
was
his
habit
.
it
was
plain
that
this
well
referred
to
much
that
they
both
understood
without
nam
ing
.
the
princess
who
had
a
straight
rigid
body
abnormally
long
for
her
legs
looked
directly
at
prince
vasfli
with
no
sign
of
emotion
in
her
prominent
gray
eyes
.
then
she
shook
her
head
and
glanced
up
at
the
icons
with
a
sigh
.
this
might
have
been
taken
as
an
expression
of
sor
row
and
devotion
or
of
weariness
and
hope
of
resting
before
long
.
prince
vasili
understood
it
as
an
expression
of
weariness
.
and
i
he
said
do
you
think
it
is
easier
for
me
i
am
as
worn
out
as
a
post
horse
but
still
i
must
have
a
talk
with
you
catiche
a
very
serious
talk
.
prince
vasfli
said
no
more
and
his
cheeks
be
gan
to
twitch
nervously
now
on
one
side
now
on
the
other
giving
his
face
an
unpleasant
ex
pression
which
was
never
to
be
seen
on
it
in
a
drawing
room
.
his
eyes
too
seemed
strange
at
one
moment
they
looked
impudently
sly
and
at
the
next
glanced
round
in
alarm
.
the
princess
holding
her
little
dog
on
her
lap
with
her
thin
bony
hands
looked
atten
tively
into
prince
vasflis
eyes
evidently
re
solved
not
to
be
the
first
to
break
silence
if
she
had
to
wait
till
morning
.
well
you
see
my
dear
princess
and
cousin
catherine
semenovna
continued
prince
va
sfli
returning
to
his
theme
apparently
not
without
an
inner
struggle
at
such
a
moment
as
this
one
must
think
of
everything
.
one
must
think
of
the
future
of
all
of
you

..
.
i
love
you
all
like
children
of
my
own
as
you
know
.
the
princess
continued
to
look
at
him
with
out
moving
and
with
the
same
dull
expres
sion
.
and
then
of
course
my
family
has
also
to
be
considered
prince
vasili
went
on
testily
pushing
away
a
little
table
without
looking
at
1
catherine
.
her
.
you
know
catiche
that
wg
you
three
sisters
mdmontov
and
my
wife
are
the
counts
only
direct
heirs
.
i
know
i
know
how
hard
it
is
for
you
to
talk
or
think
of
such
matters
.
it
is
no
easier
for
me
but
my
dear
i
am
getting
on
for
sixty
and
must
be
prepared
for
anything
.
do
you
know
i
have
sent
for
pierre
the
count
pointing
to
his
portrait
definitely
demanded
that
he
should
be
called
.
prince
vasfli
looked
questioningly
at
the
princess
but
could
not
make
out
whether
she
was
considering
what
he
had
just
said
or
wheth
er
she
was
simply
looking
at
him
.
there
is
one
thing
i
constantly
pray
god
to
grant
mon
cousin
she
replied
and
it
is
that
he
would
be
merciful
to
him
and
would
allow
his
noble
soul
peacefully
to
leave
this
.

.

.
yes
yes
of
course
interrupted
prince
va
sili
impatiently
rubbing
his
bald
head
and
an
grily
pulling
back
toward
him
the
little
table
that
he
had
pushed
away
.
but

..
.
in
short
the
fact
is

..
.
you
know
yourself
that
last
win
ter
the
count
made
a
will
by
which
he
left
all
his
property
not
to
us
his
direct
heirs
but
to
pierre
.
he
has
made
wills
enoughl
quietly
re
marked
the
princess
.
but
he
cannot
leave
the
estate
to
pierre
.
pierre
is
illegitimate
.
but
my
dear
said
prince
vasfli
suddenly
clutching
the
little
table
and
becoming
more
animated
and
talking
more
rapidly
what
if
a
letter
has
been
written
to
the
emperor
in
which
the
count
asks
for
pierres
legitimation
do
you
understand
that
in
consideration
of
the
counts
services
his
request
would
be
granted

.

.

.
the
princess
smiled
as
people
do
who
think
they
know
more
about
the
subject
under
dis
cussion
than
those
they
are
talking
with
.
i
can
tell
you
more
continued
prince
va
sfli
seizing
her
hand
that
letter
was
written
though
it
was
not
sent
and
the
emperor
knew
of
it
.
the
only
question
is
has
it
been
de
stroyed
or
not
if
not
then
as
soon
as
all
is
over
and
prince
vasfli
sighed
to
intimate
what
he
meant
by
the
words
all
is
over
and
the
counts
papers
are
opened
the
will
and
letter
will
be
delivered
to
the
emperor
and
the
petition
will
certainly
be
granted
.
pierre
will
get
everything
as
the
legitimate
son
.
and
our
share
asked
the
princess
smiling
ironically
as
if
anything
might
happen
only
not
that
.
but
my
poor
catiche
it
is
as
clear
as
day
lightl
he
will
then
be
the
legal
heir
to
every
thing
and
you
wont
get
anything
.
you
must
war
and
peace
know
my
dear
whether
the
will
and
letter
were
written
and
whether
they
have
been
de
stroyed
or
not
.
and
if
they
have
somehow
been
overlooked
you
ought
to
know
where
they
are
and
must
find
them
because

.

.

.
what
next
the
princess
interrupted
smil
ing
sardonically
and
not
changing
the
expres
sion
of
her
eyes
.
i
am
a
woman
and
you
think
we
are
all
stupid
but
i
know
this
an
illegiti
mate
son
cannot
inherit

.

.

.
un
bdtard

she
added
as
if
supposing
that
this
translation
of
the
word
would
effectively
prove
to
prince
va
sfli
the
invalidity
of
his
contention
.
well
really
catiche
cant
you
under
stand
you
are
so
intelligent
how
is
it
you
dont
see
that
if
the
count
has
written
a
letter
to
the
emperor
begging
him
to
recognize
pierre
as
legitimate
it
follows
that
pierre
will
not
be
pierre
but
will
become
count
bezukhov
and
will
then
inherit
everything
under
the
will
and
if
the
will
and
letter
are
not
destroyed
then
you
will
have
nothing
but
the
consola
tion
of
having
been
dutiful
et
tout
ce
qui
s
en
suit

thats
certain
.
i
know
the
will
was
made
but
i
also
know
that
it
is
invalid
and
you
mon
cousin
seem
to
consider
me
a
perfect
fool
said
the
princess
with
the
expression
women
assume
when
they
suppose
they
are
saying
something
witty
and
stinging
.
my
dear
princess
catherine
semenovna
began
prince
vasfli
impatiently
i
came
here
not
to
wrangle
with
you
but
to
talk
about
your
interests
as
with
a
kinswoman
a
good
kind
true
relation
.
and
i
tell
you
for
the
tenth
time
that
if
the
letter
to
the
emperor
and
the
will
in
pierres
favor
are
among
the
counts
papers
then
my
dear
girl
you
and
your
sisters
are
not
heiressesl
if
you
dont
believe
me
then
believe
an
expert
.
i
have
just
been
talking
to
dmitri
oniifrich
the
family
solicitor
and
he
says
the
same
.
at
this
a
sudden
change
evidently
took
place
in
the
princess
ideas
her
thin
lips
grew
white
though
her
eyes
did
not
change
and
her
voice
when
she
began
to
speak
passed
through
such
transitions
as
she
herself
evidently
did
not
ex
pect
.
that
would
be
a
fine
thing
said
she
.
i
never
wanted
anything
and
i
dont
now
.
she
pushed
the
little
dog
off
her
lap
and
smoothed
her
dress
.
and
this
is
gratitudethis
is
recognition
for
those
who
have
sacrificed
everything
for
his
1
a
bastard
.

and
all
that
follows
therefrom
.
sake
she
cried
.
its
splendid
fine
i
dont
want
anything
prince
.
yes
but
you
are
not
the
only
one
.
there
are
your
sisters

.

.

.
replied
prince
vasfli
.
but
the
princess
did
not
listen
to
him
.
yes
i
knew
it
long
ago
but
had
forgotten
.
i
knew
that
i
could
expect
nothing
but
mean
ness
deceit
envy
intrigue
and
ingratitude
the
blackest
ingratitude
in
this
house

.

.

.
do
you
or
do
you
not
know
where
that
will
is
insisted
prince
vasfli
his
cheeks
twitching
more
than
ever
.
yes
i
was
a
fool
i
still
believed
in
people
loved
them
and
sacrificed
myself
.
but
only
the
base
the
vile
succeed
i
know
who
has
been
in
triguing
the
princess
wished
to
rise
but
the
prince
held
her
by
the
hand
.
she
had
the
air
of
one
who
has
suddenly
lost
faith
in
the
whole
hu
man
race
.
she
gave
her
companion
an
angry
glance
.
there
is
still
time
my
dear
.
you
must
re
member
catiche
that
it
was
all
done
casually
in
a
moment
of
anger
of
illness
and
was
after
wards
forgotten
.
our
duty
my
dear
is
to
recti
fy
his
mistake
to
ease
his
last
moments
by
not
letting
him
commit
this
injustice
and
not
to
let
him
die
feeling
that
he
is
rendering
un
happy
those
who

..
.
who
sacrificed
everything
for
him
chimed
in
the
princess
who
would
again
have
risen
had
not
the
prince
still
held
her
fast
though
he
never
could
appreciate
it
.
no
mon
cousin
she
added
with
a
sigh
i
shall
always
remem
ber
that
in
this
world
one
must
expect
no
re
ward
that
in
this
world
there
is
neither
honor
nor
justice
.
in
this
world
one
has
to
be
cun
ning
and
cruel
.
now
come
come
be
reasonable
.
i
know
your
excellent
heart
.
no
i
have
a
wicked
heart
.
i
know
your
heart
repeated
the
prince
.
i
value
your
friendship
and
wish
you
to
have
as
good
an
opinion
of
me
.
dont
upset
yourself
and
let
us
talk
sensibly
while
there
is
still
time
be
it
a
day
or
be
it
but
an
hour
tell
me
all
you
know
about
the
will
and
above
all
where
it
is
.
you
must
know
.
we
will
take
it
at
once
and
show
it
to
the
count
.
he
has
no
doubt
for
gotten
it
and
will
wish
to
destroy
it
.
you
un
derstand
that
my
sole
desire
is
conscientiously
to
carry
out
his
wishes
that
is
my
only
reason
for
being
here
.
i

simply
to
help

and

the
infamous
vile
woman
1
do
not
let
us
lose
any
time

.

.

.
ah
dont
talk
to
me
last
winter
she
whee
dled
herself
in
here
and
told
the
count
such
vile
disgraceful
things
about
us
especially
a
bout
sophie
i
cant
repeat
them
that
it
made
the
count
quite
ill
and
he
would
not
see
us
for
a
whole
fortnight
.
i
know
it
was
then
he
wrote
this
vile
infamous
paper
but
i
thought
the
thing
was
invalid
.
weve
got
to
it
at
last
why
did
you
not
tell
me
about
it
sooner
its
in
the
inlaid
portfolio
that
he
keeps
un
der
his
pillow
said
the
princess
ignoring
his
question
.
now
i
know
yes
if
i
have
a
sin
a
great
sin
it
is
hatred
of
that
vile
woman
al
most
shrieked
the
princess
now
quite
changed
.
and
what
docs
she
come
worming
herself
in
here
for
but
i
will
give
her
a
piece
of
my
mind
.
the
time
will
come
chapter
xxii
while
these
conversations
were
going
on
in
the
reception
room
and
the
princess
room
a
carriage
containing
pierre
who
had
been
sent
for
and
anna
mikhaylovna
who
found
it
nec
essary
to
accompany
him
was
driving
into
the
court
of
count
beziikhovs
house
.
as
the
wheels
rolled
softly
over
the
straw
beneath
the
win
dows
anna
mikhdylovna
having
turned
with
words
of
comfort
to
her
companion
realized
that
he
was
asleep
in
his
corner
and
woke
him
up
.
rousing
himself
pierre
followed
anna
mikhaylovna
out
of
the
carriage
and
only
then
began
to
think
of
the
interview
with
his
dying
father
which
awaited
him
.
he
noticed
that
they
had
not
come
to
the
front
entrance
but
to
the
backdoor
.
while
he
was
getting
down
from
the
carriage
steps
two
men
who
looked
like
tradespeople
ran
hurriedly
from
the
entrance
and
hid
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
.
pausing
for
a
moment
pierre
noticed
several
other
men
of
the
same
kind
hiding
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
on
both
sides
.
but
neither
anna
mik
haylovna
nor
the
footman
nor
the
coachman
who
could
not
help
seeing
these
people
took
any
notice
of
them
.
it
seems
to
be
all
right
pierre
concluded
and
followed
anna
mikhay
lovna
.
she
hurriedly
ascended
the
narrow
dim
ly
lit
stone
staircase
calling
to
pierre
who
was
lagging
behind
to
follow
.
though
he
did
not
see
why
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
go
to
the
count
at
all
still
less
why
he
had
to
go
by
the
back
stairs
yet
judging
byannamikhiylovnas
air
of
assurance
and
haste
pierre
concluded
that
it
was
all
absolutely
necessary
.
halfway
up
the
stairs
they
were
almost
knocked
over
by
some
men
who
carrying
pails
came
running
downstairs
their
boots
clattering
.
these
men
pressed
close
to
the
wall
to
let
pierre
andanna
mikmylovna
pass
and
did
not
evince
the
least
surprise
at
seeing
them
there
.
is
this
the
way
to
the
princesses
apart
ments
asked
anna
mikhaylovna
of
one
of
them
.
yes
replied
a
footman
in
a
bold
loud
voice
as
if
anything
were
now
permissible
the
door
to
the
left
maam
.
perhaps
the
count
did
not
ask
for
me
said
pierre
when
he
reached
the
landing
.
id
bet
ter
go
to
my
own
room
.
anna
mikhaylovna
paused
and
waited
for
him
to
come
up
.
ah
my
friend
she
said
touching
his
arm
as
she
had
done
her
sons
when
speaking
to
him
that
afternoon
believe
me
i
suffer
no
less
than
you
do
but
be
a
man
but
really
hadnt
i
better
go
away
he
asked
looking
kindly
at
her
over
his
spectacles
.
ah
my
dear
friend
forget
the
wrongs
that
may
have
been
done
you
.
think
that
he
is
your
father

.

.

.
perhaps
in
the
agony
of
death
.
she
sighed
.
i
have
loved
you
like
a
son
from
the
first
.
trust
yourself
to
me
pierre
.
i
shall
not
forget
your
interests
.
pierre
did
not
understand
a
word
but
the
conviction
that
all
this
had
to
be
grew
stronger
and
he
meekly
followed
anna
mikhaylovna
who
was
already
opening
a
door
.
this
door
led
into
a
back
anteroom
.
an
old
man
a
servant
of
the
princesses
sat
in
a
corner
knitting
a
stocking
.
pierre
had
never
been
in
this
part
of
the
house
and
did
not
even
know
of
the
existence
of
these
rooms
.
anna
mikhay
lovna
addressing
a
maid
who
was
hurrying
past
with
a
decanter
on
a
tray
as
my
dear
and
my
sweet
asked
about
the
princesses
health
and
then
led
pierre
along
a
stone
passage
.
the
first
door
on
the
left
led
into
the
princesses
apartments
.
the
maid
with
the
decanter
in
her
haste
had
not
closed
the
door
everything
in
the
house
was
done
in
haste
at
that
time
and
pierre
and
anna
mikhdylovna
in
passing
instinctively
glanced
into
the
room
where
prince
vasili
and
the
eldest
princess
were
sit
ting
close
together
talking
.
seeing
them
pass
prince
vasili
drew
back
with
obvious
impa
tience
while
the
princess
jumped
up
and
with
war
and
peace
a
gesture
of
desperation
slammed
the
door
with
all
her
might
.
this
action
was
so
unlike
her
usual
compo
sure
and
the
fear
depicted
on
prince
vasilis
face
so
out
of
keeping
with
his
dignity
that
pierre
stopped
and
glanced
inquiringly
over
his
spectacles
at
his
guide
.
anna
mikhdylovna
evinced
no
surprise
she
only
smiled
faintly
and
sighed
as
if
to
say
that
this
was
no
more
than
she
had
expected
.
be
a
man
my
friend
.
i
will
look
after
your
interests
said
she
in
reply
to
his
look
and
went
still
faster
along
the
passage
.
pierre
could
not
make
out
what
it
was
all
about
and
still
less
what
watching
over
his
interests
meant
but
he
decided
that
all
these
things
had
to
be
.
from
the
passage
they
went
into
a
large
dimly
lit
room
adjoining
the
counts
reception
room
.
it
was
one
of
those
sumptuous
but
cold
apartments
known
to
pierre
only
from
the
front
approach
but
even
in
this
room
there
now
stood
an
empty
bath
and
water
had
been
spilled
on
the
carpet
.
they
were
met
by
a
dea
con
with
a
censer
and
by
a
servant
who
passed
out
on
tiptoe
without
heeding
them
.
they
went
into
the
reception
room
familiar
to
pierre
with
two
italian
windows
opening
in
to
the
conservatory
with
its
large
bust
and
full
length
portrait
of
catherine
the
great
.
the
same
people
were
still
sitting
here
in
almost
the
same
positions
as
before
whispering
to
one
another
.
all
became
silent
and
turned
to
look
at
the
pale
tearworn
anna
mikhylovna
as
she
entered
and
at
the
big
stout
figure
of
pierre
who
hanging
his
head
meekly
followed
her
.
anna
mikhdylovnas
face
expressed
a
con
sciousness
that
the
decisive
moment
had
ar
rived
.
with
the
air
of
a
practical
petersburg
lady
she
now
keeping
pierre
close
beside
her
entered
the
room
even
more
boldly
than
that
afternoon
.
she
felt
that
as
she
brought
with
her
the
person
the
dying
man
wished
to
see
her
own
admission
was
assured
.
casting
a
rapid
glance
at
all
those
in
the
room
and
noticing
the
counts
confessor
there
she
glided
up
to
him
with
a
sort
of
amble
not
exactly
bowing
yet
seeming
to
grow
suddenly
smaller
and
re
spectfully
received
the
blessing
first
of
one
and
then
of
another
priest
.
god
be
thanked
that
you
are
in
time
said
she
to
one
of
the
priests
all
we
relatives
have
been
in
such
anxiety
.
this
young
man
is
the
counts
son
she
added
more
softly
.
what
a
terrible
moment
having
said
this
she
went
up
to
the
doctor
.
dear
doctor
said
she
this
young
man
is
the
counts
son
.
is
there
any
hope
the
doctor
cast
a
rapid
glance
upwards
and
silently
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
anna
mikhiy
lovna
with
just
the
same
movement
raised
her
shoulders
and
eyes
almost
closing
the
latter
sighed
and
moved
away
from
the
doctor
to
pierre
.
to
him
in
a
particularly
respectful
and
tenderly
sad
voice
she
said
trust
in
his
mercy
and
pointing
out
a
small
sofa
for
him
to
sit
and
wait
for
her
she
went
silently
toward
the
door
that
everyone
was
watching
and
it
creaked
very
slightly
as
she
disappeared
behind
it
.
pierre
having
made
up
his
mind
to
obey
his
monitress
implicitly
moved
toward
the
sofa
she
had
indicated
.
as
soon
as
anna
mikhdy
lovna
had
disappeared
he
noticed
that
the
eyes
of
all
in
the
room
turned
to
him
with
some
thing
more
than
curiosity
and
sympathy
.
he
noticed
that
they
whispered
to
one
another
casting
significant
looks
at
him
with
a
kind
of
awe
and
even
servility
.
a
deference
such
as
he
had
never
before
received
vas
shown
him
.
a
strange
lady
the
one
who
had
been
talking
to
the
priests
rose
and
offered
him
her
seat
an
aidedecamp
picked
up
and
returned
a
glove
pierre
had
dropped
the
doctors
became
re
spectfully
silent
as
he
passed
by
and
moved
to
make
way
for
him
.
at
first
pierre
wished
to
take
another
seat
so
as
not
to
trouble
the
lady
and
also
to
pick
up
the
glove
himself
and
to
pass
round
the
doctors
who
were
not
even
in
his
way
but
all
at
once
he
felt
that
this
would
not
do
and
that
tonight
he
was
a
person
o
bliged
to
perform
some
sort
of
awful
rite
which
everyone
expected
of
him
and
that
he
was
therefore
bound
to
accept
their
services
.
he
took
the
glove
in
silence
from
the
aidedecamp
and
sat
down
in
the
ladys
chair
placing
his
huge
hands
symmetrically
on
his
knees
in
the
naive
attitude
of
an
egyptian
statue
and
de
cided
in
his
own
mind
that
all
was
as
it
should
be
and
that
in
order
not
to
lose
his
head
and
do
foolish
things
he
must
not
act
on
his
own
ideas
tonight
but
must
yield
himself
up
entire
ly
to
the
will
of
those
who
were
guiding
him
.
not
two
minutes
had
passed
before
prince
vasili
with
head
erect
majestically
entered
the
room
.
he
was
wearing
his
long
coat
with
three
stars
on
his
breast
.
he
seemed
to
have
grown
thinner
since
the
morning
his
eyes
seemed
larger
than
usual
when
he
glanced
round
and
noticed
pierre
.
he
went
up
to
him
took
his
hand
a
thing
he
never
used
to
do
and
drew
it
downwards
as
if

to
ascertain

thought
it

to

pierres
mind
was
in
such
a
confused
state
that
the
word
stroke
suggested
to
him
a
blow
from
something
.
he
looked
at
prince
vasfli
in
perplexity
and
only
later
grasped
that
a
stroke
was
an
attack
of
illness
.
prince
vastti
said
some
thing
to

and
went
through
the
door
on
tiptoe
.
he
could
not
walk
well
on
tiptoe
and
his
whole
body
jerked
at
each
step
.
the
eldest
princess
followed
him
and
the
priests
and
deacons
and
some
servants
also
went
in
at
the
door
.
through
that

was
heard
a
noise

pierre
went
in
at
the
door
stepping
on
the
soft
carpet
and
noticed
that
the
strange
lady
the
aidedecamp
and
some
of
the
servants
all
followed
him
in
as
if
there
were
now
no
fur

pierre
well
knew
this
large
room
divided
by
columns
and
an

its

with

on

on

an
immense
case
containing
icons
was
brightly
illuminated
with
red
light
like
a
russian
church
during
evening
service
.
under
the
gleaming
icons
stood
a

and
in

on

by

with
that
gray
mane
of
hair
above
his
broad
forehead
which
reminded
one
of
a
lion
and
the
deep
characteristically
noble
wrinkles
of
his
handsome
ruddy
face
.
he
lay
just
under
the
icons
his
large
thick
hands
outside
the
quilt
.
into
the
right
hand
which
was
lying
palm
downwards
a
wax
taper
had
been
thrust
between
forefinger
and
thumb
and
an
old
serv
ant
bending
over
from
behind
the
chair
held
it
in
position
.
by
the
chair
stood
the
priests
their
long
hair
falling
over
their
magnificent
glittering
vestments
with
lighted
tapers
in
their
hands
slowly
and
solemnly
conducting
the
service
.
a
little
behind
them
stood
the
two
younger
princesses
holding
handkerchiefs
to
their
eyes
and
just
in

of
them
their

with

in

near
the

a

in

was
leaning
his
left
arm
on
the
carved
back
of
a
velvet
chair
he
had
turned
round
for
the
purpose
and
was
crossing
him
self
with
his
right
hand
turning
his
eyes
up
ward
each
time
he
touched
his
forehead
.
his
face
wore
a
calm
look
of
piety
and
resignation
to
the
will
of
god
.
if
you
do
not
understand
these
sentiments
he
seemed
to
be
saying
so
much
the

for
you
behind
him
stood
the
aidedecamp
the
doc
tors
and
the
menservants
the
men

had
separated
as
in

.
all
were
silently
crossing
themselves
and
the
reading
of
the
church
service
the
subdued
chanting
of
deep
bass
voices
and
in
the
intervals
sighs
and
the
shuffling
of
feet
were
the
only
sounds
that
could
be
heard
.
anna
mikhaylovna
with
an
air
of
importance
that
showed
that
she
felt
she
quite
knew
what
she
was
about
went
across
the
room
to
where
pierre
was
standing
and
gave
him
a
taper
.
he
lit
it
and
distracted
by
observing
those
around
him
began
crossing
himself
with
the
hand
that
held
the
taper
.
sophie
the
rosy
laughterloving
youngest
princess
with
the
mole
watched
him
.
she
smiled
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
remained
with
it
hidden
for
awhile
then
look
ing
up
and
seeing
pierre
she
again
began
to
laugh
.
she
evidently
felt
unable
to
look
at
him
without
laughing
but
could
not
resist
looking
at
him
so
to
be
out
of
temptation
she
slipped
quietly
behind
one
of
the
columns
.
in
the
midst
of
the
service
the
voices
of
the
priests
suddenly
ceased
they
whispered
to
one
another
and
the
old
servant
who
was
holding
the
counts
hand
got
up
and
said
something
to
the
ladies
.
anna
mikhaylovna
stepped
forward
and
stooping
o
ver
the
dying
man
beckoned
to
lorrain
from
behind
her
back
.
the
french
doctor
held
no
ta
per
he
was
leaning
against
one
of
the
columns
in
a
respectful
attitude
implying
that
he
a
foreigner
in
spite
of
all
differences
of
faith
44
understood
the
full
importance
of
the
rite
now
being
performed
and
even
approved
of
it
.
he
now
approached
the
sick
man
with
the
noise
less
step
of
one
in
full
vigor
of
life
with
his
delicate
white
fingers
raised
from
the
green
quilt
the
hand
that
was
free
and
turning
side
ways
felt
the
pulse
and
reflected
a
moment
.
the
sick
man
was
given
something
to
drink
there
was
a
stir
around
him
then
the
people
resumed
their
places
and
the
service
continued
.
during
this
interval
pierre
noticed
that
prince
vasili
left
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
leaning
and
with
an
air
which
intimated
that
he
knew
what
he
was
about
and
if
others
did
not
under
stand
him
it
was
so
much
the
worse
for
them
did
not
go
up
to
the
dying
man
but
passed
by
him
joined
the
eldest
princess
and
moved
with
her
to
the
side
of
the
room
where
stood
the
high
bedstead
with
its
silken
hangings
.
on
leaving
the
bed
both
prince
vasili
and
the
princess
passed
out
by
a
back
door
but
returned
to
their
places
one
after
the
other
before
the
service
was
concluded
.
pierre
paid
no
more
at
tention
to
thjs
occurrence
than
to
the
rest
of
what
went
on
having
made
up
his
mind
once
for
all
that
what
he
saw
happening
around
him
that
evening
was
in
some
way
essential
.
the
chanting
of
the
service
ceased
and
the
voice
of
the
priest
was
heard
respectfully
con
gratulating
the
dying
man
on
having
received
the
sacrament
.
the
dying
man
lay
as
lifeless
and
immovable
as
before
.
around
him
every
one
began
to
stir
steps
were
audible
and
whis
pers
among
which
anna
mikhaylovnas
was
the
most
distinct
.
pierre
heard
her
say
certainly
he
must
be
moved
onto
the
bed
here
it
will
be
impossible

.

.

.
the
sick
man
was
so
surrounded
by
doctors
princesses
and
servants
that
pierre
could
no
longer
see
the
reddishyellow
face
with
its
gray
mane
which
though
he
saw
other
faces
as
well
he
had
not
lost
sight
of
for
a
single
moment
during
the
whole
service
.
he
judged
by
the
cautious
movements
of
those
who
crowded
round
the
invalid
chair
that
they
had
lifted
the
dying
man
and
were
moving
him
.
catch
hold
of
my
arm
or
youll
drop
him
he
heard
one
of
the
servants
say
in
a
frightened
whisper
.
catch
hold
from
underneath
.
here
exclaimed
different
voices
and
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
bearers
and
the
shuffling
of
their
feet
grew
more
hurried
as
if
the
weight
they
were
carrying
were
too
much
for
them
.
as
the
bearers
among
whom
was
anna
mik
haylovna
passed
the
young
man
he
caught
a
war
and
peace
momentary
glimpse
between
their
heads
and
backs
of
the
dying
mans
high
stout
uncovered
chest
and
powerful
shoulders
raised
by
those
who
were
holding
him
under
the
armpits
and
of
his
gray
curly
leonine
head
.
this
head
with
its
remarkably
broad
brow
and
cheekbones
its
handsome
sensual
mouth
and
its
cold
majes
tic
expression
was
not
disfigured
by
the
ap
proach
of
death
.
it
was
the
same
as
pierre
re
membered
it
three
months
before
when
the
count
had
sent
him
to
petersburg
.
but
now
this
head
was
swaying
helplessly
with
the
uneven
movements
of
the
bearers
and
the
cold
listless
gaze
fixed
itself
upon
nothing
.
after
a
few
minutes
bustle
beside
the
high
bedstead
those
who
had
carried
the
sick
man
dispersed
.
anna
mikhaylovna
touched
pierres
hand
and
said
come
.
pierre
went
with
her
to
the
bed
on
which
the
sick
man
had
been
laid
in
a
stately
pose
in
keeping
with
the
ceremony
just
completed
.
he
lay
with
his
head
propped
high
on
the
pillows
.
his
hands
were
symmetri
cally
placed
on
the
green
silk
quilt
the
palms
downward
.
when
pierre
came
up
the
count
was
gazing
straight
at
him
but
with
a
look
the
significance
of
which
could
not
be
understood
by
mortal
man
.
either
this
look
meant
nothing
but
that
as
long
as
one
has
eyes
they
must
look
somewhere
or
it
meant
too
much
.
pierre
hesi
tated
not
knowing
what
to
do
and
glanced
in
quiringly
at
his
guide
.
anna
mikhdylovna
made
a
hurried
sign
with
her
eyes
glancing
at
the
sick
mans
hand
and
moving
her
lips
as
if
to
send
it
a
kiss
.
pierre
carefully
stretching
his
neck
so
as
not
to
touch
the
quilt
followed
her
suggestion
and
pressed
his
lips
to
the
large
boned
fleshy
hand
.
neither
the
hand
nor
a
single
muscle
of
the
counts
face
stirred
.
once
more
pierre
looked
questioningly
at
anna
mikhaylovna
to
see
what
he
was
to
do
next
.
anna
mikhaylovna
with
her
eyes
indicated
a
chair
that
stood
beside
the
bed
.
pierre
obedi
ently
sat
down
his
eyes
asking
if
he
were
doing
right
.
anna
mikhaylovna
nodded
approving
ly
.
again
pierre
fell
into
the
naively
symmetri
cal
pose
of
an
egyptian
statue
evidently
dis
tressed
that
his
stout
and
clumsy
body
took
up
so
much
room
and
doing
his
utmost
to
look
as
small
as
possible
.
he
looked
at
the
count
who
still
gazed
at
the
spot
where
pierres
face
had
been
before
he
sat
down
.
anna
mikhaylovna
indicated
by
her
attitude
her
consciousness
of
the
pathetic
importance
of
these
last
moments
of
meeting
between
the
father
and
son
.
this
lasted
about
two
minutes
which
to
pierre
seemed
an
hour
.
suddenly
the
broad
muscles
book
one
45
and
lines
of
the
counts
face
began
to
twitch
.
the
twitching
increased
the
handsome
skouth
was
drawn
to
one
side
only
now
did
pierre
realize
how
near
death
his
father
was
and
from
that
distorted
mouth
issued
an
indistinct
hoarse
sound
.
anna
mikhaylovna
looked
at
tentively
at
the
sick
mans
eyes
trying
to
guess
what
he
wanted
she
pointed
first
to
pierre
then
to
some
drink
then
named
prince
vasfli
in
an
inquiring
whisper
then
pointed
to
the
quilt
.
the
eyes
and
face
of
the
sick
man
showed
im
patience
.
he
made
an
effort
to
look
at
the
serv
ant
who
stood
constantly
at
the
head
of
the
bed
.
wants
to
turn
on
the
other
side
whis
pered
the
servant
and
got
up
to
turn
the
counts
heavy
body
toward
the
wall
.
pierre
rose
to
help
him
.
while
the
count
was
being
turned
over
one
of
his
arms
fell
back
helplessly
and
he
made
a
fruitless
effort
to
pull
it
forward
.
whether
he
noticed
the
look
of
terror
with
which
pierre
re
garded
that
lifeless
arm
or
whether
some
other
thought
flitted
across
his
dying
brain
at
any
rate
he
glanced
at
the
refractory
arm
at
pierres
terrorstricken
face
and
again
at
the
arm
and
on
his
face
a
feeble
piteous
smile
appeared
quite
out
of
keeping
with
his
features
that
seemed
to
deride
his
own
helplessness
.
at
sight
of
this
smile
pierre
felt
an
unexpected
quiver
ing
in
his
breast
and
a
tickling
in
his
nose
and
tears
dimmed
his
eyes
.
the
sick
man
was
turned
onto
his
side
with
his
face
to
the
wall
.
he
sighed
.
he
is
dozing
said
anna
mikhaylovna
ob
serving
that
one
of
the
princesses
was
coming
to
take
her
turn
at
watching
.
let
us
go
.
pierre
went
out
.
chapter
xxiv
there
was
now
no
one
in
the
reception
room
except
prince
vasfli
and
the
eldest
prin
cess
who
were
sitting
under
the
portrait
of
catherine
the
great
and
talking
eagerly
.
as
soon
as
they
saw
pierre
and
his
companion
they
became
silent
and
pierre
thought
he
saw
the
princess
hide
something
as
she
whispered
i
cant
bear
the
sight
of
that
woman
.
catiche
has
had
tea
served
in
the
small
draw
ing
room
said
prince
vasili
to
anna
mikhay
lovna
.
go
and
take
something
my
poor
anna
mikhdylovna
or
you
will
not
hold
out
.
to
pierre
he
said
nothing
merely
giving
his
arm
a
sympathetic
squeeze
below
the
shoulder
.
pierre
went
with
anna
mikhdylovna
into
the
small
drawing
room
.
there
is
nothing
so
refreshing
after
a
sleep
less
night
as
a
cup
of
this
delicious
russian
tea
lorrain
was
say
ing
with
an
air
of
restrained
an
imation
as
he
stood
sipping
tea
from
a
delicate
chinese
handleless
cup
before
a
table
on
which
tea
and
a
cold
supper
were
laid
in
the
small
circular
room
.
around
the
table
all
who
were
at
count
bezukhovs
house
that
night
had
gath
ered
to
fortify
themselves
.
pierre
well
remem
bered
this
small
circular
drawing
room
with
its
mirrors
and
little
tables
.
during
balls
given
at
the
house
pierre
who
did
not
know
how
to
dance
had
liked
sitting
in
this
room
to
watch
the
ladies
who
as
they
passed
through
in
their
ball
dresses
with
diamonds
and
pearls
on
their
bare
shoulders
looked
at
themselves
in
the
brilliantly
lighted
mirrors
which
repeated
their
reflections
several
times
.
now
this
same
room
was
dimly
lighted
by
two
candles
.
on
one
small
table
tea
things
and
supper
dishes
stood
in
dis
order
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
motley
throng
of
people
sat
there
not
merrymaking
but
somberly
whispering
and
betraying
by
ev
ery
word
and
movement
that
they
none
of
them
forgot
what
was
happening
and
what
was
about
to
happen
in
the
bedroom
.
pierre
did
not
eat
anything
though
he
would
very
much
have
liked
to
.
he
looked
inquiringly
at
his
moni
tressand
saw
that
she
was
again
going
on
tiptoe
to
the
reception
room
where
they
had
left
prince
vasfli
and
the
eldest
princess
.
pierre
concluded
that
this
also
was
essential
and
after
a
short
interval
followed
her
.
anna
mikhdylov
na
was
standing
beside
the
princess
and
they
were
both
speaking
in
excited
whispers
.
permit
me
princess
to
know
what
is
neces
sary
and
what
is
not
necessary
said
the
young
er
of
the
two
speakers
evidently
in
the
same
state
of
excitement
as
when
she
had
slammed
the
door
of
her
room
.
but
my
dear
princess
answered
anna
mikhaylovna
blandly
but
impressively
block
ing
the
way
to
the
bedroom
and
preventing
the
other
from
passing
wont
this
be
too
much
for
poor
uncle
at
a
moment
when
he
needs
re
pose
worldly
conversation
at
a
moment
when
his
soul
is
already
prepared

.

.

.
prince
vasfli
was
seated
in
an
easy
chair
in
his
familiar
attitude
with
one
leg
crossed
high
above
the
other
.
his
cheeks
which
were
so
flab
by
that
they
looked
heavier
below
were
twitch
ing
violently
but
he
wore
the
air
of
a
man
lit
tle
concerned
in
what
the
two
ladies
were
say
ing
.
come
my
dear
anna
mikhdylovna
let
ca
tiche
do
as
she
pleases
.
you
know
how
fond
the
count
is
of
her
.
war
and
peace
i
dont
even
know
what
is
in
this
paper
said
the
younger
of
the
two
ladies
addressing
prince
vasili
and
pointing
to
an
inlaid
port
folio
she
held
in
her
hand
.
all
i
know
is
that
his
real
will
is
in
his
writing
table
and
this
is
a
paper
he
has
forgotten
.

.

.

.
she
tried
to
pass
anna
mikhdylovna
but
the
latter
sprang
so
as
to
bar
her
path
.
i
know
my
dear
kind
princess
said
anna
mikhdylovna
seizing
the
portfolio
so
firmly
that
it
was
plain
she
would
not
let
go
easily
.
dear
princess
i
beg
and
implore
you
have
some
pity
on
him
e
vous
en
conjure

.

.

the
princess
did
not
reply
.
their
efforts
in
the
struggle
for
the
portfolio
were
the
only
sounds
audible
but
it
was
evident
that
if
the
princess
did
speak
her
words
would
not
be
flattering
to
anna
mikhdylovna
.
though
the
latter
held
on
tenaciously
her
voice
lost
none
of
its
honeyed
firmness
and
softness
.
pierre
my
dear
come
here
.
i
think
he
will
not
be
out
of
place
in
a
family
consultation
is
l
it
not
so
prince
why
dont
you
speak
cousin
suddenly
shrieked
the
princess
so
loud
that
those
in
the
drawing
room
heard
her
and
were
startled
.
why
do
you
remain
silent
when
heaven
knows
who
permits
herself
to
interfere
mak
ing
a
scene
on
the
very
threshold
of
a
dying
mans
room
intriguer
she
hissed
viciously
and
tugged
with
all
her
might
at
the
portfolio
.
but
anna
mikhdylovna
went
forward
a
step
or
two
to
keep
her
hold
on
the
portfolio
and
changed
her
grip
.
prince
vasili
rose
.
oh
said
he
with
re
proach
and
surprise
this
is
absurd
come
let
go
i
tell
you
.
the
princess
let
go
.
and
you
too
but
anna
mikhdylovna
did
not
obey
him
.
let
go
i
tell
you
i
will
take
the
responsi
bility

i
myself
will

and

does
that
satisfy
you
but
prince
said
anna
mikhdylovna
aft
er
such
a
solemn
sacrament
allow
him
a
mo
ments
peace
here
pierre
tell
them
your
opinion
said
she
turning
to
the
young
man
who
having
come
quite
close
was
gazing
with
astonishment
at
the
angry
face
of
the
princess
which
had
lost
all
dignity
and
at
the
twitch
ing
cheeks
of
prince
vasili
.
remember
that
you
will
answer
for
the
con
sequences
said
prince
vasili
severely
.
you
dont
know
what
you
are
doing
.
vile
woman
shouted
the
princess
dart
ing
unexpectedly
at
anna
mikhdylovna
and
snatching
the
portfolio
from
her
.
priice
vasili
bent
his
head
and
spread
out
his
hands
.
at
this
moment
that
terrible
door
which
pierre
had
watched
so
long
and
which
had
al
ways
opened
so
quietly
burst
noisily
open
and
banged
against
the
wall
and
the
second
of
the
three
sisters
rushed
out
wringing
her
hands
.
what
are
you
doing
she
cried
vehemently
.
he
isdyingand
you
leave
me
alone
with
him
her
sister
dropped
the
portfolio
.
anna
mik
hdylovna
stooping
quickly
caught
up
the
ob
ject
of
contention
and
ran
into
the
bedroom
.
the
eldest
princess
and
prince
vasfli
recover
ing
themselves
followed
her
a
few
minutes
lat
er
the
eldest
sister
came
out
with
a
pale
hard
face
again
biting
her
underlip
.
at
sight
of
pierre
her
expression
showed
an
irrepressible
hatred
.
yes
now
you
may
be
glad
said
she
this
is
what
you
have
been
waiting
for
.
and
burst
ing
into
tears
she
hid
her
face
in
her
handker
chief
and
rushed
from
the
room
.
prince
vasili
came
next
.
he
staggered
to
the
sofa
on
which
pierre
was
sitting
and
dropped
onto
it
covering
his
face
with
his
hand
.
pierre
noticed
that
he
was
pale
and
that
his
jaw
quiv
ered
and
shook
as
if
in
an
ague
.
ah
my
friend
said
he
taking
pierre
by
the
elbow
and
there
was
in
his
voice
a
sincer
ity
and
weakness
pierre
had
never
observed
in
it
before
.
how
often
we
sin
how
much
we
deceive
and
all
for
what
i
am
near
sixty
dear
friend

..
.
i
too

.

.

.
all
will
end
in
death
all
death
is
awful

.

.

.
and
he
burst
into
tears
.
anna
mikhdylovna
came
out
last
.
she
ap
proached
pierre
with
slow
quiet
steps

said

pierre
gave
her
an
inquiring
look
.
she
kissed
the
young
man
on
his
forehead
wetting
him
with
her
tears
.
then
after
a
pause
she
said
he
is
no
more

pierre
looked
at
her
over
his
spectacles
.
come
i
will
go
with
you

such
relief
as

she
led
him
into
the
dark
drawing
room
and
pierre
was
glad
no
one
could
see
his
face
.
anna
mikhdylovna
left
him
and
when
she
re
turned
he
was
fast
asleep
with
his
head
on
his
arm
.
in
the
morning
anna
mikhdylovna
said
to
pierre
yes
my
dear
this
is
a
great
loss
for
us
all
not
to
speak
of
you
.
but
god
will
support
you
you
are
young
and
are
now
i
hope
in
com

of
an
immense
fortune

i

enough
to
be
sure
that
this
will
not
turn
your
head
out
it
imposes
duties
on
you
and
you
must
be
a
man
.
pierre
was
silent
.
perhaps
later
on
i
may
tell
you
my
dear
boy
that
if
i
had
not
been
there
god
only
knows
what
would
have
happened

you
know
uncle
promised
me
only
the
day
before
yes

not
to
forget
boris
.
but
he
had
no
time
.
i
hope
my
dear
friend
you
will
carry
out
your
fathers
wish
pierre
understood
nothing
of
all
this
and
coloring
shyly
looked
in
silence
at
princess
an
na
mikhaylovna
.
after
her
talk
with
pierre
anna
mikhaylovna
returned
to
the
rost6vs
and
went
to
bed
.
on
waking
in
the
morning
she
told
the
rostovs
and
all
her
acquaintances
the
details
of
count
bezukhovs
death
.
she
said
the
count
had
died
as
she
would
herself
wish
to
die
that
his
end
was
not
only
touching
but
edify
ing
.
as
to
the
last
meeting
between
father
and
son
it
was
so
touching
that
she
could
not
think
of
it
without
tears
and
did
not
know
which
had
behaved
better
during
those
awful
mo
mentsthe
father
who
so
remembered
every
thing
and
everybody
at
the
last
and
had
spoken
such
pathetic
words
to
the
son
or
pierre
whom
it
had
been
pitiful
to
see
so
stricken
was
he
with
grief
though
he
tried
hard
to
hide
it
in
or
der
not
to
sadden
his
dying
father
.
it
is
pain
ful
but
it
does
one
good
.
it
uplifts
the
soul
to
see
such
men
as
the
old
count
and
his
worthy
son
said
she
.
of
the
behavior
of
the
eldest
princess
and
prince
vasili
she
spoke
disapprov

but
in
whispers

as
a
great
secret

estate
the
arrival
of
young
prince
andrew
and
his
wife
was
daily
expected
but
this
expectation
did
not
upset
the
regular
rou
tine
of
life
in
the
old
princes
household
.
gen
eral
in
chief
prince
nicholas
andreevich
nicknamed
in
society
the
king
of
prussia
ever
since
the
emperor
paul
had
exiled
him
to
his
country
estate
had
lived
there
continuously
with
his
daughter
princess
mary
and
her
com
panion
mademoiselle
bourienne
.
though
in
the
new
reign
he
was
free
to
return
to
the
capi
tals
he
still
continued
to
live
in
the
country
remarking
that
anyone
who
wanted
to
see
him
could
come
the
hundred
miles
from
moscow
to
bald
hills
while
he
himself
needed
no
one
and
nothing
.
he
used
to
say
that
there
are
only
two
sources
of
human
vice
idleness
and
supersti
tion
and
only
two
virtues
activity
and
intel
ligence
.
he
himself
undertook
his
daughters
education
and
to
develop
these
two
cardinal
virtues
in
her
gave
her
lessons
in
algebra
and
geometry
till
she
was
twenty
and
arranged
her
life
so
that
her
whole
time
was
occupied
.
he
was
himself
always
occupied
writing
his
mem
oirs
solving
problems
in
higher
mathematics
turning
snuffboxes
on
a
lathe
working
in
the
garden
or
superintending
the
building
that
was
always
going
on
at
his
estate
.
as
regular
ity
is
a
prime
condition
facilitating
activity
regularity
in
his
household
was
carried
to
the
highest
point
of
exactitude
.
he
always
came
to
table
under
precisely
the
same
conditions
and
not
only
at
the
same
hour
but
at
the
same
min
ute
.
with
those
about
him
from
his
daughter
to
his
serfs
the
prince
was
sharp
and
invariably
exacting
so
that
without
being
a
hardhearted
man
he
inspired
such
fear
and
respect
as
few
hardhearted
men
would
have
aroused
.
al
though
he
was
in
retirement
and
had
now
no
influence
in
political
affairs
every
high
official
appointed
to
the
province
in
which
the
princes
estate
lay
considered
it
his
duty
to
visit
him
and
waited
in
the
lofty
antechamber
just
as
the
ar
chitect
gardener
or
princess
mary
did
till
the
prince
appeared
punctually
to
the
appointed
hour
.
everyone
sitting
in
this
antechamber
ex
perienced
the
same
feeling
of
respect
and
even
fear
when
the
enormously
high
study
door
opened
and
showed
the
figure
of
a
rather
small
old
man
with
powdered
wig
small
withered
hands
and
bushy
gray
eyebrows
which
when
he
frowned
sometimes
hid
the
gleam
of
his
shrewd
youthfully
glittering
eyes
.
on
the
morning
of
the
day
that
the
young
couple
were
to
arrive
princess
mary
entered
the
antechamber
as
usual
at
the
time
appoint
ed
for
the
morning
greeting
crossing
herself
with
trepidation
and
repeating
a
silent
prayer
.
every
morning
she
came
in
like
that
and
ev
ery
morning
she
prayed
that
the
daily
interview
might
pass
off
well
.
an
old
powdered
manservant
who
was
sit
ting
in
the
antechamber
rose
quietly
and
said
in
a
whisper
please
walk
in
.
through
the
door
came
the
regular
hum
of
a
lathe
.
the
princess
timidly
opened
the
door
which
moved
noiselessly
and
easily
.
she
paused
at
the
entrance
.
the
prince
was
working
at
the
lathe
and
after
glancing
round
continued
his
work
.
the
enormous
study
was
full
of
things
evi
dently
in
constant
use
.
the
large
table
covered
with
books
and
plans
the
tall
glassfronted
bookcases
with
keys
in
the
locks

high
desk

war
and
peace
for
writing
while
standing
up
on
which
lay
an
open
exercise
book
and
the
lathe
with
tools
laid
ready
to
hand
and
shavings
scattered
aroundall
indicated
continuous
varied
and
orderly
activity
.
the
motion
of
the
small
foot
shod
in
a
tartar
boot
embroidered
with
silver
and
the
firm
pressure
of
the
lean
sinewy
hand
showed
that
the
prince
still
possessed
the
tena
cious
endurance
and
vigor
of
hardy
old
age
.
after
a
few
more
turns
of
the
lathe
he
removed
his
foot
from
the
pedal
wiped
his
chisel
dropped
it
into
a
leather
pouch
attached
to
the
lathe
and
approaching
the
table
summoned
his
daughter
.
he
never
gave
his
children
a
bless
ing
so
he
simply
held
out
his
bristly
cheek
as
yet
unshaven
and
regarding
her
tenderly
and
attentively
said
severely
quite
well
all
right
then
sit
down
.
he
took
the
exercise
book
containing
lessons
in
geometry
written
by
himself
and
drew
up
a
chair
with
his
foot
.
for
tomorrow
said
he
quickly
finding
the
page
and
making
a
scratch
from
one
para
graph
to
another
with
his
hard
nail
.
the
princess
bent
over
the
exercise
book
on
the
table
.
wait
a
bit
heres
a
letter
for
you
said
the
old
man
suddenly
taking
a
letter
addressed
in
a
womans
hand
from
a
bag
hanging
above
the
table
onto
which
he
threw
it
.
at
the
sight
of
the
letter
red
patches
showed
themselves
on
the
princess
face
.
she
took
it
quickly
and
bent
her
head
over
it
.
from
hloise
asked
the
prince
with
a
cold
smile
that
showed
hisstill
sound
yellowish
teeth
.

yes
its
from
julie
replied
the
princess
with
a
timid
glance
and
a
timid
smile
.
ill
let
two
more
letters
pass
but
the
third
ill
read
said
the
prince
sternly
im
afraid
you
write
much
nonsense
.
ill
read
the
third
i
read
this
if
you

said
the
prin

blushing
still
more
and
holding
out
the
letter

cried
theprince
abruptly
pushing
the
letter
away
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
table
he
drew
toward
him
the
exercise
book
containing
geometrical
fig
ures
.
well
madam
he
began
stooping
over
the
book
close
to
his
daughter
and
placing
an
arm
on
the
back
of
the
chair
on
which
she
sat
so

the
prince
is

to

that
she
felt
herself
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
skrid
scent
of
old
age
and

which
she
had
known
so
long
.

the
princess
looked
in
a
scared
way
at
her
fathers
eyes
glittering
close
to
her
the
red
patches
on
her
face
came
and
went
and
it
was
plain
that
she
understood
nothing
and
was
so
frightened
that
her
fear
would
prevent
her
un
derstanding
any
of
her
fathers
further
explana
tions
however
clear
they
might
be
.
whether
it
was
the
teachers
fault
or
the
pupils
this
same
thing
happened
every
day
the
princess
eyes
grew
dim
she
could
not
see
and
could
not
hear
anything
but
was
only
conscious
of
her
stern
fathers
withered
face
close
to
her
of
his
breath
and
the
smell
of
him
and
could
think
only
of
how
to
get
away
quickly
to
her
own
room
to
make
out
the
problem
in
peace
.
the
old
man
was
beside
himself
moved
the
chair
on
which
he
was
sitting
noisily
backward
and
forward
made
efforts
to
control
himself
and
not
become
vehement
but
almost
always
did
become
ve
hement
scolded
and
sometimes
flung
the
ex
ercise
book
away
.
the
princess
gave
a
wrong
answer
.
well
now
isnt
she
a
fool
shouted
the
prince
pushing
the
book
aside
and
turning
sharply
away
but
rising
immediately
he
paced
up
and
down
lightly
touched
his
daughters
hair
and
sat
down
again
.
he
drew
up
his
chair
and
continued
to
ex
plain
.
this
wont
do

he
when
princess

having
taken
and
closed

and
he
patted
her
cheek
.
it
will
drive
all
the
nonsense
out
of
your
head
.
she
turned
to
go
but
he
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
and
took
an
uncut
book
from
the
high
desk
.

of

he
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
and
himself
closed
the
door
after
her
.
princess
mary
went
back
to
her
room
with
the
sad
scared
expression
that
rarely
left
her
and
which
made
her
plain
sickly
face
yet
plain
er
.
she
sat
down
at
her
writing
table
on
which
stood
miniature
portraits
and
which
was
lit
book
tered
with
books
and
papers
.
the
princdfcs
was
as
untidy
as
her
father
was
tidy
.
she
put
down
the
geometry
book
and
eagerly
broke
the
seal
of
her
letter
.
it
was
from
her
most
intimate
friend
from
childhood
that
same
julie
kara
gina
who
had
been
at
the
rost6vs
nameday
party
.
julie
wrote
in
french
dear
and
precious
friend
how
terrible
and
frightful
a
thing
is
separation
though
i
tell
my
self
that
half
my
life
and
half
my
happiness
are
wrapped
up
in
you
and
that
in
spite
of
the
distance
separating
us
our
hearts
are
united
by
indissoluble
bonds
my
heart
rebels
against
fate
and
in
spite
of
the
pleasures
and
distractions
around
me
i
cannot
overcome
a
certain
secret
sorrow
that
has
been
in
my
heart
ever
since
we
parted
.
why
are
we
not
together
as
we
were
last
summer
in
your
big
study
on
the
blue
sofa
the
confidential
sofa
why
can
not
i
now
as
three
months
ago
draw
fresh
moral
strength
from
your
look
so
gen

and

trating
a
look
i
loved
so
well
and
seem
to

as
i
write
having
read
thus
far
princess
mary
sighed
and
glanced
into
the
mirror
which
stood
on
her
right
.
it
reflected
a
weak
ungraceful
figure
and
thin
face
.
her
eyes
always
sad
now
looked
with
particular
hopelessness
at
her
reflection
in
the
glass
.
she
flatters
me
thought
the
princess
turning
away
and
continuing
to
read
.
but
julie
did
not
flatter
her
friend
the
princess
eyes
large
deep
and
luminous
it
seemed
as
if
at
times
there
radiated
from
them
shafts
of
warm
light
were
so
beautiful
that
very
of
ten
in
spite
of
the
plainness
of
her
face
they
gave
her
an
at
traction
more
powerful
than
that
of
beauty
.
but
the
princess
never
saw
the
beautiful
ex
pression
of
her
own
eyes
the
look
they
had
when
she
was
not
thinking
of
herself
.
as
with
everyone
her
face
assumed
a
forced
unnatural
expression
as
soon
as
she
looked
in
a
glass
.
she
went
on
reading
all
moscow
talks
of
nothing
but
war
.
one
of
my
two
brothers
is
already
abroad
the
other
is
with
the
guards
who
are
starting
on
their
march
to
the
frontier
.
our
dear
emperor
has
left
petersburg
and
it
is
thought
intends
to
expose
his
precious
person
to
the
chances
of
war
.
god
grant
that
the
corsican
monster
who
is
destroying
the
peace
of
europe
may
be
overthrown
by
the
angel
whom
it
has
pleased
the
almighty
in
his
goodness
to
give
us
as
sovereignl
to
say
nothing
of
my
brothers
this
war
has
deprived
me
of
one
of
the
associations
nearest
my
heart
.
i
mean
young
nicholas
rostov
who
with
his
enthusiasm
could
not
bear
to
remain
inactive
and
has
left
the
university
to
join
the
army
.
i
will
confess
to
you
dear
mary
that
in
spite
of
his
extreme
youth
his
departure
for
the
army
one
49
was
a
great
grief
to
me
.
this
young
man
of
whom
i
spoke
to
you
last
summer
is
so
nobleminded
and
full
of
that
real
youthfulness
which
one
sel
dom
finds
nowadays
among
our
old
men
of
twenty
and
particularly
he
is
so
frank
and
has
so
much
heart
.
he
is
so
pure
and
poetic
that
my
relations
with
him
transient
as
they
were
have
been
one
of
the
sweetest
comforts
to
my
poor
heart
which
has
already
suffered
so
much
.
someday
i
will
tell
you
about
our
parting
and
all
that
was
said
then
.
that
is
still
too
fresh
.
ah
dear
friend
you
are
happy
not
to
know
these
poignant
joys
and
sor
rows
.
you
are
fortunate
for
the
latter
are
gen
erally
the
stronger
i
know
very
well
that
count
nicholas
is
too
young
ever
to
be
more
to
me
than
a
friend
but
this
sweet
friendship
this
poetic
and
pure
intimacy
were
what
my
heart
needed
.
but
enough
of
this
the
chief
news
about
which
all
moscow
gossips
is
the
death
of
old
count
bezuk
hov
and
his
inheritance
.
fancy
the
three
prin
cesses
have
received
very
little
prince
vasili
noth
ing
and
it
is
monsieur
pierre
who
has
inherited
all
the
property
and
has
besides
been
recognized
as
legitimate
so
that
he
is
now
count
bezukhov
and
possessor
of
the
finest
fortune
in
russia
.
it
is
rumored
that
prince
vasili
played
a
very
despi
cable
part
in
this
affair
and
that
he
returned
to
petersburg
quite
crestfallen
.
i
confess
i
understand
very
little
about
all
these
matters
of
wills
and
inheritance
but
i
do
know
that
since
this
young
man
whom
we
all
used
to
know
as
plain
monsieur
pierre
has
become
count
bezukhov
and
the
owner
of
one
of
the
largest
fortunes
in
russia
i
am
much
amused
to
watch
the
change
in
the
tone
and
manners
of
the
mam
mas
burdened
by
marriageable
daughters
and
of
the
young
ladies
themselves
toward
him
though
between
you
and
me
he
always
seemed
to
me
a
poor
sort
of
fellow
.
as
for
the
past
two
years
people
have
amused
themselves
by
finding
husbands
for
me
most
of
whom
i
dont
even
know
the
match
making
chronicles
of
moscow
now
speak
of
me
as
the
f
u
ture
countess
bezukhova
.
but
you
will
under
stand
that
i
have
no
desire
for
the
post
.
a
propos
of
marriages
do
you
know
that
a
while
ago
that
universal
auntie
anna
mikhaylovna
told
me
un
der
the
seal
of
strict
secrecy
of
a
plan
of
marriage
for
you
.
it
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
with
prince
vasflis
son
anatole
whom
they
wish
to
re
form
by
marrying
him
to
someone
rich
and
dis
tinguee
and
it
is
on
you
that
his
relations
choice
has
fallen
.
i
dont
know
what
you
will
think
of
it
but
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
let
you
know
of
it
.
he
is
said
to
be
very
handsome
and
a
terrible
scape
grace
.
that
is
all
i
have
been
able
to
find
out
about
him
.
but
enough
of
gossip
.
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
second
sheet
of
paper
and
mamma
has
sent
for
me
to
go
and
dine
at
the
apraksins
.
read
the
mystical
book
i
am
sending
you
it
has
an
enormous
success
here
.
though
there
are
things
in
it
difficult
for
the
feeble
human
mind
to
grasp
it
is
an
admirable
5
war
and
peace
book
which
calms
and
elevates
the
soul
.
adieu
give
my
respects
to
monsieur
your
father
and
my
compliments
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
.
1
em
brace
you
as
i
love
you
.
julie
p
.s
.
let
me
have
news
of
your
brother
and
his
charming
little
wife
.
the
princess
pondered
awhile
with
a
thoughtful
smile
and
her
luminous
eyes
lit
up
so
that
her
face
was
entirely
transformed
.
then
she
suddenly
rose
and
with
her
heavy
tread
went
up
to
the
table
.
she
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
her
hand
moved
rapidly
over
it
.
this
is
the
reply
she
wrote
also
in
french
dear
and
precious
friend
your
letter
of
the
ith
has
given
me
great
delight
.
so
you
still
love
me
my
romantic
julie
separation
of
which
you
say
so
much
that
is
bad
does
not
seem
to
have
had
its
usual
effect
on
you
.
you
complain
of
our
sepa
ration
.
what
then
should
i
say
if
i
dared
com
plain
i
who
am
deprived
of
all
who
are
dear
to
me
ah
if
we
had
not
religion
to
console
us
life
would
be
very
sad
.
why
do
you
suppose
that
i
should
look
severely
on
your
affection
for
that
young
man
on
such
matters
i
am
only
severe
with
myself
.
i
understand
such
feelings
in
others
and
if
never
having
felt
them
i
cannot
approve
of
them
neither
do
i
condemn
them
.
only
it
seems
to
me
that
christian
love
love
of
ones
neighbor
love
of
ones
enemy
is
worthier
sweeter
and
bet
ter
than
the
feelings
which
the
beautiful
eyes
of
a
young
man
can
inspire
in
a
romantic
and
loving
young
girl
like
yourself
.
the
news
of
count
beziikhovs
death
reached
us
before
your
letter
and
my
father
was
much
affected
by
it
.
he
says
the
count
was
the
last
rep
resentative
but
one
of
the
great
century
and
that
it
is
his
own
turn
now
but
that
he
will
do
all
he
can
to
let
his
turn
come
as
late
as
possible
.
god
preserve
us
from
that
terrible
misfortune
i
cannot
agree
with
you
about
pierre
whom
i
knew
as
a
child
.
he
always
seemed
to
me
to
have
an
excellent
heart
and
that
is
the
quality
i
value
most
in
people
.
as
to
his
inheritance
and
the
part
played
by
prince
vasili
it
is
very
sad
for
both
.
ah
my
dear
friend
our
divine
saviours
words
that
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
king
dom
of
god
are
terribly
true
.
i
pity
prince
vasili
but
am
still
more
sorry
for
pierre
.
so
young
and
burdened
with
such
riches
to
what
temptations
he
will
be
exposedl
if
i
were
asked
what
i
desire
most
on
earth
it
would
be
to
be
poorer
than
the
poorest
beggar
.
a
thousand
thanks
dear
friend
for
the
volume
you
have
sent
me
and
which
has
such
success
in
moscow
.
yet
since
you
tell
me
that
among
some
good
things
it
contains
others
which
our
weak
human
understanding
cannot
grasp
it
seems
to
me
rather
useless
to
spend
time
in
reading
what
is
unintelligible
and
can
therefore
bear
no
fruit
.
i
never
could
understand
the
fondness
some
people
have
for
confusing
their
minds
by
dwelling
on
myical
books
that
merely
awaken
their
doubts
and
excite
their
imagination
giving
them
a
bent
for
exaggeration
quite
contrary
to
christian
sim
plicity
.
let
us
rather
read
the
epistles
and
gospels
.
let
us
not
seek
to
penetrate
what
mysteries
they
contain
for
how
can
we
miserable
sinners
that
we
are
know
the
terrible
and
holy
secrets
of
provi
dence
while
we
remain
in
this
flesh
which
forms
an
impenetrable
veil
between
us
and
the
eternal
let
us
rather
confine
ourselves
to
studying
those
sublime
rules
which
our
divine
saviour
has
left
for
our
guidance
here
below
.
let
us
try
to
conform
to
them
and
follow
them
and
let
us
be
persuaded
that
the
less
we
let
our
feeble
human
minds
roam
the
better
we
shall
please
god
who
rejects
all
knowledge
that
does
not
come
from
him
and
the
less
we
seek
to
fathom
what
he
has
been
pleased
to
conceal
from
us
the
sooner
will
he
vouchsafe
its
revelation
to
us
through
his
divine
spirit
.
my
father
has
not
spoken
to
me
of
a
suitor
but
has
only
told
me
that
he
has
received
a
letter
and
is
expecting
a
visit
from
prince
vasili
.
in
regard
to
this
project
of
marriage
for
me
i
will
tell
you
dear
sweet
friend
that
i
look
on
marriage
as
a
divine
institution
to
which
we
must
conform
.
however
painful
it
may
be
to
me
should
the
al
mighty
ever
lay
the
duties
of
wife
and
mother
upon
me
i
shall
try
to
perform
them
as
faithfully
as
i
can
without
disquieting
myself
by
examining
my
feelings
toward
him
whom
he
may
give
me
for
husband
.
i
have
had
a
letter
from
my
brother
who
an
nounces
his
speedy
arrival
at
bald
hills
with
his
wife
.
this
pleasure
will
be
but
a
brief
one
how
ever
for
he
will
leave
us
again
to
take
part
in
this
unhappy
war
into
which
we
have
been
drawn
god
knows
how
or
why
.
not
only
where
you
are
at
the
heart
of
affairs
and
of
the
world
is
the
talk
all
of
war
even
here
amid
fieldwork
and
the
calm
of
nature
which
townsfolk
consider
char
acteristic
of
the
country
rumors
of
war
are
heard
and
painfully
felt
.
my
father
talks
of
nothing
but
marches
and
countermarches
things
of
which
1
understand
nothing
and
the
day
before
yesterday
during
my
daily
walk
through
the
village
i
wit
nessed
a
heartrending
scene
.

..
.
it
was
a
convoy
of
conscripts
enrolled
from
our
people
and
start
ing
to
join
the
army
.
you
should
have
seen
the
state
of
the
mothers
wives
and
children
of
the
men
who
were
going
and
should
have
heard
the
sobs
.
it
seems
as
though
mankind
has
forgotten
the
laws
of
its
divine
saviour
who
preached
love
and
forgiveness
of
injuries
and
that
men
attribute
the
greatest
merit
to
skill
in
killing
one
another
.
adieu
dear
and
kind
friend
may
our
divine
saviour
and
his
most
holy
mother
keep
you
in
their
holy
and
allpowerful
carel
mary
ah
you
are
sending
off
a
letter
princess
i
have
already
dispatched
mine
.
i
have
written
to
my
poor
mother
said
the
smiling
mademoi
selle
bourienne
rapidly
in
her
pleasant
mellow
book
one
tones
and
with
guttural
rs
.
she
brought
into
princess
marys
strenuous
mournful
and
gloomy
world
a
quite
different
atmosphere
careless
lighthearted
and
self
satisfied
.
princess
i
must
warn
you
she
added
low
ering
her
voice
and
evidently
listening
to
her
self
with
pleasure
and
speaking
with
exagger
ated
grasseyement
the
prince
has
been
scold
ing
michael
ivanovich
.
he
is
in
a
very
bad
hu
mor
very
morose
.
be
prepared
.
ah
dear
friend
replied
princess
mary
i
have
asked
you
never
to
warn
me
of
the
humor
my
father
is
in
.
i
do
not
allow
my
self
to
judge
him
and
would
not
have
others
do
so
.
the
princess
glanced
at
her
watch
and
see
ing
that
she
was
five
minutes
late
in
starting
her
practice
on
the
clavichord
went
into
the
sitting
room
with
a
look
of
alarm
.
between
twelve
and
two
oclock
as
the
day
was
mapped
out
the
prince
rested
and
the
princess
played
the
clavichord
.
chapter
xxvi
the
crayhaired
valet
was
sitting
drowsily
lis
tening
to
the
snoring
of
the
prince
who
was
in
his
large
study
.
from
the
far
side
of
the
house
through
the
closed
doors
came
the
sound
of
difficult
passages
twenty
times
repeated
of
a
sonata
by
dussek
.
just
then
a
closed
carriage
and
another
with
a
hood
drove
up
to
the
porch
.
prince
andrew
got
out
of
the
carriage
helped
his
little
wife
to
alight
and
let
her
pass
into
the
house
before
him
.
old
tfkhon
wearing
a
wig
put
his
head
out
of
the
door
of
the
antechamber
reported
in
a
whisper
that
the
prince
was
sleeping
and
hastily
closed
the
door
.
tfkhon
knew
that
nei
ther
the
sons
arrival
nor
any
other
unusual
event
must
be
allowed
to
disturb
the
appointed
order
of
the
day
.
prince
andrew
apparently
knew
this
as
well
as
tfkhon
he
looked
at
his
watch
as
if
to
ascertain
whether
his
fathers
hab
its
had
changed
since
he
was
at
home
last
and
having
assured
himself
that
they
had
not
he
turned
to
his
wife
.
he
will
get
up
in
twenty
minutes
.
let
us
go
across
to
marys
room
he
said
.
the
little
princess
had
grown
stouter
during
this
time
but
her
eyes
and
her
short
downy
smiling
lip
lifted
when
she
began
to
speak
just
as
merrily
and
prettily
as
ever
.
why
this
is
a
palace
she
said
to
her
hus
band
looking
around
with
the
expression
with
1
the
guttural
pronunciation
of
the
letter
r
chiefly
affected
by
parisians
.tr
.
which
people
compliment
their
host
at
a
ball
.
lets
come
quick
quick
and
with
a
glance
round
she
smiled
at
tfkhon
at
her
husband
and
at
the
footman
who
accompanied
them
.
is
that
mary
practicing
lets
goquietlyand
take
her
by
surprise
.
prince
andrew
followed
her
with
a
courteous
but
sad
expression
.
youve
grown
older
tfkhon
he
said
in
passing
to
the
old
man
who
kissed
his
hand
.
before
they
reached
the
room
from
which
the
sounds
of
the
clavichord
came
the
pretty
fair
haired
frenchwoman
mademoiselle
bouri
enne
rushed
out
apparently
beside
herself
with
delight
.
ah
what
joy
for
the
princess
exclaimed
she
at
last
i
must
let
her
know
.
no
no
please
not

.

.

.
you
are
mademoiselle
bourienne
said
the
little
princess
kissing
her
.
i
know
you
already
through
my
sisterinlaws
friendship
for
you
.
she
was
not
expecting
us
they
went
up
to
the
door
of
the
sitting
room
from
which
came
the
sound
of
the
oftrepeated
passage
of
the
sonata
.
prince
andrew
stopped
and
made
a
grimace
as
if
expecting
something
unpleasant
.
the
little
princess
entered
the
room
.
the
passage
broke
off
in
the
middle
a
cry
was
heard
then
princess
marys
heavy
tread
and
the
sound
of
kissing
.
when
prince
andrew
went
in
the
two
princesses
who
had
only
met
once
before
for
a
short
time
at
his
wedding
were
in
each
others
arms
warmly
pressing
their
lips
to
whatever
place
they
happened
to
touch
.
mademoiselle
bourienne
stood
near
them
press
ing
her
hand
to
her
heart
with
a
beatific
smile
and
obviously
equally
ready
to
cry
or
to
laugh
.
prince
andrew
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
frowned
as
lovers
of
music
do
when
they
hear
a
false
note
.
the
two
women
let
go
of
one
an
other
and
then
as
if
afraid
of
being
too
late
seized
each
others
hands
kissing
them
and
pulling
them
away
and
again
began
kissing
each
other
on
the
face
and
then
to
prince
an
drews
surprise
both
began
to
cry
and
kissed
again
.
mademoiselle
bourienne
also
began
to
cry
.
prince
andrew
evidently
felt
ill
at
ease
but
to
the
two
women
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
they
should
cry
and
apparently
it
never
entered
their
heads
that
it
could
have
been
otherwise
at
this
meeting
.
ah
my
dear

.

.

.
ah
mary

.

.

.
they
sud
denly
exclaimed
and
then
laughed
.
i
dreamed
last
night

.

.

.you
were
not
expecting
us

.

.

.ah
mary
you
have
got
thinner

.

.

and
you
have
grown
stouter

..
.
war
and
peace
i
knew
the
princess
at
once
put
in
made
moiselle
bourienne
.
and
i
had
no
idea

.

.

.
exclaimed
prin
cess
mary
.
ah
andrew
i
did
not
see
you
.
prince
andrew
and
his
sister
hand
in
hand
kissed
one
another
and
he
told
her
she
was
still
the
same
crybaby
as
ever
.
princess
mary
had
turned
toward
her
brother
and
through
her
tears
the
loving
warm
gentle
look
of
her
large
luminous
eyes
very
beautiful
at
that
moment
rested
on
prince
andrews
face
.
the
little
princess
talked
incessantly
her
short
downy
upper
lip
continually
and
rapid
ly
touching
her
rosy
nether
lip
when
necessary
and
drawing
up
again
next
moment
when
her
face
broke
into
a
smile
of
glittering
teeth
and
sparkling
eyes
.
she
told
of
an
accident
they
had
had
on
the
spisski
hill
which
might
have
been
serious
for
her
in
her
condition
and
immedi
ately
after
that
informed
them
that
she
had
left
all
her
clothes
in
petersburg
and
that
heaven
knew
what
she
would
have
to
dress
in
here
and
that
andrew
had
quite
changed
and
that
kitty
odyntsova
had
married
an
old
man
and
that
there
was
a
suitor
for
mary
a
real
one
but
that
they
would
talk
of
that
later
.
princess
mary
was
still
looking
silently
at
her
brother
and
her
beautiful
eyes
were
full
of
love
and
sadness
.
it
was
plain
that
she
was
following
a
train
of
thought
independent
of
her
sisterin
laws
words
.
in
the
midst
of
a
description
of
the
last
petersburg
fete
she
addressed
her
broth
er
so
you
are
really
going
to
the
war
andrew
she
said
sighing
.
lise
sighed
too
.
yes
and
even
tomorrow

princess
mary
did
not
listen
to
the
end
but
continuing
her
train
of
thought
turned
to
her
sisterinlaw
with
a
tender
glance
at
her
figure
.
is
it
certain
she
said
.
the
face
of
the
little
princess
changed
.
she
sighed
and
said
yes
quite
certain
.
ahl
it
is
very
dreadful

.

.

.
her
lip
descended
.
she
brought
her
face
close
to
her
sisterinlaws
and
unexpectedly
again
began
to
cry
.
she
needs
rest
said
prince
andrew
with
a
frown
.
dont
you
lise
take
her
to
your
room
and
ill
go
to
father
.
how
is
he
just
the
same
yes
just
the
same
.
though
i
dont
know
what
fyour
opinion
will
be
answered
the
prin
cess
joyfully
.
and
are
the
hours
the
same
and
the
walks
in
the
avenues
and
the
lathe
asked
prince
andrew
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
which
showed
that
in
spite
of
all
his
love
and
respect
for
his
father
he
was
aware
of
his
weaknesses
.
the
hours
are
the
same
and
the
lathe
and
also
the
mathematics
and
my
geometry
lessons
said
princess
mary
gleefully
as
if
her
lessons
in
geometry
were
among
the
greatest
delights
of
her
life
.
when
the
twenty
minutes
had
elapsed
and
the
time
had
come
for
the
old
prince
to
get
up
tikhon
came
to
call
the
young
prince
to
his
father
.
the
old
man
made
a
departure
from
his
usual
routine
in
honor
of
his
sons
arrival
he
gave
orders
to
admit
him
to
his
apartments
while
he
dressed
for
dinner
.
the
old
prince
al
ways
dressed
in
oldfashioned
style
wearing
an
antique
coat
and
powdered
hair
and
when
prince
andrew
entered
his
fathers
dressing
room
not
with
the
contemptuous
look
and
manner
he
wore
in
drawing
rooms
but
with
the
animated
face
with
which
he
talked
to
pierre
the
old
man
was
sitting
on
a
large
leathercovered
chair
wrapped
in
a
powder
ing
mantle
entrusting
his
head
to
tikhon
.
ah
heres
the
warrior
wants
to
vanquish
buonaparte
said
the
old
man
shaking
his
powdered
head
as
much
as
the
tail
which
tik
hon
was
holding
fast
to
plait
would
allow
.
you
at
least
must
tackle
him
properly
or
else
if
he
goes
on
like
this
hell
soon
have
us
too
for
his
subjects
how
are
you
and
he
held
out
his
cheek
.
the
old
man
was
in
a
good
temper
after
his
nap
before
dinner
.
he
used
to
say
that
a
nap
after
dinner
was
silver
before
dinner
gold
en
.
he
cast
happy
sidelong
glances
at
his
son
from
under
his
thick
bushy
eyebrows
.
prince
andrew
went
up
and
kissed
his
father
on
the
spot
indicated
to
him
.
he
made
no
reply
on
his
fathers
favorite
topic
making
fun
of
the
military
men
of
the
day
and
more
particular
ly
of
bonaparte
.
yes
father
i
have
come
to
you
and
brought
my
wife
who
is
pregnant
said
prince
andrew
following
every
movement
of
his
fathers
face
with
an
eager
and
respectful
look
.
how
is

smiling
.

he
continued
returning
to
his
hobby
till
me
how
the
germans
have
taught
you
to
fight

by
this
new
science

he
with

that

that

not

from

and
honoring
him

why
i

to

cried
the
old
man
shaking
his
pigtail
to
see
whether
it
was
firmly
plaited
and
grasping
hisson
by
the
hand
.

said
he
rising
from
his
chair
and
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
followed
by
tikhon
who
ran
after
him
handing
him
different
articles
of
clothing
.
what
of

how
will
they

prince
andrew
seeing
that
his
father
in
sisted
began
at
first
reluctantly
but
gradual
ly
with
more
and
more
animation
and
from
habit
changing
unconsciously
from
russian
to
french
as
he
went
on
to
explain
the
plan
of
operation
for
the
coming
campaign
.
he
ex
plained
how
an
army
ninety
thousand
strong
was
to
threaten
prussia
so
as
to
bring
her
out
of
her
neutrality
and
draw
her
into
the
war
how
part
of
that
army
was
to
join
some
swedish
forces
at
stralsund
how
two
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
austrians
with
a
hundred
thousand
russians
were
to
operate
in
italy
and
on
the
rhine
how
fifty
thousand
russians
and
as
many
english
were
to
land
at
naples
and
how
a
total
force
of
five
hundred
thousand
men
was
to
attack
the
french
from
different
sides
.
the
old
prince
did
not
evince
the
least
interest
during
this
explanation
but
as
if
he
were
not
listening
to
it
continued
to
dress
while
walking
about
and
three
times
unexpectedly
interrupted
.
once
he
stopped
it
by
shouting
the
white
one
the
white
one
this
meant
that
tfkhon
was
not
handing
him
the
waistcoat
he
wanted
.
another
time
he
interrupted
saying
and
will
she
soon
be
confined
and
shak
ing
his
head
reproachfully
said
thats
bad
go
on
go
on
.
the
third
interruption
came
when
prince
andrew
was
finishing
his
description
.
the
old
man
began
to
sing
in
the
cracked
voice
of

chapter

at
the
appointed
hour
the
prince
powdered
and
shaven
entered
the
dining
room
where
his
daughterinlaw
princess
mary
and
mademoi
selle
bourienne
were
already
awaiting
him
to
gether
with
his
architect
who
by
a
strange
ca
price
of
his
employers
was
admitted
to
table
though
the
position
of
that
insignificant
indi
vidual
was
such
as
could
certainly
not
have
caused
him
to
expect
that
honor
.
the
prince
who
generally
kept
very
strictly
to
social
dis
tinctions
and
rarely
admitted
even
important
government
officials
to
his
table
had
unex
pectedly
selected
michael
iviinovich
who
al
ways
went
into
a
corner
to
blow
his
nose
on
his
checked
handkerchief
to
illustrate
the
theory
that
all
men
are
equals
and
had
more
than
once
impressed
on
his
daughter
that
michael
ivanovich
was
not
a
whit
worse
than
you
or
i
.
at
dinner
the
prince
usually
spoke
to
the
taciturn
michael
ivanovich
more
often
than
to
anyone
else
.
in
the
dining
room
which
like
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
was
exceedingly
lofty
the
mem
bers
of
the
household
and
the
footmen
one
behind
each
chair
stood
waiting
for
the
prince
to
enter
.
the
head
butler
napkin
on
arm
was
scanning
the
setting
of
the
table
making
signs
to
the
footmen
and
anxiously
glancing
from
the
clock
to
the
door
by
which
the
prince
was
to
enter
.
prince
andrew
was
looking
at
a
large
gilt
frame
new
to
him
containing
the
genealogical
tree
of
the
princes
bolk6n
ski
opposite
which
hung
another
such
frame
with
a
badly
painted
portrait
evidently
by
the
hand
of
the
artist
belonging
to
the
estate
of
a
ruling
prince
in
a
crown
an
alleged
de
scendant
of
rurik
and
ancestor
of
the
bolkdn
skis
.
prince
andrew
looking
again
at
that
gene

tree
shook
his
head
laughing
as
a
man

who
looks
at
a
portrait

how
thoroughly

that
is
he
said
to
princess
mary
who
had
come
up
to
him
.
princess
mary
looked
at
her
brother
in
sur
prise
.
she
did
not
understand
what
he
was
laughing
at
.
everything
her
father
did
inspired
her
with
reverence
and
was
beyond
question
.

andrew

his
powerful
mind

in
such
nonsense
princess
mary
could
not

ness
of
her
brothers
criticism
and
was
about
to
reply
when
the
expected
footsteps
were
heard
coming
from
the
study
.
the
prince
walked
in
quickly
and
jauntily
as
was
his
wont
as
if
in
tentionally
contrasting
the
briskness
of
his
manners
with
the
strict
formality
of
his
house
.
at
that
moment
the
great
clock
struck
two
and
another
with
a
shrill
tone
joined
in
from
the
drawing
room
.
the
prince
stood
still
his
lively
glittering
eyes
from
under
their
thick
bushy
eyebrows
sternly
scanned
all
present
and
rested
on
the
little
princess
.
she
felt
as
courtiers
do
when
the
tsar
enters
the
sensation
of
fear
and
respect
which
the
old
man
inspired
in
all
around
him
.
he
stroked
her
hair
and
then
pat
ted
her
awkwardly
on
the
back
of
her
neck
.
im
glad
glad
to
see
you
he
said
looking
attentively
into
her
eyes
and
then
quickly
went
to
his
place
and
sat
down
.

a
footman
moved
the
chair
for
her
.

the
old
man
casting
his
eyes
on
her
rounded
figure
.

laughed
in

with
his

not

his

said
.
the
little
princess
did
not
or
did
not
wish
to
hear
his
words
.
she
was
silent
and
seemed
confused
.
the
prince
asked
her
about
her
fa
ther
and
she
began
to
smile
and
talk
.
he
asked
about
mutual
acquaintances
and
she
became
still
more
animated
and
chattered
away
giving
him
greetings
from
various
people
and
retail
ing

her

she
said
growing
more
and
more
lively
.
as
she
became
animated
the
prince
looked
at
her
more
and
more
sternly
and
suddenly
as
if
he
had
studied
her
sufficiently
and
had
formed
a
definite
idea
of
her
he
turned
away
war
and
peace
and
addressed
michael
ivnovich
.

prince
andrew
he
always
spoke
thus
of
his
son
has
been
telling
me
what
forces
are
being
collected
against
him
while
you
and
i
never
thought
much
of
him
.
michael
ivdnovich
did
not
at
all
know
when
you
and
i
had
said
such
things
about
bon
aparte
but
understanding
that
he
was
wanted
as
a
peg
on
which
to
hang
the
princes
favorite
topic
he
looked
inquiringly
at
the
young
prince
wondering
what
would
follow
.
he
is
a
great
tactician
said
the
prince
to
his
son
pointing
to
the
architect
.
and
the
conversation
again
turned
on
the
war
on
bonaparte
and
the
generals
and
states
men
of
the
day
.
the
old
prince
seemed
con
vinced
not
only
that
all
the
men
of
the
day
were
mere
babies
who
did
not
know
the
abc
of
war
or
of
politics
and
that
bonaparte
was
an
insignificant
little
frenchy
successful
only
because
there
were
no
longer
any
potemkins
or
suvrirovs
left
to
oppose
him
but
he
was
al
so
convinced
that
there
were
no
political
diffi
culties
in
europe
and
no
real
war
but
only
a
sort
of
puppet
show
at
which
the
men
of
the
day
were
playing
pretending
to
do
something
real
.
prince
andrew
gaily
bore
with
his
fathers
ridicule
of
the
new
men
and
drew
him
on
and
listened
to
him
with
evident
pleasure
.

said

he

the
same
thing
.
to
be
sure
your
excellency
replied
the
architect
.
the
prince
again
laughed
his
frigid
laugh
.
buonaparte
was
born
with
a
silver
spoon
in
his
mouth
.
he
has
got
splendid
soldiers
.
be
sides
he
began
by
attacking

and
on

failed
to

.
since
the
world
began
everybody
has
beaten
the
ger
mans
.
they
beat
no
one
except
one
another
.
he
made
his
reputation
fighting
them
.
and
the
prince
began
explaining
all
the
blunders
which
according
to
him
bonaparte
had
made
in
his
campaigns
and
even
in
poli
tics
.
his
son
made
no
rejoinder
but
it
was
evi
dent
that
whatever
arguments
were
presented
he
was
as
little
able
as
his
father
to
change
his
opinion
.
he
listened
refraining
from
a
reply
and
involuntarily
wondered
how
this
old
man
living
alone
in
the
country
for
so
many
years
could
know
and
discuss
so
minutely
and
acute
ly
all
the
recent

hummed
the
prince
out
of
tune
and
with
a
laugh
still
more
so
he
quitted
the
table
.
the
little
princess
during
the
whole
discus
sion
and
the
rest
of

silent

left

answered

chapter
xxviii
prince
andrew
was
to
leave
next
evening
.
the
old
prince
not
altering
his
routine
retired
as
usual
after
dinner
.
the
little
princess
was
in
her
sisterinlaws
room
.
prince
andrew
in
a
traveling
coat
without
epaulettes
had
been
packing
with
his
valet
in
the
rooms
assigned
to
him
.
after
inspecting
the
carriage
himself
and
seeing
the
trunks
put
in
he
ordered
the
horses
to
be
harnessed
.
only
those
things
he
always
kept
with
him
remained
in
his
room
a
small
box
a
large
canteen
fitted
with
silver
plate
two
turkish
pistols
and
a
saber
a
present
from
his
father
who
had
brought
it
from
the
siege
of
ochdkov
.
all
these
traveling
effects
of
prince
andrews
were
in
very
good
order
new
clean
and
in
cloth
covers
carefully
tied
with
tapes
.
when
starting
on
a
journey
or
changing
their
mode
of
life
men
capable
of
reflection
are
generally
in
a
serious
frame
of
mind
.
at
such
moments
one
reviews
the
past
and
plans
for
the
future
.
prince
andrews
face
looked
very
thoughtful
and
tender
.
with
his
hands
behind
him
he
paced
briskly
from
corner
to
corner
of
the
room
looking
straight
before
him
and
thoughtfully
shaking
his
head
.
did
he
fear
going
to
the
war
or
was
he
sad
at
leaving
his
wife
perhaps
both
but
evidently
he
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
in
that
mood
for
hearing
foot
steps
in
the
passage
he
hurriedly
unclasped
his
hands
stopped
at
a
table
as
if
tying
the
cover
of
the
small
box
and
assumed
his
usual
tran
quil
and
impenetrable
expression
.
it
was
the
heavy
tread
of
princess
mary
that
he
heard
.
i
hear
you
have
given
orders
to
harness
she
cried
panting
she
had
apparently
been
running
and
i
did
so
wish
to
have
another
talk
with
you
alone
1
god
knows
how
long
we
may
again
be
parted
.
you
are
not
angry
with
me
for
coming
you
have
changed
so
andrii
sha
she
added
as
if
to
explain
such
a
ques
tion
.
she
smiled
as
she
uttered
his
pet
name
an
drusha
.
it
was
obviously
strange
to
her
to
think
that
this
stern
handsome
man
should
be
andnisha
the
slender
mischievous
boy
who
had
been
her
playfellow
in
childhood
.
war
and
peace
and
where
is
lise
he
asked
answering
her
question
only
by
a
smile
.
she
was
so
tired
that
she
has
fallen
asleep
on
the
sofa
in
my
room
.
oh
andrew
i
what
a
treasure
of
a
wife
you
have
said
she
sitting
down
on
the
sofa
facing
her
brother
.
she
is
quite
a
child
such
a
dear
merry
child
.
i
have
grown
so
fond
of
her
.
prince
andrew
was
silent
but
the
princess
noticed
the
ironical
and
contemptuous
look
that
showed
itself
on
his
face
.
one
must
be
indulgent
to
littleweaknesses
who
is
free
from
them
andrew
dont
forget
that
she
has
grown
up
and
been
educated
in
society
and
so
her
position
now
is
not
a
rosy
one
.
we
should
enter
into
everyones
situation
.
toutcomprendrecest
tout
pardonner
.
1
think
what
it
must
be
for
her
poor
thing
after
what
she
has
been
used
to
to
be
parted
from
her
husband
and
be
left
alone
in
the
country
in
her
condition
its
very
hard
.
prince
andrew
smiled
as
he
looked
at
his
sister
as
we
smile
at
those
we
think
we
thor
oughly
understand
.
you
live
in
the
country
and
dont
think
the
life
terrible
he
replied
.
i

.

.

.
thats
different
.
why
speak
of
me
i
dont
want
any
other
life
and
cant
for
i
know
no
other
.
but
think
andrew
for
a
young
soci
ety
woman
to
be
buried
in
the
country
during
the
best
years
of
her
life
all
alone
for
papa
is
always
busy
and
i

..
.
well
you
know
what
poor
resources
i
have
for
entertaining
a
wom
an
used
to
the
best
society
.
there
is
only
made
moiselle
bourienne

i
dont
like
your
mademoiselle
bourienne
at
all
said
prince
andrew
.
no
she
is
very
nice
and
kind
and
above
all
shes
much
to
be
pitied
.
she
has
no
one
no
one
.
to
tell
the
truth
i
dont
need
her
and
shes
even
in
my
way
.
you
know
i
always
was
a
savage
and
now
am
even
more
so
.
i
like
be
ing
alone
.

.

.

.
father
likes
her
very
much
.
she
and
michael
ivdnovich
are
the
two
people
to
whom
he
is
always
gentle
and
kind
because
he
has
been
a
benefactor
to
them
both
.
as
sterne
says
we
dont
love
people
so
much
for
the
good
they
have
done
us
as
for
the
good
we
have
done
them
.
father
took
her
when
she
was
homeless
after
losing
her
own
father
.
she
is
very
goodnatured
and
my
father
likes
her
way
of
reading
.
she
reads
to
him
in
the
evenings
and
reads
splendidly
.
to
be
quite
frank
mary
i
expect
fathers
character
sometimes
makes
things
trying
for
1
to
understand
all
is
to
forgive
all
.
you
doesnt
it
prince
andrew
asked
sud
denly
.
princess
mary
was
first
surprised
and
then
aghast
at
this
question
.
for
me
for
me


.

.
trying
for
mel

.

.

.
said
she
.
he
always
was
rather
harsh
and
now
i
should
think
hes
getting
very
trying
said
prince
andrew
apparently
speaking
lightly
of
their
father
in
order
to
puzzle
or
test
his
sister
.
you
are
good
in
every
way
andrew
but
you
have
a
kind
of
intellectual
pride
said
the
princess
following
the
train
of
her
own
thoughts
rather
than
the
trend
of
the
conversation
and
thats
a
great
sin
.
how
can
one
judge
father
but
even
if
one
might
what
feeling
except
veneration
could
such
a
man
as
my
father
evoke
and
i
am
so
contented
and
happy
with
him
.
i
only
wish
you
were
all
as
happy
as
i
am
.
her
brother
shook
his
head
incredulously
.
the
only
thing
that
is
hard
for
me

..
.
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
andrew

..
.
is
fathers
way
of
treating
religious
subjects
.
i
dont
un
derstand
how
a
man
of
his
immense
intellect
can
fail
to
see
what
is
as
clear
as
day
and
can
go
so
far
astray
.
that
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
me
unhappy
.
but
even
in
this
i
can
see
lately
a
shade
of
improvement
.
his
satire
has
been
less
bitter
of
late
and
there
was
a
monk
he
received
and
had
a
long
talk
with
.
ah
my
dear
i
am
afraid
you
and
your
monk
are
wasting
your
powder
said
prince
andrew
banteringly
yet
tenderly
.
ah
mon
ami
i
only
pray
and
hope
that
god
will
hear
me
.
andrew

.

.

.
she
said
timid
ly
after
a
moments
silence
i
have
a
great
favor
to
ask
of
you
.
what
is
it
dear
no
promise
that
you
will
not
refuse
it
will
give
you
no
trouble
and
is
nothing
un
worthy
of
you
but
it
will
comfort
me
.
promise
andrusha

.

.

.
said
she
putting
her
hand
in
her
reticule
but
not
yet
taking
out
what
she
was
holding
inside
it
as
if
what
she
held
were
the
subject
of
her
request
and
must
not
be
shown
before
the
request
was
granted
.
she
looked
timidly
at
her
brother
.
even
if
it
were
a
great
deal
of
trouble

.

.

.
answered
prince
andrew
as
if
guessing
what
it
was
about
.
think
what
you
please
i
know
you
are
just
like
father
.
think
as
you
please
but
do
this
for
my
sakel
please
do
fathers
father
our
grandfather
wore
it
in
all
his
wars
.
she
still
book
one
did
not
take
out
what
she
was
holding
n
her
reticule
.
so
you
promise
of
course
.
what
is
it
andrew
i
bless
you
with
this
icon
and
you
must
promise
me
you
will
never
take
it
off
.
do
you
promise
if
it
does
not
weigh
a
hundredweight
and
wont
break
my
neck

.

.

.
to
please
you

..
.
said
prince
andrew
.
but
immediately
notic
ing
the
pained
expression
his
joke
had
brought
to
his
sisters
face
he
repented
and
added
i
am
glad
really
dear
i
am
very
glad
.
against
your
will
he
will
save
and
have
mercy
on
you
and
bring
you
to
himself
for
in
him
alone
is
truth
and
peace
said
she
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
solemnly
hold
ing
up
in
both
hands
before
her
brother
a
small
oval
antique
darkfaced
icon
of
the
saviour
in
a
gold
setting
on
a
finely
wrought
silver
chain
.
she
crossed
herself
kissed
the
icon
and
handed
it
to
andrew
.
please
andrew
for
my
sake

.

.

.
rays
of
gentle
light
shone
from
her
large
timid
eyes
.
those
eyes
lit
up
the
whole
of
her
thin
sickly
face
and
made
it
beautiful
.
her
brother
would
have
taken
the
icon
but
she
stopped
him
.
andrew
understood
crossed
him
self
and
kissed
the
icon
.
there
was
a
look
of
tenderness
for
he
was
touched
but
also
a
gleam
of
irony
on
his
face
.
thank
you
my
dear
.
she
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
and
sat
down
again
on
the
sofa
.
they
were
silent
for
a
while
.
as
i
was
saying
to
you
andrew
be
kind
and
generous
as
you
always
used
to
be
.
dont
judge
lise
harshly
she
began
.
she
is
so
sweet
so
goodnatured
and
her
position
now
is
a
very
hard
one
.
i
do
not
think
i
have
complained
of
my
wife
to
you
masha
or
blamed
her
.
why
do
you
say
all
this
to
me
red
patches
appeared
on
princess
marys
face
and
she
was
silent
as
if
she
felt
guilty
.
i
have
said
nothing
to
you
but
you
have
already
been
talked
to
.
and
i
am
sorry
for
that
he
went
on
.
the
patches
grew
deeper
on
her
forehead
neck
and
cheeks
.
she
tried
to
say
something
but
could
not
.
her
brother
had
guessed
right
the
little
princess
had
been
crying
after
dinner
and
had
spoken
of
her
forebodings
about
her
confinement
and
how
she
dreaded
it
and
had
complained
of
her
fate
her
fatherinlaw
and
her
husband
.
after
cry
ing
she
had
fallen
asleep
.
prince
andrew
felt
sorry
for
his
sister
.
57
know
this
mdsha
i
cant
reproach
have
not
reproached
and
never
shall
reproach
my
wife
with
anything
and
i
cannot
reproach
my
self
with
anything
in
regard
to
her
and
that
always
will
be
so
in
whatever
circumstances
i
may
be
placed
.
but
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth

..
.
if
you
want
to
know
whether
i
am
happy
no
is
she
happy
no
but
why
this
is
so
i
dont
know

.

.

.
as
he
said
this
he
rose
went
to
his
sister
and
stooping
kissed
her
forehead
.
his
fine
eyes
lit
up
with
a
thoughtful
kindly
and
unaccus
tomed
brightness
but
he
was
looking
not
at
his
sister
but
over
her
head
toward
the
dark
ness
of
the
open
doorway
.
let
us
go
to
her
i
must
say
goodby
.
or
go
and
wake
her
and
ill
come
in
a
moment
.
petrushka
he
called
to
his
valet
come
here
take
these
away
.
put
this
on
the
seat
and
this
to
the
right
.
princess
mary
rose
and
moved
to
the
door
then
stopped
and
said
andrew
if
you
had
faith
you
would
have
turned
to
god
and
asked
him
to
give
you
the
love
you
do
not
feel
and
your
prayer
would
have
been
an
swered
.
well
may
be
said
prince
andrew
.
go
masha
ill
come
immediately
.
on
the
way
to
his
sisters
room
in
the
pas
sage
which
connected
one
wing
with
the
other
prince
andrew
met
mademoiselle
bourienne
smiling
sweetly
.
it
was
the
third
time
that
day
that
with
an
ecstatic
and
artless
smile
she
had
met
him
in
secluded
passages
.
oh
i
thought
you
were
in
your
room
she
said
for
some
reason
blushing
and
dropping
her
eyes
.
prince
andrew
looked
sternly
at
her
and
an
expression
of
anger
suddenly
came
over
his
face
.
he
said
nothing
to
her
but
looked
at
her
forehead
and
hair
without
looking
at
her
eyes
with
such
contempt
that
the
frenchwoman
blushed
and
went
away
without
a
word
.
when
he
reached
his
sisters
room
his
wife
was
al
ready
awake
and
her
merry
voice
hurrying
one
word
after
another
came
through
the
open
door
.
she
was
speaking
as
usual
in
french
and
as
if
after
long
selfrestraint
she
wished
to
make
up
for
lost
time
.
no
but
imagine
the
old
countess
zubova
1
with
false
curls
and
her
mouth
full
of
false
teeth
as
if
she
were
trying
to
cheat
old
age
.

..
.
ha
ha
ha
mary
this
very
sentence
about
countess
ziibova
1
the
word
zub
means
tooth
and
a
pun
on
this
is
intended
.
tr

war
and
peace
and
this
same
laugh
prince
andrew
had
al
ready
heard
from
his
wife
in
the
presence
of
others
some
five
times
.
he
entered
the
room
softly
.
the
little
princess
plump
and
rosy
was
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
with
her
work
in
her
hands
talking
incessantly
repeating
petersburg
reminiscences
and
even
phrases
.
prince
andrew
came
up
stroked
her
hair
and
asked
if
she
felt
rested
after
their
jour
ney
.
she
answered
him
and
continued
her
chatter
.
the
coach
with
six
horses
was
waiting
at
the
porch
.
it
was
an
autumn
night
so
dark
that
the
coachman
could
not
see
the
carriage
pole
.
servants
with
lanterns
were
bustling
about
in
the
porch
.
the
immense
house
was
brilliant
with
lights
shining
through
its
lofty
windows
.
the
domestic
serfs
were
crowding
in
the
hall
waiting
to
bid
goodby
to
the
young
prince
.
the
members
of
the
household
were
all
gath
ered
in
the
reception
hall
michael
ivdnovich
mademoiselle
bourienne
princess
mary
and
the
little
princess
.
prince
andrew
had
been
called
to
his
fathers
study
as
the
latter
wished
to
say
goodby
to
him
alone
.
all
were
waiting
for
them
to
come
out
.
when
prince
andrew
entered
the
study
the
old
man
in
his
oldage
spectacles
and
white
dressing
gown
in
which
he
received
no

but
his
son
sat
at
the
table

glanced
round

and
he

the

stopped

and
as

not

fixed
his
stern
eyes
on
his
son
.

muttered
the
old
prince
to
himself
finishing
what
he
was
writing
.

he
signed
with
a
flourish
and
suddenly
turn
ing
to
his
son
began
to
laugh
.

the

significantly

he
seized
his
son
by
the
hand
with
small
bony
fingers
shook
it
looked
straight
into
his
sons
face
with
keen
eyes
which
seemed
to
see
through
him
and
again
laughed
his
frigid
laugh
.
the
son
sighed
thus
admitting
that

had

in

while

.
andrew
did
not

he
was
both
pleased
and
displeased
that

he
spoke

rapidly
that

gave

he
paused
unexpected
ly
and
then
in
a
querulous
voice
suddenly
shrieked

that

the

with

the

was
silent

i

prince

the

he
suddenly
shouted
in
a
loud
angry
voice
opening
his
door
.
what
is
it
what
asked
both
princesses
when
they
saw
for
a
moment
at
the
door
prince
andrew
and
the
figure
of
the
old
man
in
a
white
dressing
gown
spectacled
and
wigless
shouting
in
an
angry
voice
.
prince
andrew
sighed
and
made
no
reply
.
well
he
said
turning
to
his
wife
.
and
this
well
sounded
coldly
ironic
as
if
he
were
saying
now
go
through
your
per
formance
.
andrew
already
said
the
little
princess
turning
pale
and
looking
with
dismay
at
her
husband
.
he
embraced
her
.
she
screamed
and
fell
un
conscious
on
his
shoulder
.
he
cautiously
released
the
shoulder
she
leaned
on
looked
into
her
face
and
carefully
placed
her
in
an
easy
chair
.
adieu

said
he
gently
to
his
sister
taking
her
by
the
hand
and
kissing
her
and
then
he
left
the
room
with
rapid
steps

still
looked
with
her
beautiful
eyes
full
of
tears
at
the
door
through
which
prince
andrew
had
gone
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
in
his
di
rection
.
from
the
study
like
pistol
shots
came
the
frequent
sound
of
the
old
man
angrily
blowing
his
nose
.
hardly
had
prince
andrew
gone
when
the
study
door
opened
quickly
and
the
stern

looked
out

1805
chapter
i
in
october
1805
a
russian
army
was
occupy
ing
the
villages
and
towns
of
the
archduchy
of
austria
and
yet
other
regiments
freshly
arriv
ing
from
russia
were
settling
near
the
fortress
of
braunau
and
burdening
the
inhabitants
on
whom
they
were
quartered
.
braunau
was
the
headquarters
of
thecommanderinchief
kutii
zov
.
on
october
11
1805
one
of
the
infantry
regiments
that
had
just
reached
braunau
had
halted
half
a
mile
from
the
town
waiting
to
be
inspected
by
the
commander
in
chief
.
despite
the
unrussian
appearance
of
the
locality
and
surroundings
fruit
gardens
stone
fences
tiled
roofs
and
hills
in
the
distance
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
inhabitants
who
gazed
with
curiosity
at
the
soldiers
were
not
russians
the
regiment
had
just
the
appearance
of
any
rus
sian
regiment
preparing
for
an
inspection
any
where
in
the
heart
of
russia
.
on
the
evening
of
the
last
days
march
an
or
der
had
been
received
that
the
commander
in
chief
would
inspect
the
regiment
on
the
march
.
though
the
words
of
the
order
were
not
clear
to
the
regimental
commander
and
the
ques
tion
arose
whether
the
troops
were
to
be
in
marching
order
or
not
it
was
decided
at
a
con
sultation
between
the
battalion
commanders
to
present
the
regiment
in
parade
order
on
the
principle
that
it
is
always
better
to
bow
too
low
than
not
bow
low
enough
.
so
the
soldiers
after
a
twentymile
march
were
kept
mefl
iing
and
cleaning
all
night
long
without
closing
their
eyes
while
the
adjutants
and
company
commanders
calculated
and
reckoned
and
by
morning
the
regiment
instead
of
the
strag
gling
disorderly
crowd
it
had
been
on
its
last
march
the
day
before
presented
a
wellor
dered
array
of
two
thousand
men
each
of
whom
knew
his
place
and
his
duty
had
every
button
and
every
strap
in
place
and
shone
with
clean
liness
.
and
not
only
externally
was
all
in
or
der
but
had
it
pleased
the
commander
in
chief
to
look
under
the
uniforms
he
would
have
found
on
every
man
a
clean
shirt
and
in
every
knapsack
the
appointed
number
of
articles
awl
soap
and
all
as
the
soldiers
say
.
there
was
only
one
circumstance
concerning
which
no
one
could
be
at
ease
.
it
was
the
state
of
the
soldiers
boots
.
more
than
half
the
mens
boots
were
in
holes
.
but
this
defect
was
not
due
to
any
fault
of
the
regimental
commander
for
in
spite
of
repeated
demands
boots
had
not
been
issued
by
the
austrian
commissariat
and
the
regiment
had
marched
some
seven
hundred
miles
.
the
commander
of
the
regiment
was
an
eld
erly
choleric
stout
and
thickset
general
with
grizzled
eyebrows
and
whiskers
and
wider
from
chest
to
back
than
across
the
shoulders
.
he
had
on
a
brandnew
uniform
showing
the
creases
where
it
had
been
folded
and
thick
gold
epau
lettes
which
seemed
to
stand
rather
than
lie
down
on
his
massive
shoulders
.
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
happily
performing
one
of
the
most
solemn
duties
of
his
life
.
he
walked
about
in
front
of
the
line
and
at
every
step
pulled
him
self
up
slightly
arching
his
back
.
it
was
plain
that
the
commander
admired
his
regiment
re
joiced
in
it
and
that
his
whole
mind
was
en
grossed
by
it
yet
his
strut
seemed
to
indicate
that
besides
military
matters
social
interests
arid
the
fair
sex
occupied
no
small
part
of
his
thoughts
.
well
michael
mftrich
sir
he
said
ad
dressing
one
of
the
battalion
commanders
who
smilingly
pressed
forward
it
was
plain
that
they
both
felt
happy
.
we
had
our
hands
full
last
night
.
however
i
think
the
regiment
is
not
a
bad
one
eh
the
battalion
commander
perceived
the
jo
vial
irony
and
laughed
.
it
would
not
be
turned
off
the
field
even
on
the

.
they
were
an
aulede
camp
followed
by
a
cossack
.
the
aidedecamp
was
sent
to
confirm
the
order
which
had
not
been
clearly
worded
the
day
before
namely
that
the
commander
in
chief
wished
to
see
the
regiment
just
in
the
state
in
which
it
had
been
on
the
march
in
their
greatcoats
and
packs
and
without
any
preparation
whatever
.
a
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
from
vienna
had
come
to
kutuzov
the
day
before
with
pro
posals
and
demands
for
him
to
join
up
with
the
army
of
the
archduke
ferdinand
and
mack
and
kutiizov
not
considering
this
junc
tion
advisable
meant
among
other
arguments
in
support
of
his
view
to
show
the
austrian
general
the
wretched
state
in
which
the
troops
arrived
from
russia
.
with
this
object
he
in
tended
to
meet
the
regiment
so
the
worse
the
condition
it
was
in
the
better
pleased
the
com
mander
in
chief
would
be
.
though
the
aide
decamp
did
not
know
these
circumstances
he
nevertheless
delivered
the
definite
order
that
the
men
should
be
in
their
greatcoats
and
in
marching
order
and
that
the
commander
in
chief
would
otherwise
be
dissatisfied
.
on
hear
ing
this
the
regimental
commander
hung
his
head
silently
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
out
his
arms
with
a
choleric
gesture
.

remarked

how

he
asked
the
aidedecamp
with
a
respectful
politeness
evidently
relating
to
the
personage
he
was
referring
to
.
in

the
regimental
commander
going
up
to
the
line
himself
ordered
the
soldiers
to
change
in
to
their
greatcoats
.
the
company
commanders
ran
off
to
their
companies
the
sergeants
major
began
bustling
the
greatcoats
were
not
in
very
good
condition
and
instantly
the
squares
that
had
up
to
then
been
in
regular
order
and
si
lent
began
to
sway
and
stretch
and
hum
with
voices
.
on
all
sides
soldiers
were
running
to
and
fro
throwing
up
their
knapsacks
with
a
jerk
of
their
shoulders
and
pulling
the
straps
over
their
heads
unstrapping
their
overcoats
and
drawing
the
sleeves
on
with
upraised
arms
.
in
half
an
hour
all
was
again
in
order
only
the
squares
had
become
gray
instead
of
black
.
the
regimental
commander
walked
with
his
jerky
steps
to
the
front
of
the
regiment
and
examined
it
from
a
distance

to

.
when
the
eager
but
misrepeated
words
had
reached
their

in
a
cry
of
the

to

the

of

from

though

was
a

awkwardly

shouted
the
regimental
commander
thrusting
forward
his
jaw
and
pointing
at
a
soldier
in
the
ranks
of
the
third
company
in
a
greatcoat
of

contrasted
with

the
commander
of

with
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
superior
pressed
two
fingers
more
and
more
rigidly
to
his
cap
as
if

hope
of
salvation

and
the
commander
turning
to
look
at
the
adfbifcfitr
directed
his
jerky
steps
down
the
line
.
jhe
was
evidently

at

said

chapter
ii
hes
coming
shouted
the
signaler
at
that
moment
.
the
regimental
commander
flushing
ran
to
his
horse
seized
the
stirrup
with
trembling
hands
threw
his
body
across
the
saddle
righted
himlelf
drew
his
saber
and
with
a
happy
and
resolute
countenance
opening
his
mouth
awry
prepared
to
shout
.
the
regiment
fluttered
like
a
bird
preening
its
plumage
and
became
mo
tionless
.
attention
shouted
the
regimental
com
mander
in
a
soulshaking
voice
which
expressed
joy
for
himself
severity
for
the
regiment
and
welcome
for
the
approaching
chief
.
along
the
broad
country
road
edged
on
botty
sides
by
trees
came
a
high
light
blue
vi
ennese
caliche
slightly
creaking
on
its
springs
and
drawn
by
six
horses
at
a
smart
trot
.
be
hind
the
caliche
galloped
the
suite
and
a
con
voy
of
croats
.
beside
kutuzov
sat
an
austrian
general
in
a
white
uniform
that
looked
strange
among
the
russian
black
ones
.
the
caliche
stopped
in
front
of
the
regiment
.
kutiizov
and
the
austrian
general
were
talking
in
low
voices
and
kutuzov
smiled
slightly
as
treading
heavi
ly
he
stepped
down
from
the
carriage
just
as
if
those
two
thousand
men
breathlessly
gazing
at
him
and
the
regimental
commander
did
not
exist
.
the
word
of
command
rang
out
and
again
the
regiment
quivered
as
with
a
jingling
sound
it
presented
arms
.
then
amidst
a
dead
silence
the
feeble
voice
of
the
commander
in
chief
was
heard
.
the
regiment
roared
health
to
your

lency
and
again
all
be
came
silent
.
at
first
kutuzov
stood
still
while
the
regiment
moved
then
he
and
the
general
in
white
accompanied
by
the
suite
walked
be
tween
the
ranks
.
from
the
way
the
regimental
commander
sa
luted
the
commander
in
chief
and
devoured
him
with
his
eyes
drawing
himself
up
obsequiously
and
from
the
way
he
walked
through
the
ranks
behind
the
generals
bending
forward
and
hardly
able
to
restrain
his
jerky
movements
and
from
the
way
he
darted
forward
at
every
word
or
gesture
of
the
commander
in
chief
it
was
evident
that
he
performed
his
duty
as
a
subordinate
with
even
greater
zeal
than
his
duty
as
a
commander
.
thanks
to
the
strictness
and
assiduity
of
its
commander
the
regiment
in
comparison
with
others
that
had
reached
brau
nau
at
the
same
time
was
in
splendid
condi
tion
.
there
were
only
217
sick
and
stragglers
.
everything
was
in
good
order
except
the
boots
.
kutuzov
walked
through
the
ranks
some
times
stopping
to
say
a
few
friendly
words
to
officers
he
had
known
in
the
turkish
war
some
times
also
to
the
soldiers
.
looking
at
their
boots
he
several
times
shook
his
head
sadly
pointing
them
out
to
the
austrian
general
with
an
ex
pression
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
was
not
blaming
anyone
but
could
not
help
noticing
what
a
bad
state
of
things
it
was
.
the
regimen
tal
commander
ran
forward
on
each
such
occa
sion
fearing
to
miss
a
single
word
of
the
com
mander
in
chiefs
regarding
the
regiment
.
be
hind
kutiizov
at
a
distance
that
allowed
every
softly
spoken
word
to
be
heard
followed
some
twenty
men
of
his
suite
.
these
gentlemen
talked
among
themselves
and
sometimes
book
laughed
.
nearest
of
all
to
the
comma
ader
in
chief
walked
a
handsome
adjutant
.
this
was
prince
bolk6nski
.
beside
him
was
his
comrade
nesvftski
a
tall
staff
officer
extremely
stout
with
a
kindly
smiling
handsome
face
and
moist
eyes
.
nesvitski
could
hardly
keep
from
laughter
provoked
by
a
swarthy
hussar
officer
who
walked
beside
him
.
this
hussar
with
a
grave
face
and
without
a
smile
or
a
change
in
the
expression
of
his
fixed
eyes
watched
the
regimental
commanders
back
and
mimicked
his
every
movement
.
each
time
the
commander
started
and
bent
forward
the
hussar
started
and
bent
forward
in
exactly
the
same
manner
.
nesvitski
laughed
and
nudged
the
others
to
make
them
look
at
the
wag
.
kutuzov
walked
slowly
and
languidly
past
thousands
of
eyes
which
were
starting
from
their
sockets
to
watch
their
chief
.
on
reaching
the
third
company
he
suddenly
stopped
.
his
suite
not
having
expected
this
involuntarily
came
closer
to
him
.
ah
tim6khinl
said
he
recognizing
the
rednosed
captain
who
had
been
reprimanded
on
account
of
the
blue
greatcoat
.
one
would
have
thought
it
impossible
for
a
man
to
stretch
himself
more
than
tim6khin
had
done
when
he
was
reprimanded
by
the
regimental
commander
but
now
that
the
com
mander
in
chief
addressed
him
he
drew
him
self
up
to
such
an
extent
that
it
seemed
he
could
not
have
sustained
it
had
the
commander
in
chief
continued
to
look
at
him
and
so
ku
tuzov
who
evidently
understood
his
case
and
wished
him
nothing
but
good
quickly
turned
away
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
flitting
over
his
scarred
and
puffy
face
.
another
ismail
comrade
said
he
.
a
brave
officer
are
you
satisfied
with
him
he
asked
the
regimental
commander
.
and
the
latter
unconscious
that
he
was
be
ing
reflected
in
the
hussar
officer
as
in
a
look
ing
glass
started
moved
forward
and
an
swered
highly
satisfied
your
excellency
we
all
have
our
weaknesses
said
kutuzov
smiling
and
walking
away
from
him
.
he
used
to
have
a
predilection
for
bacchus
.
the
regimental
commander
was
afraid
he
might
be
blamed
for
this
and
did
not
answer
.
the
hussar
at
that
moment
noticed
the
face
of
the
rednosed
captain
and
his
drawnin
stom
ach
and
mimicked
his
expression
and
pose
with
such
exactitude
that
nesvftski
could
not
help
laughing
.
kutiizov
turned
round
.
the
officer
evidently
had
complete
control
of
his
face
and
while
kutiazov
was
turning
managed
two
63
to
make
a
grimace
and
then
assume
a
most
seri
ous
deferential
and
innocent
expression
.
the
third
company
was
the
last
and
kutu
zov
pondered
apparently
trying
to
recollect
something
.
prince
andrew
stepped
forward
from
among
the
suite
and
said
softly
in
french
you
told
me
to
remind
you
of
the
officer
d61okhov
reduced
to
the
ranks
in
this
regi
ment
.
xflfenml
where
is
d61okhov
asked
kutuzov
.
d61okhov
who
had
already
changed
into
a
soldiers
gray
greatcoat
did
not
wait
to
be
called
.
the
shapely
figure
of
the
fairhaired
sol
dier
with
his
clear
blue
eyes
stepped
forward
from
the
ranks
went
up
to
the
commander
in
chief
and
presented
arms
.

to

kuttizov
asked
witha
slight
frown
.
this

said
prince

kutuzov
.

hope
this
will
be
a
lesson
to
you

the

gracious
and
i

forget
you
if
you

well
.
the
clejtf
.blue
eyes
looked
at
the
commander
in
chijgust
as
boldly
as
they
had
looked
at
the
gftnental
commander
seeming
by
their
ex
pression
to
tear
open
the
veil
of
convention
that
separates
a
commander
in
chief
so
widely
from
a
private
.
one
thing
i
ask
of
your
excellency
d61o
khov
said
in
his
firm
ringing
deliberate
voice
.
i
ask
an
opportunity
to
atone
for
my
fault
and
prove
my
devotion
to
his
majesty
the
emper
or
and
to
russia
kutuzov
turned
away
.
the
same
smile
of
the
eyes
with
which
he
had
turned
from
captain
tim6khin
again
flitted
over
his
face
.
he
turned
away
with
a
grimace
as
if
to
say
that
everything
d61okhov
had
said
to
him
and
everything
he
could
say
had
long
been
known
to
him
that
he
was
weary
of
it
and
it
was
not
at
all
what
he
wanted
.
he
turned
away
and
went
to
the
car
riage
.
the
regiment
broke
up
into
companies
which
went
to
their
appointed
quarters
near
braunau
where
they
hoped
to
receive
boots
and
clothes
and
to
rest
after
their
hard
marches
.
you
wont

the
regimental
commander
over
taking
the
third
company
on
its
way
to
its
quarters
and
riding
up
to
captain
tim6khin
who
was
walking
in

the
regimental

he
was
very
pleased
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
captain

replied
the
captain
his
nose
growing
redder
as
he
gave
a
smile
which
showed
where
two
front
teeth
were
missing
that
had
been
knocked
out
by
the
butt

of

timokhin
.
and
what
about

asked
the
regimental
commander
.

its
different
on

days
answered
the
captain
.
one
day
he
is

well
edu

and
goodnatured
and
the
next
hes

remarked
the

still

timokhin
showing
by

that

well
of

the
regimental
commander
sought
out

in
the
ranks
and
reining
in
his
horse
said

him

the
next

d61okhov
looked
round
but
did
not
say
any
thing
nor
did
the
mocking
smile
on
his
lips
change
.
well
thats
all

continued
the

of

for

from

he
added
so
that
the
soldiers
could

i
thank
you
all

be
praised
and
he
rode
past
that
company
and
overtook
the
next
one
.
well
hes
really
a
good
fellow
one
can
serve
under
him
said
tim6khin
to
the
subal

beside
him

in
a
word
a

said
the
subal

laughing
the
regimental
commander
was
nicknamed
king
of
hearts
.
the
cheerful
mood
of
their
officers
after
the
inspection
infected
the
soldiers
.
the
company
marched
on
gaily
.
the
soldiers
voices
could
be
heard
on
every
side
.
and
they
said
kutiizov

they

here
theyre

to

came
the

der

and
from
the
different
ranks
some
twenty
men
ran
to
the
front
.
a
drummer
their
leader
turned
round
facing
the
singers
and
flourishing
his
arm
began
a
longdrawnout
soldiers
song
commencing
with
the
words
morning
dawned
the
sun
was
rising
arid
concluding
on

brothers

to

led
by
father
kdmenski
this
song
had
been
composed
in
the
turkish
campaign
and
was
now
being
sung
in
austria
the
only
change
being
that
the
words
father
kdmenski
were
replaced
by
father
kutiizov
.
having
jerked
out
these
last
words
as
soldiers
do
and
waved
his
arms
as
if
flinging
something
to
the
ground
the
drummer
a
lean
handsome
soldier
of
fortylooked
sternly
at
the
singers
book
two
and
screwed
up
his
eyes
.
then
having
satisfied
himself
that
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
he
raised
both
arms
as
if
carefully
lifting
some
in
visible
but
precious
object
above
his
head
and
holding
it
there
for
some
seconds
suddenly
flung

chimed
in
twenty
voices
and
the
castanet
player
in
spite
of
the
burden
of
his
equipment
rushed
out
to
the
front
and
walking
backwards
before
the
com
pany
jerked
his
shoulders
and
flourished
his
castanets
as
if
threatening
someone
.
the
sol
diers
swinging
their
arms
and
keeping
time
spontaneously
marched
with
long
steps
.
be
hind
the
company
the
sound
of
wheels
the
creaking
of
springs
and
the
tramp
of
horses
hoofs
were
heard
.
kutuzov
and
his
suite
were
returning
to
the
town
.
the
commander
in
chief
made
a
sign
that
the
men
should
continue
to
march
at
ease
and
he
and
all
his
suite
showed
pleasure
at
the
sound
of
the
singing
and
the
sight
of
the
dancing
soldier
and
the
gay
and
smartly
marching
men
.
in
the
second
file
from
the
right
flank
beside
which
the
carriage
passed
the
company
a
blueeyed
soldier
invol
untarily
attracted
notice
.
it
was
d61okhov
marching
with
particular
grace
and
boldness
in
time
to
the
song
and
looking
at
those
driv
ing
past
as
if
he
pitied
all
who
were
not
at
that
moment
marching
with
the
company
.
the
hus
sar
cornet
of
kutuzovs
suite
who
had
mim
icked
the
regimental
commander
fell
back
from
the
carriage
and
rode
up
to
d61okhov
.
hussar
cornet
zherk6v
had
at
one
time
in
petersburg
belonged
to
the
wild
set
led
by
d61okhov
.
zherk6v
had
met
d61okhov
abroad
as
a
private
and
had
not
seen
fit
to
recognize
him
.
but
now
that
kutuzov
had
spoken
to
the
gentleman
ranker
he
addressed
him
with
the
cordiality
of
an
old
friend
.
my
dear
fellow
how
are
you
said
he
through
the
singing
making
his
horse
keep
pace
with
the
company
.
how
am
i
d61okhov
answered
coldly
.
i
am
as
you
see
.
the
lively
song
gave
a
special
flavor
to
the
tone
of
free
and
easv
gaiety
with
which
zher
k6v
spoke
and
to
the
intentional
coldness
of
d61okhovs
reply
.
and
how
do
you
get
on
with
the
officers
inquired
zherk6v
.
all
right
.
they
are
good
fellows
.
and
how
have
you
wriggled
onto
the
staff
i
was
attached
im
on
duty
.
both
were
silent
.
she
let
the
hawk
fly
upward
from
her
wide
right
sleeve
went
the
song
arousing
an
invol
untary
sensation
of
courage
and
cheerfulness
.
their
conversation
would
probably
have
been
different
but
for
the
effect
of
that
song
.
is
it
true
that
austrians
have
been
beaten
asked
d61okhov
.
the
devil
only
knowsl
they
say
so
.
im
glad
answered
d61okhov
briefly
and
clearly
as
the
song
demanded
.
i
say
come
round
some
evening
and
well
have
a
game
of
farol
said
zherk6v
.
why
have
you
too
much
money
do
come
.
i
cant
.
ive
sworn
not
to
.
i
wont
drink
and
wont
play
till
i
get
reinstated
.
well
thats
only
till
the
first
engagement
.
we
shall
see
.
they
were
again
silent
.
come
if
you
need
anything
.
one
can
at
least
be
of
use
on
the
staff

.

d61okhov
smiled

i
wont

zherkov
touched
his
horse
with
the
spurs
it
pranced
excitedly
from
foot
to
foot
uncertain
with
which
to
start
then
settled
down
galloped
past
the
company
and
overtook
the
carriage
still
keeping
time
to
the
song
.
chapter
iii
on
returning
from
the
review
kutuzov
took
the
austrian
general
into
his
private
room
and
calling
his
adjutant
asked
for
some
papers
re
lating
to
the
condition
of
the
troops
on
their
arrival
and
the
letters
that
had
come
from
the
archduke
ferdinand
who
was
in
command
of
the
advanced
army
.
prince
andrew
bolk6nski
came
into
the
room
with
the
required
papers
.
kutuzov
and
the
austrian
member
of
the
hof
kriegsrath
were
sitting
at
the
table
on
which
a
plan
was
spread
out
.
ahl

.

.

.
said
kutuzov
glancing
at
bolk6n
ski
as
if
by
this
exclamation
he
was
asking
the
adjutant
to
wait
and
he
went
on
with
the
con
versation
in
french
.
all
i
can
say
general
said
he
with
a
pleas
ant
elegance
of
expression
and
intonation
that
obliged
one
to
listen
to
each
deliberately
spok
en
word
.
it
was
evident
that
kutiizov
himself
66
war
and
peace
listened
with
pleasure
to
his
own
voice
.
all
i
can
say
general
is
that
if
the
matter
depend
ed
on
my
personal
wishes
the
will
of
his
maj
esty
the
emperor
francis
would
have
been
ful
filled
long
ago
.
i
should
long
ago
have
joined
the
archduke
.
and
believe
me
on
my
honor
that
to
me
personally
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
hand
over
the
supreme
command
of
the
army
into
the
hands
of
a
better
informed
and
more
skillful
generalof
whom
austria
has
so
many
and
to
lay
down
all
this
heavy
responsibility
.
but
circumstances
are
sometimes
too
strong
for
us
general
.
and
kutuzov
smiled
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
say
you
are
quite
at
liberty
not
to
believe
me
and
i
dont
even
care
whether
you
do
or
not
but
you
have
no
grounds
for
telling
me
so
.
and
that
is
the
whole
point
.
the
austrian
general
looked
dissatisfied
but
had
no
option
but
to
reply
in
the
same
tone
.
on
the
contrary
he
said
in
a
querulous
and
angry
tone
that
contrasted
with
his
flatter
ing
words
on
the
contrary
your
excellencys
participation
in
the
common
action
is
highly
valued
by
his
majesty
but
we
think
the
pres
ent
delay
is
depriving
the
splendid
russian
troops
and
their
commander
of
the
laurels
they
have
been
accustomed
to
win
in
their
battles
he
concluded
his
evidently
prearranged
sen
tence
.
kutuzov
bowed
with
the
same
smile
.
but
that
is
my
conviction
and
judging
by
the
last
letter
with
which
his
highness
the
archduke
ferdinand
has
honored
me
i
imag
ine
that
the
austrian
troops
under
the
direc
tion
of
so
skillful
a
leader
as
general
mack
have
by
now
already
gained
a
decisive
victory
and
no
longer
need
our
aid
said
kutuzov
.
the
general
frowned
.
though
there
was
no
definite
news
of
an
austrian
defeat
there
were
many
circumstances
confirming
the
unfavor
able
rumors
that
were
afloat
and
so
kutuzovs
suggestion
of
an
austrian
victory
sounded
much
like
irony
.
but
kutuzov
went
on
blandly
smil
ing
with
the
same
expression
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
had
a
right
to
suppose
so
.
and
in
fact
the
last
letter
he
had
received
from
macks
army
informed
him
of
a
victory
and
stated
stra
tegically
the
position
of
the
army
was
very
fa
vorable
.
give
me
that
letter
said
kutuzov
turning
to
prince
andrew
.
please
have
a
look
at
it
and
kutuzov
with
an
ironical
smile
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
read
to
the
austrian
gen
eral
the
following
passage
in
german
from
the
archduke
ferdinands
letter
we
have
fully
concentrated
forces
of
nearly
seventy
thousand
men
with
whitfi
to
attack
and
defeat
the
enemy
should
he
cross
the
lech
.
also
as
we
are
masters
of
ulm
we
cannot
be
deprived
of
the
advantage
of
commanding
both
sides
of
the
danube
so
that
should
the
enemy
not
cross
the
lech
we
can
cross
the
danube
throw
ourselves
on
his
line
of
communications
recross
the
river
lower
down
and
frustrate
his
intention
should
he
try
to
direct
his
whole
force
against
our
faithful
ally
.
we
shall
therefore
confidently
await
the
moment
when
the
imperial
russian
army
will
be
fully
equipped
and
shall
then
in
conjunction
with
it
easily
find
a
way
to
prepare
for
the
enemy
the
fate
he
deserves
.
kutuzov
sighed
deeply
on
finishing
this
para
graph
and
looked
at
the
member
of
the
hof
kriegsrath
mildly
and
attentively
.
but
you
know
the
wise
maxim
your
excel
lency
advising
one
to
expect
the
worst
said
the
austrian
general
evidently
wishing
to
have
done
with
jests
and
to
come
to
business
.
he
in
voluntarily
looked
round
at
the
aidedecamp
.
excuse
me
general
interrupted
kutuzov
also
turning
to
prince
andrew
.
look
here
my
dear
fellow
get
from
kozl6vski
all
the
reports
from
our
scouts
.
here
are
two
letters
from
count
nostitz
and
here
is
one
from
his
high
ness
the
archduke
ferdinand
and
here
are
these
he
said
handing
him
several
papers
make
a
neat
memorandum
in
french
out
of
all
this
showing
all
the
news
we
have
had
of
the
movements
of
the
austrian
army
and
then
give
it
to
his
excellency
.
prince
andrew
bowed
his
head
in
token
of
having
understood
from
the
first
not
only
what
had
been
said
but
also
what
kutuzov
would
have
liked
to
tell
him
.
he
gathered
up
the
pa
pers
and
with
a
bow
to
both
stepped
softly
over
the
carpet
and
went
out
into
the
waiting
room
.
though
not
much
time
had
passed
since
prince
andrew
had
left
russia
he
had
changed
greatly
during
that
period
.
in
the
expression
of
his
face
in
his
movements
in
his
walk
scarce
ly
a
trace
was
left
of
his
former
affected
languor
and
indolence
.
he
now
looked
like
a
man
who
has
no
time
to
think
of
the
impression
he
makes
on
others
but
is
occupied
with
agreeable
and
interesting
work
.
his
face
expressed
more
sat
isfaction
with
himself
and
those
around
him
his
smile
and
glance
were
brighter
and
more
at
tractive
.


kutuzov
whom
he
had
overtaken
in
poland
had
received
him
very
kindly
promised
not
to
forget
win
distinguished
him
bove
the
other
adjutants
and
had
taken
him
to
vienna
and
given
him
the
more
serious
commissions
.
from
book
vienna
kuttizov
wrote
to
his
old
comrade
prince
andrews
father
.
your
son
bids
fair
to
become
an
officer
distin
guished
by
his
industry
firmness
and
expedition
.
i
consider
myself
fortunate
to
have
such
a
sub
ordinate
by
me
.
on
kutiizovs
staff
among
his
fellow
officers
and
in
the
army
generally
prince
andrew
had
as
he
had
had
in
petersburg
society
two
quite
opposite
reputations
.
some
a
minority
ac
knowledged
him
to
be
different
from
them
selves
and
from
everyone
else
expected
great
things
of
him
listened
to
him
admired
and
imitated
him
and
with
them
prince
andrew
was
natural
and
pleasant
.
others
the
majority
disliked
him
and
considered
him
conceited
cold
and
disagreeable
.
but
among
these
people
prince
andrew
knew
how
to
take
his
stand
so
that
they
respected
and
even
feared
him
.
coming
out
of
kutiizovs
room
into
the
wait
ing
room
with
the
papers
in
his
hand
prince
andrew
cameip
to
his
comrade
the
aidede
camp
on
duty
kozl6vski
who
was
sitting
at
the
window
with
a
book
.
well
prince
asked
kozl6vski
.
i
am
ordered
to
write
a
memorandum
ex
plaining
why
we
are
not
advancing
.
and
why
is
it
prince
andrew
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
any
news
from
mack
no
.
if
it
were
true
that
he
has
been
beaten
news
would
have
come
.
probably
said
prince
andrew
moving
to
ward
the
outer
door
.
but
at
that
instant
a
tall
austrian
general
in
a
greatcoat
with
the
order
of
maria
theresa
on
his
neck
and
a
black
bandage
round
his
head
who
had
evidently
just
arrived
entered
quick
ly
slamming
the
door
.
prince
andrew
stopped
short
.
commander
in
chief
kutuzov
said
the
newly
arrived
general
speaking
quickly
with
a
harsh
german
accent
looking
to
both
sides
and
advancing
straight
toward
the
inner
door
.
the
commander
in
chief
is
engaged
said
kozl6vski
going
hurriedly
up
to
the
unknown
general
and
blocking
his
way
to
the
door
.
whom
shall
i
announce
the
unknown
general
looked
disdainfully
down
at
kozl6vski
who
was
rather
short
as
if
surprised
that
anyone
should
not
know
him
.
the
commander
in
chief
is
engaged
re
peated
kozl6vski
calmly
.
the
generals
face
clouded
his
lips
quivered
two
67
and
trembled
.
he
took
out
a
notebook
hur
riedly
scribbled
something
in
pencil
tore
out
the
leaf
gave
it
to
kozl6vski
stepped
quickly
to
the
window
and
threw
himself
into
a
chair
gazing
at
those
in
the
room
as
if
asking
why
do
they
look
at
me
then
he
lifted
his
head
stretched
his
neck
as
if
he
intended
to
say
some
thing
but
immediately
with
affected
indiffer
ence
began
to
hum
to
himself
producing
a
queer
sound
which
immediately
broke
off
.
the
door
of
the
private
room
opened
and
kutu
zov
appeared
in
the
doorway
.
the
general
with
the
bandaged
head
bent
forward
as
though
run
ning
away
from
some
danger
and
making
long
quick
strides
with
his
thin
legs
went
up
to
kutiizov
.
vous
voyez
le
malheureux
mack
he
ut
tered
in
a
broken
voice
.
kutiizovs
face
as
he
stood
in
the
open
door
way
remained
perfectly
immobile
for
a
few
mo
ments
.
then
wrinkles
ran
over
his
face
like
a
wave
and
his
forehead
became
smooth
again
he
bowed
his
head
respectfully
closed
his
eyes
silently
let
mack
enter
his
room
before
him
and
closed
the
door
himself
behind
him
.
the
report
which
had
been
circulated
that
the
austrians
had
been
beaten
and
that
the
whole
army
had
surrendered
at
ulm
proved
to
be
correct
.
within
half
an
hour
adjutants
had
been
sent
in
various
directions
with
orders
which
showed
that
the
russian
troops
who
had
hitherto
been
inactive
would
also
soon
have
to
meet
the
enemy
.
prince
andrew
was
one
of
those
rare
staff
officers
whose
chief
interest
lay
in
the
general
progress
of
the
war
.
when
he
saw
mack
and
heard
the
details
of
his
disaster
he
understood
that
half
the
campaign
was
lost
understood
all
the
difficulties
of
the
russian
armys
position
and
vividly
imagined
what
awaited
it
and
the
part
he
would
have
to
play
.
involuntarily
he
felt
a
joyful
agitation
at
the
thought
of
the
hu
miliation
of
arrogant
austria
and
that
in
a
weeks
time
he
might
perhaps
see
and
take
part
in
the
first
russian
encounter
with
the
french
since
suv6rovmet
them
.
he
feared
that
bonapartes
genius
might
outweigh
all
the
cour
age
of
the
russian
troops
and
at
the
same
time
could
not
admit
the
idea
of
his
hero
being
dis
graced
.
excited
and
irritated
by
these
thoughts
prince
andrew
went
toward
his
room
to
write
to
his
father
to
whom
he
wrote
every
day
.
in
the
corridor
he
met
nesvftski
with
whom
he
shared
a
room
and
the
wag
zherk6v
they
were
as
usual
laughing
.

are

asked
nesvitski
no
ticing
prince
andrews
pale
face
and
glittering
eyes
.
theres
nothing
to
be
gay
about
answered
bolk6nski
.
just
as
prince
andrew
met
nesvftski
and
zherk6v
there
came
toward
them
from
the
oth
er
end
of
the
corridor
strauch
an
austrian
general
who
was
on
kutiizovs
staff
in
charge
of
the
provisioning
of
the
russian
army
and
the
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
who
had
arrived
the
previous
evening
.
there
was
room
enough
in
the
wide
corridor
for
the
generals
to
pass
the
three
officers
quite
easily
but
zherk6v
push
ing
nesvitski
aside
with
his

said
in
a

the
generals
were
passing
by
looking
as
if
they
wished
to
avoid
embarrassing
attentions
.
on
the
face
of
the
wag
zherk6v
there
sudden
ly
appeared
a
stupid
smile
of
glee
which
he
seemed
unable
to
suppress
.
your
excellency
said
he
in
german
step
ping
forward
and
addressing
the
austrian
general
i
have
the
honor
to
congratulate
you
.
he
bowed
his
head
and
scraped
first
with
one
foot
and
then
with
the
other
awkwardly
like
a
child
at
a
dancing
lesson
.
the
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
looked
at
him
severely
but
seeing
the
seriousness
of
his
stupid
smile
could
not
but
give
him
a
moments
attention
.
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
showing
that
he
was
listening
.
i
have
the
honor
to
congratulate
you
.

a

he
added
pointing
with
a
beaming
smile
to
his
head
.
the
general
frowned
turned
away
and
went
on
.
gott
wie
naiv

said
he
angrily
after
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
.
nesvftski
with
a
laugh
threw
his
arms
round
prince
andrew
but
bolk6nski
turning
still
paler
pushed
him
away
with
an
angry
look
and
turned
to
zherkov
.
the
nervous
irritation
aroused
by
the
appearance
of
mack
the
news
of
his
defeat
and
the
thought
of
what
lay
be
fore
the
russian
army
found
vent
in
anger
at
zherk6vs
untimely
jest
.
if
you
sir
choose
to
make
a
buffoon
of
your
self
he
said
sharply
with
a
slight
trembling
of
the
lower
jaw
i
cant
prevent
your
doing
so
but
i
warn
you
that
if
you
dare
to
play
the
1
good
god
what
simplicity
fool
in
my
presence
i
will
teach
you
to
behave
yourself
.
nesvitski
and
zherk6v
were
so
surprised
by
this
outburst
that
they
gazed
at
bolk6nski
si
lently
with
wideopen
eyes
.
whats
the
matter
i
only
congratulated
them
said
zherkov
.
i
am
not
jestingwith
you
please
be
silent
cried
bolk6nski
and
taking
nesvf
tskis
arm
he
left
zherkov
who
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
come
whats
the
matter
old
fellow
said
nesvftski
trying
to
soothe
him
.
whats
the
matter
exclaimed
prince
an
drew
standing
still
in
his
excitement
.
dont
you
understand
that
either
we
are
officers
serv
ing
our
tsar
and
our
country
rejoicing
in
the
successes
and
grieving
at
the
misfortunes
of
our
common
cause
or
we
are
merely
lackeys
who
care
nothing
for
their

noticed
that

could
still

he

to

whether

would

he
turned

with

whom
all
the

knew
for
a
rogue

lavrushka
brought

said
he
.
now
for
trou
ble
rost6v
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
denfsov
coming
home
.
denfsov
was
a
small
man
with
a
red
face
sparkling
black
eyes
and
black
tousled
mustache
and
hair
.
he
wore
an
unfastened
cloak
wide
breeches
hanging
down
in
creases
and
a
crumpled
shako
on
the
back
of
his
head
.
he
came
up
to
the
porch
gloomily
hanging
his
head
.

he
shouted
loudly
and
angrily
take

lavrushkas

as
soon
as
you
left
it
began
and
went
on
.
hullo
there
tea
puckering
up
his
face
as
though
smiling
and
showing
his
short
strong
teeth
he
began
with
stubby
fingers
of
both
hands
to
ruffle
up
his
thick
tangled
black
hair
.
and
what
devil
made
me
go
to
that
wat
an
officer
nicknamed
the
rat
he
said
rub
bing
his
forehead
and
whole
face
with
both
hands
.
just
fancy
he
didnt
let
me
win
a
sin
gle
cahd
not
one
cahd
.
he
took
the
lighted
pipe
that
was
offered
to
him
gripped
it
in
his
fist
and
tapped
it
on
the
floor
making
the
sparks
fly
while
he
continued
to
shout
.
he
lets
one
win
the
singles
and
collahs
it
as
soon
as
one
doubles
it
gives
the
singles
and
snatches
the
doubles
he
scattered
the
burning
tobacco
smashed
the
pipe
and
threw
it
away
.
then
he
remained
silent
for
a
while
and
all
at
once
looked
cheer
fully
with
his
glittering
black
eyes
at
rost6v
.
if
at
least
we
had
some
women
here
but
war
and
peace
theres
nothing
foh
one
to
do
but
dwink
.
if
we
could
only
get
to
fighting
soon
.
hullo
whos
there
he
said
turning
to
the
door
as
he
heard
a
tread
of
heavy
boots
and
the
clinking
of
spurs
that
came
to
a
stop
and
a
respectful
cough
.
the
squadron
quartermaster

said
la

denlsovs
face
puckered
still
more
.
wetched

muttered
throwing
down
a
purse
with
some
gold
in
it
.

he
said
and
went
out
to
the
quartermaster
.
rost6v
took
the
money
and
mechanically
ar
ranging
the
old
and
new
coins
in
separate
piles
began
counting
them
.
ah
telydnin
how
dye
do
they
plucked
me
last
night
came
denisovs
voice
from
the
next
room
.
where
at
bykovs
at
the
rats

..
.
i
knew
it
replied
a
piping
voice
and
lieutenant
tel
ydnin
a
small
officer
of
the
same
squadron
en
tered
the
room
.
rost6v
thrust
the
purse
under
the
pillow
and
shook
the
damp
little
hand
which
was
offered
him
.
telydnin
for
some
reason
had
been
trans
ferred
from
the
guards
just
before
this
cam
paign
.
he
behaved
very
well
in
the
regiment
but
was
not
liked
rost6v
especially
detested
him
and
was
unable
to
overcome
or
conceal
his
groundless
antipathy
to
the
man
.
well
young
cavalryman
how
is
my
rook
behaving
he
asked
.
rook
was
a
young
horse
telydnin
had
sold
to
rost6v
.
the
lieutenant
never
looked
the
man
he
was
speaking
to
straight
in
the
face
his
eyes
con
tinually
wandered
from
one
object
to
another
.
i
saw
you
riding
this
morn
ing

.

.

.
he
added
.
oh
hes
all
right
a
good
horse
answered
rost6v
though
the
horse
for
which
he
had
paid
seven
hundred
rubbles
was
not
worth
half
that
sum
.
hes
begun
to
go
a
little
lame
on
the
left
foreleg
he
added
.
the
hoofs
cracked
thats
nothing
.
ill
teach
you
what
to
do
and
show
you
what
kind
of
rivet
to
use
.
yes
please
do
said
rost6v
.
ill
show
you
ill
show
you
its
not
a
secret
.
and
its
a
horse
youll
thank
me
for
.
then
ill
have
it
brought
round
said
ros
t6v
wishing
to
avoid
telydnin
and
he
went
out
to
give
the
order
.
in
the
passage
denisov
with
a
pipe
was
squatting
on
the
threshold
facing
the
quarter
master
who
was
reporting
to
him
.
on
seeing
rost6v
denfsov
screwed
up
his
face
and
point
ing
of
er
his
shoulder
with
his
thumb
to
the
room
where
telydnin
was
sitting
he
frowned
and
gave
a
shudder
of
disgust
.
ugh
i
dont
like
that
fellow
he
said
re
gardless
of
the
quartermasters
presence
.
rost6v
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
much
as
to
say
nor
do
1
but
whats
one
to
do
and
having
given
his
order
he
returned
to
telyd
nin
.
telydnin
was
sitting
in
the
same
indolent
pose
in
which
rostov
had
left
him
rubbing
his
small
white
hands
.
well
there
certainly
are
disgusting
people
thought
rost6v
as
he
entered
.
have
you
told
them
to
bring
the
horse
asked
telydnin
getting
up
and
looking
care
lessly
about
him
.
i
have
.
let
us
go
ourselves
.
i
only
came
round
to
ask
denisov
about
yesterdays
order
.
have
you
got
it
denisov
not
yet
.
but
where
are
you
off
to
i
want
to
teach
this
young
man
how
to
shoe
a
horse
said
telydnin
.
they
went
through
the
porch
and
into
the
stable
.
the
lieutenant
explained
how
to
rivet
the
hoof
and
went
away
to
his
own
quarters
.
when
rostov
went
back
there
was
a
bottle
of
vodka
and
a
sausage
on
the
table
.
denfsov
was
sitting
there
scratching
with
his
pen
on
a
sheet
of
paper
.
he
looked
gloomily
in
rost6vs
face
and
said
i
am
witing
to
her
.
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
with
his
pen
in
his
hand
and
evidently
glad
of
a
chance
to
say
quicker
in
words
what
he
wanted
to
write
told
rost6v
the
contents
of
his
letter
.
you
see
my
fwiend
he
said
we
sleep
when
we
dont
love
.
we
are
childwen
of
the
dust

.

.

.
but
one
falls
in
love
and
one

one

.

he
shouted
to
lavrushka
who
went
up
to
him
not
in
the
least
abashed
.
who
should

be
you
yourself
told
him
to
come
.
its

quartermaster
for

.
denisov
frowned
and
was
about
to
shout
some
reply
but
stopped
.
wetched

he
muttered
to
himself
.
how
much

asked
turning
to
rost6v
.

rost6v
blushing

the
pillow
.

.

and

it
just
here
.
where
is
it
he
asked
turning
to
lavni
shka
.
i
havent
been
in
the
room
.
it
must
be
where
you
put
it
.
but
it
isnt

.

.

.
youre
always
like
that
you
thwow
a
thing
down
anywhere
and
forget
it
.
feel
in
your
pockets
.
no
if
i
hadnt
thought
of
it
being
a
treas
ure
said
rostov
but
i
remember
putting
it
there
.
lavrtishka
turned
all
the
bftkling
over
looked
under
the
bed
and
under
the
table
searched
everywhere
and
stood
still
in
the
mid
dle
of
the
room
.
denisov
silently
watched
la
vrushkas
movements
and
when
the
latter
threw
up
his
arms
in
surprise
saying
it
was
no
where
to
be
found
denisov
glanced
at
rost6v
.
wost6v
youve
not
been
playing
schoolboy
twicks
.

.

.

.
rost6v
felt
denf
sovs
gaze
fixed
on
him
raised
his
eyes
and
instantly
dropped
them
again
.
all
the
blood
which
had
seemed
congested
some
where
below
his
throat
rushed
to
his
face
and
eyes
.
he
could
not
draw
breath
.
and
there
hasnt
been
anyone
in
the
room
except
the
lieutenant
and
yourselves
.
it
must
be
here
somewhere
said
lavrtishka
.
now
then
you
devils
puppet
look
alive
and
hunt
for
it
shouted
denfsov
suddenly
turning
purple
and
rushing
at
the
man
with
a
threatening
gesture
.
if
the
purse
isnt
found
ill
flog
you
ill
flog
you
all
.
rost6v
his
eyes
avoiding
denisov
began
buttoning
his
coat
buckled
on
his
saber
and
put
on
his
cap
.
i
must
have
that
purse
i
tell
you
shouted
denfsov
shaking
his
orderly
by
the
shoulders
and
knocking
him
against
the
wall
.
denfsov
let
him
alone
i
know
who
has
taken
it
said
rost6v
going
toward
the
door
without
raising
his
eyes
.
denisov
paused
thought
a
moment
and
evidently
understand
ing
what
rost6v
hinted
at
seized
his
arm
.
nonsense
he
cried
and
the
veins
on
his
forehead
and
neck
stood
out
like
cords
.
you
are
mad
i
tell
you
.
i
wont
allow
it
.
the
purse
is
here
ill
flay
this
scoundwel
alive
and
it
will
be
found
.
i
know
who
has
taken
it
repeated
rost6v
in
an
unsteady
voice
and
went
to
the
door
.
and
i
tell
you
dont
you
dahe
to
do
it
shouted
denfsov
rushing
at
the
cadet
to
re
strain
him
.
but
rost6v
pulled
away
his
arm
and
with
as
much
anger
as
though
denfsov
were
his
worst
enemy
firmly
fixed
his
eyes
directly
on
his
face
.
do
you
understand
what
youre
saying
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
.
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
except
myself
.
so
that
if
it
is
not
so
then

.

.

.
he
could
not
finish
and
ran
out
of
the
room
.
ah
may
the
devil
take
you
and
evewybody
were
the
last
words
rost6v
heard
.
rostov
went
to
telynins
quarters
.
the
master
is
not
in
hes
gone
to
head
quarters
said
telydnins
orderly
.
has
some
thing
happened
he
added
surprised
at
the
cadets
troubled
face
.
no
nothing
.
youve
only
just
missed
him
said
the
or
derly
.
the
headquarters
were
situated
two
miles
away
from
salzeneck
and
rost6v
without
re
turning
home
took
a
horse
and
rode
there
.
there
was
an
inn
in
the
village
which
the
of
ficers
frequented
.
rost6v
rode
up
to
it
and
saw
telyan
ins
horse
at
the
porch
.
in
the
second
room
of
the
inn
the
lieuten
ant
was
sitting
over
a
dish
of
sausages
and
a
bottle
of
wine
.
ah
youve
come
here
too
young
man
he
said
smiling
and
raising
his
eyebrows
.
yes
said
rost6v
as
if
it
cost
him
a
great
deal
to
utter
the
word
and
he
sat
down
at
the
nearest
table
.
both
were
silent
.
there
were
two
germans
and
a
russian
officer
in
the
room
.
no
one
spoke
and
the
only
sounds
heard
were
the
clatter
of
knives
and
the
munching
of
the
lieutenant
.
war
and
peace
when
telydnin
had
finished
his
lunch
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
double
purse
and
drawing
its
rings
aside
with
his
small
white
turnedup
fingers
drew
out
a
gold
imperial
and
lifting
his
eyebrows
gave
it
to
the
waiter
.
please
be
quick
he
said
.
the
coin
was
a
new
one
.
rost6v
rose
and
went
up
to
telydnin
.
allow
me
to
look
at
your
purse
he
said
in
a
low
almost
inaudible
voice
.
with
shifting
eyes
but
eyebrows
still
raised
telydnin
handed
him
the
purse
.
yes
its
a
nice
purse
.
yes
yes
he
said
grow
ing
suddenly
pale
and
added
look
at
it
young
man
.
rost6v
took
the
purse
in
his
hand
examined
it
and
the
money
in
it
and
looked
at
telydnin
.
the
lieutenant
was
looking
about
in
his
usual
way
and
suddenly
seemed
to
grow
very
merry
.
if
we
get
to
vienna
ill
get
rid
of
it
there
but
in
these
wretched
little
towns
theres
no
where
to
spend
it
said
he
.
well
let
me
have
it
young
man
im
going
.
rost6v
did
not
speak
.
and
you
are
you
going
to
have
lunch
too
they
feed
you
quite
decently
here
continued
telydnin
.
now
then
let
me
have
it
.
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
take
hold
of
the
purse
.
rost6v
let
go
of
it
.
telyinin
took
the
purse
and
began
carelessly
slipping
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
riding
breeches
with
his
eyebrows
lifted
and
his
mouth
slightly
open
as
if
to
say
yes
yes
i
am
putting
my
purse
in
my
pocket
and
thats
quite
simple
and
is
no
one
elses
busi
ness
.
well
young
man
he
said
with
a
sigh
and
from
under
his
lifted
brows
he
glanced
into
rost6vs
eyes
.
some
flash
as
of
an
electric
spark
shot
from
telydnins
eyes
to
rost6vs
and
back
and
back
again
and
again
in
an
instant
.
come
here
said
rostdv
catching
hold
of
telydnins
arm
and
almost
dragging
him
to
the
window
.
that
money
is
denisovs
you
took
it

.

.

.
he
whispered
just
above
telydnins
ear
.
what
what
how
dare
you
what
said
telyinin
.
but
these
words
came
like
a
piteous
despair
ing
cry
and
an
entreaty
for
pardon
.
as
soon
as
rost6v
heard
them
an
enormous
load
of
doubt
fell
from
him
.
he
was
glad
and
at
the
same
in
stant
began
to
pity
the
miserable
man
who
stood
before
him
but
the
task
he
had
begun
had
to
be
completed
.
heaven
only
knows
what
the
people
here
may
imagine
muttered
telydnin
taking
up
his
cap
and
moving
toward
a
small
empty
room
.
we
must
have
an
explanation

.

.

.
i
know
it
and
shall
prove
it
said
rost6v
.
i

.

.

.
every
muscle
of
telydnins
pale
terrified
face
began
to
quiver
his
eyes
still
shifted
from
side
to
side
but
with
a
downward
look
not
ris
ing
to
rost6vs
face
and
his
sobs
were
audible
.
countl

.

.

.
dont
ruin
a
young
fellow

.

.

.
here
is
this
wretched
money
take
it

.

.

.
he
threw
it
on
the
table
.
i
have
an
old
father
and
mother

.

.

.
rostcw
took
the
money
avoiding
telynins
eyes
and
went
out
of
the
room
without
a
word
.
but
at
the
door
he
stopped
and
then
retraced
his
steps
.
o
god
he
said
with
tears
in
his
eyes
how
could
you
do
it
count

.

.

.
said
telydnin
drawing
nearer
to
him
.
dont
touch
me
said
rost6vdrawingback
.
if
you
need
it
take
the
money
and
he
threw
the
purse
to
him
and
ran
out
of
the
inn
.
chapter
v
that
same
evening
there
was
an
animated
dis
cussion
among
the
squadrons
officers
in
denf
sovs
quarters
.
and
i
tell
you
rost6v
that
you
must
apol
ogize
to
the
colonel
said
a
tall
grizzlyhaired
staff
captain
with
enormous
mustaches
and
many
wrinkles
on
his
large
features
to
rost6v
who
was
crimson
with
excitement
.
the
staff
captain
kfrsten
had
twice
been
reduced
to
the
ranks
for
affairs
of
honor
and
had
twice
regained
his
commission
.
i
will
allow
no
one
to
call
me
a
liar
cried
rost6v
.
he
told
me
i
lied
and
i
told
him
he
lied
.
and
there
it
rests
.
he
may
keep
me
on
duty
every
day
or
may
place
me
under
arrest
but
no
one
can
make
me
apologize
because
if
he
as
commander
of
this
regiment
thinks
it
beneath
his
dignity
to
give
me
satisfaction
then

.

.

.
you
just
wait
a
moment
my
dear
fellow
and
listen
interrupted
the
staff
captain
in
his
deep
bass
calmly
stroking
his
long
mustache
.
you
tell
the
colonel
in
the
presence
of
other
officers
that
an
officer
has
stolen

.

.

.
im
not
to
blame
that
the
conversation
be
gan
in
the
presence
of
other
officers
.
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
spoken
before
them
but
i
am
not
a
diplomatist
.
thats
why
i
joined
the
hussars
thinking
that
here
one
would
not
need
finesse
and
he
tells
me
that
i
am
lying
so
let
him
give
me
satisfaction

.

.

.
book
two
thats
all
right
.
no
one
thinks
you
a
coward
but
thats
not
the
point
.
ask
denfsov
whether
it
is
not
out
of
the
question
for
a
cadet
to
de
mand
satisfaction
of
his
regimental
command
er
denisov
sat
gloomily
biting
his
mustache
and
listening
to
the
conversation
evidently
with
no
wish
to
take
part
in
it
.
he
answered
the
staff
captains
question
by
a
disapproving
shake
of
his
head
.
you
speak
to
the
colonel
about
this
nasty
business
before
other
officers
continued
the
staff
captain
and
bogddnich
the
colonel
was
called
bogdanich
shuts
you
up
.
he
did
not
shut
me
up
he
said
i
was
tell
ing
an
untruth
.
well
have
it
so
and
you
talked
a
lot
of
nonsense
to
him
and
must
apologize
.
not
on
any
account
exclaimed
rost6v
.
i
did
not
expect
this
of
you
said
the
staff
captain
seriously
and
severely
.
you
dont
wish
to
apologize
but
man
its
not
only
to
him
but
to
the
whole
regiment
all
of
us
youre
to
blame
all
round
.
the
case
is
this
you
ought
to
have
thought
the
matter
over
and
taken
advice
but
no
you
go
and
blurt
it
all
straight
out
be
fore
the
officers
.
now
what
was
the
colonel
to
do
have
the
officer
tried
and
disgrace
the
whole
regiment
disgrace
the
whole
regiment
because
of
one
scoundrel
is
that
how
you
look
at
it
we
dont
see
it
like
that
.
and
bogdanich
was
a
brick
he
told
you
you
were
saying
what
was
not
true
.
its
not
pleasant
but
whats
to
be
done
my
dear
fellow
you
landed
yourself
in
it
.
and
now
when
one
wants
to
smooth
the
thing
over
some
conceit
prevents
your
apolo
gizing
and
you
wish
to
make
the
whole
affair
public
.
you
are
offended
at
being
put
on
duty
a
bit
but
why
not
apologize
to
an
old
and
hon
orable
officer
whatever
bogdanich
may
be
anyway
he
is
an
honorable
and
brave
old
colo
nel
youre
quick
at
taking
offense
but
you
dont
mind
disgracing
the
whole
regiment
1
the
staff
captains
voice
began
to
tremble
.
you
have
been
in
the
regiment
next
to
no
time
my
lad
youre
here
today
and
tomorrow
youll
be
appointed
adjutant
somewhere
and
can
snap
your
fingers
when
it
is
said
there
are
thieves
among
the
pdvlograd
officers
but
its
not
all
the
same
to
us
am
i
not
right
denisov
its
not
the
same
denfsov
remained
silent
and
did
not
move
but
occasionally
looked
with
his
glittering
black
eyes
at
rost6v
.
you
value
your
own
pride
and
dont
wish
to
apologize
continued
the
staff
captain
but
73
we
old
fellows
who
have
grown
up
in
and
god
willing
are
going
to
die
in
the
regiment
we
prize
the
honor
of
the
regiment
and
bog
dnich
knows
it
.
oh
we
do
prize
it

fel
low
and
all
this
is
not
right
its
not
right
you
may
take
offense
or
not
but
i
always
stick
to
mother
truth
.
its
not
right
and
the
staff
captain
rose
and
turned
away
from
rost6v

denfsov

wost6v
now

and

at

then
at
the

denfsov

braunau
and
traun
near
linz
.
on
october
23
the
russian
troops
were
crossing
tfye
river
enns
.
at
midday
the
russian
baggage
train
the
artillery
and
columns
of
troops
were
de
filing
through
the
town
of
enns
on
both
sides
of
the
bridge
.
it
was
a
warm
rainy
autumnal
day
.
the
wide
expanse
that
opened
out
before
the
heights
on
which
the
russian
batteries
stood
guarding
the
bridge
was
at
times
veiled
by
a
diaphanous
curtain
of
slanting
rain
and
then
suddenly
spread
out
in
the
sunlight
fardistant
objects
could
be
clearly
seen
glittering
as
though
fresh
ly
varnished
.
down
below
the
little
town
could
be
seen
with
its
white
redroofed
houses
its
cathedral
and
its
bridge
on
both
sides
of
which
streamed
jostling
masses
of
russian
troops
.
at
the
bend
of
the
danube
vessels
an
island
and
a
castle
with
a
park
surrounded
by
the
waters
of
the
confluence
of
the
enns
and
the
danube
became
visible
and
the
rocky
left
bank
of
the
danube
covered
with
pine
forests
with
a
mystic
background
of
green
treetops
and
bluish
gor
ges
.
the
turrets
of
a
convent
stood
out
beyond
a
wild
virgin
pine
forest
and
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
enns
the
enemys
horse
patrols
could
be
discerned
.
among
the
field
guns
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
general
in
command
of
the
rearguard
stood
with
a
staff
officer
scanning
the
country
through
his
fieldglass
.
a
little
behind
them
nesvftski
who
had
been
sent
to
the
rearguard
by
the
com
maivder
in
chief
was
sitting
on
the
trail
of
a
gun
carriage
.
a
cossack
who
accompanied
him
had
handed
him
a
knapsack
and
a
flask
and
nesvf
tski
was
treating
some
officers
to
pies
and
real
doppelkummel
.
the
officers
gladly
gath
ered
round
him
some
on
their
knees
some
squatting
turkish
fashion
on
the
wet
grass
.
yes
the
austrian
prince
who
built
that
cas
tle
was
no
fool
.
its
a
fine
place
why
are
you
not
eating
any
thing
gentlemen
nesvitski
was
saying
.
thank
you
very
much
prince
answered
one
of
the
officers
pleased
to
be
talking
to
a
staff
officer
of
such
importance
.
its
a
lovely
place
we
passed
close
to
the
park
and
saw
two
deer

.

.

.
and
what
a
splendid
house
look
prince
said
another
who
would
have
dearly
liked
to
take
another
pie
but
felt
shy
and
therefore
pretended
to
be
examining
the
countryside
see
our
infantrymen
have
already
got
there
.
look
there
in
the
meadow
behind
the
village
three
of
them
are
dragging
something
.
theyll
ransack
that
castle
he
re
marked
with
evident
approval
.
so
they
will
said
nesvitski
.
no
but
what
i
should
like
added
he
munching
a
pie
in
his
moistlipped
handsome
mouth
would
be
to
slip
in
over
there
.
he
pointed
with
a
smile
to
a
turreted
nun
nery
and
his
eyes
narrowed
and
gleamed
.
that
would
be
fine
gentlemen
the
officers
laughed
.
just
to
flutter
the
nuns
a
bit
.
they
say
there
are
italian
girls
among
them
.
on
my
word
id
give
five
years
of
my
life
for
it
they
must
be
feeling
dull
too
said
one
of
the
bolder
officers
laughing
.
meanwhile
the
staff
officer
standing
in
front
pointed
out
something
to
the
general
who
looked
through
his
field
glass
.
yes
so
it
is
so
it
is
said
the
general
an
grily
lowering
the
field
glass
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
so
it
is
theyll
be
fired
on
at
the
crossing
.
and
why
are
they
dawdling
there
on
the
opposite
side
the
enemy
could
be
seen
by
the
naked
eye
and
from
their
battery
a
milkwhite
cloud
arose
.
then
came
the
distant
report
of
a
shot
and
our
troops
could
be
seen
hurrying
to
the
crossing
.
nesvftski
rose
puffing
and
went
up
to
the
general
smiling
.
would
not
your
excellency
like
a
little
re
freshment
he
said
.
its
a
bad
business
said
the
general
with
out
answering
him
our
men
have
been
wast
ing

hadnt
i
better
ride
over
your
excellency
asked
nesvitski
.
yes
please
do
answered
the
general
and
he
repeated
the
order
that
had
already
once
been
given
in
detail
and
tell
the
hussars
that
they
are
to
cross
last
and
to
fire
the
bridge
as
i
ordered
and
the
inflammable
material
on
the
bridge
must
be
reinspected
.
very
good
answered
nesvftski
.
he
called
the
cossack
with
his
horse
told
him
to
put
away
the
knapsack
and
flask
and
swung
his
heavy
person
easily
into
the
saddle
.
ill
really
call
in
on
the
nuns
he
said
to
the
officers
who
watched
him
smilingly
and
he
rode
off
by
the
winding
path
down
the
hill
.
now
then
lets
see
how
far
it
will
carry
captain
.
just

said
the
general
turning
to
an
artillery
officer
.

the
of

in
a
moment
the
men
came
running
gaily
from
their
campfires
and
began
loading
.
one
came
the
command
.
number
one
jumped
briskly
aside
.
the
gun
rang
out
with
a
deafening
metallic
roar
and
a
whistling
grenade
flew
above
the
heads
of
our
troops
below
the
hill
and
fell
far
short
of
the
enemy
a
little
smoke
showing
the
spot
where
it
burst
.
the
faces
of
officers
and
men
brightened
up
at
the
sound
.
everyone
gotupand
began
watch
ing
the
movements
of
our
troops
below
as
plainly
visible
as
if
but
a
stones
throw
away
and
the
movements
of
the
approaching
enemy
farther
off
.
at
the
same
instant
the
sun
came
fully
out
from
behind
the
clouds
and
the
clear
sound
of
the
solitary
shot
and
the
brilliance
of
the
bright
sunshine
merged
in
a
single
joyous
and
spirited
impression
.
chapter
vii
two
of
the
enemys
shots
had
already
flown
across
the
bridge
where
there
was
a
crush
.
half
way
across
stood
prince
nesvitski
who
had
alighted
from
his
horse
and
whose
big
body
was
jammed
against
the
railings
.
he
looked
back
laughing
to
the
cossack
who
stood
a
few
steps
behind
him
holding
two
horses
by
their
bridles
.
each
time
prince
nesvftski
tried
to
move
on
soldiers
and
carts
pushed
him
back
again
and
pressed
him
against
the
railings
and
all
he
could
do
was
to
smile
.
what
a
fellow
you
are
friend
said
the
cossack
to
a
convoy
soldier
with
a
wagon
who
was
pressing
onto
the
infantrymen
who
were
crowded
together
close
to
his
wheels
and
his
horses
.
what
a
fellow
you
cant
wait
a
mo
ment
dont
you
see
the
general
wants
to
pass
but
the
convoyman
took
no
notice
of
the
word
general
and
shouted
at
the
soldiers
who
were
blocking
his
way
.
hi
there
boys
keep
to
the
left
wait
a
bit
.
but
the
soldiers
crowded
together
shoulder
to
shoulder
their
bayonets
interlocking
moved
over
the
bridge
in
a
dense
mass
.
looking
down
over
the
rails
prince
nesvftski
saw
the
rapid
noisy
little
waves
of
the
enns
which
rippling
and
eddying
round
the
piles
of
the
bridge
chased
each
other
along
.
looking
on
the
bridge
he
saw
equally
uniform
living
waves
of
soldiers
shoulder
straps
covered
shakos
knapsacks
bayonets
long
muskets
and
under
the
shakos
faces
with
broad
cheekbones
sunken
cheeks
and
listless
tired
expressions
and
feet
that
moved
through
the
sticky
mud
that
covered
the
planks
of
the
bridge
.
sometimes
through
the
monotonous
waves
of
men
like
a
fleck
of
white
foam
on
the
waves
of
the
enns
an
officer
in
a
cloak
and
with
a
type
of
face
different
from
that
of
the
men
squeezed
his
way
along
sometimes
like
a
chip
of
wood
whirling
in
the
river
an
hussar
on
foot
an
orderly
or
a
townsman
was
carried
through
the
waves
of
infantry
and
sometimes
like
a
log
floating
down
the
river
an
officers
or
companys
baggage
wagon
piled
high
leather
covered
and
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
moved
across
the
bridge
.
its
as
if
a
dam
had
burst
said
the
cossack
hopelessly
.
are
there
many
more
of
you
to
come
a
million
all
but
one
replied
a
waggish
soldier
in
a
torn
coat
with
a
wink
and
passed
on
followed
by
another
an
old
man
.
if
he
he
meant
the
enemy
begins
pop
ping
at
the
bridge
now
said
the
old
soldier
dismally
to
a
comrade
youll
forget
to
scratch
yourself
.
that
soldier
passed
on
and
after
him
came
another
sitting
on
a
cart
.
where
the
devil
have
the
leg
bands
been
shoved
to
said
an
orderly
running
behind
the
cart
and
fumbling
in
the
back
of
it
.
and
he
also
passed
on
with
the
wagon
.
then
came
some
merry
soldiers
who
had
evidently
been
drinking
.
and
then
old
fellow
he
gives
him
one
in
the
teeth
with
the
butt
end
of
his
gun

..
.
a
soldier
whose
greatcoat
was
well
tucked
up
said
gaily
with
a
wide
swing
of
his
arm
.
yes
the
ham
was
just
delicious

.

an

with
a
loud
laugh

war
and
peace
too
passed
on
so
that
nesvftski
did
not
learn
who
had
been
struck
on
the
teeth
or
what
the
ham
had
to
do
with
it
.
bah
how
they
scurry
.
he
just
sends
a
ball
and
they
think
theyll
all
be
killed
a
sergeant
was
saying
angrfly
and
reproachfully
.
as
it
flies
past
me
daddy
the
ball
i
mean
said
a
young
soldier
with
an
enormous
mouth
hardly
refraining
from
laughing
i
felt
like
dying
of
fright
.
i
did
pon
my
word
i
got
that
frightened
i
said
he
as
if
bragging
of
having
been
frightened
.
that
one
also
passed
.
then
followed
a
cart
unlike
any
that
had
gone
before
.
it
was
a
ger
man
cart
with
a
pair
of
horses
led
by
a
german
and
seemed
loaded
with
a
whole
houseful
of
effects
.
a
fine
brindled
cow
with
a
large
udder
was
attached
to
the
cart
behind
.
a
woman
with
an
unweaned
baby
an
old
woman
and
a
healthy
german
girl
with
bright
red
cheeks
were
sitting
on
some
feather
beds
.
evidently
these
fugitives
were
allowed
to
pass
by
special
permission
.
the
eyes
of
all
the
soldiers
turned
toward
the
women
and
while
the
vehicle
was
passing
at
foot
pace
all
the
soldiers
remarks
re
lated
to
the
two
young
ones
.
every
face
bore
almost
the
same
smile
expressing
unseemly
thoughts
about
the
women
.
just
see
the
german
sausage
is
making
tracks
tool
sell
me
the
missis
said
another
soldier
ad
dressing
the
german
who
angry
and
fright
ened
strode
energetically
along
with
downcast
eyes
.
see
how
smart
shes
made
herself
oh
the
devilsl
there
fed6tovyou
should
be
quartered
on
them
i
have
seen
as
much
before
now
mate
where
are
you
going
asked
an
infantry
officer
who
was
eating
an
apple
also
half
smil
ing
as
he
looked
at
the
handsome
girl
.
the
german
closed
his
eyes
signifying
that
he
did
not
understand
.
take
it
if
you
like
said
the
officer
giving
the
girl
an
apple
.
the
girl
smiled
and
took
it
.
nesvftski
like
the
rest
of
the
men
on
the
bridge
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
women
till
they
had
passed
.
when
they
had
gone
by
the
same
stream
of
soldiers
followed
with
the
same
kind
of
talk
and
at
last
all
stopped
.
as
often
happens
the
horses
of
a
convoy
wagon
became
restive
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
and
the
whole
crowd
had
to
wait
.
and
why
are
they
stopping
theres
no
proper
order
said
the
soldiers
.
where
are
you
shoving
to
devil
take
you
cant
you
wait
itll
be
worse
if
he
fires
the
bridge
.
see
heres
an
officer
jammed
in
too
different
voices
were
saying
in
the
crowd
as
the
men
looked
at
one
another
and
all
pressed
toward
the
exit
from
the
bridge
.
looking
down
at
the
waters
of
the
enns
under
the
bridge
nesvftski
suddenly
heard
a
sound
new
to
him
of
something
swiftly
ap
proaching

.

.

.
something
big
that
splashed
in
to
the
water
.
just
see
where
it
carries
to
a
soldier
near
by
said
sternly
looking
round
at
the
sound
.
encouraging
us
to
get
along
quicker
said
another
uneasily
.
the
crowd
moved
on
again
.
nesvftski
re
alized
that
it
was
a
cannon
ball
.
hey
cossack
my
horse
he
said
.
now
then
you
there
get
out
of
theway
makeway
with
great
difficulty
he
managed
to
get
to
his
horse
and
shouting
continually
he
moved
on
.
the
soldiers
squeezed
themselves
to
make
way
for
him
but
again
pressed
on
him
so
that
they
jammed
his
leg
and
those
nearest
him
were
not
to
blame
for
they
were
themselves
pressed
still
harder
from
behind
.
nesvftski
nesvftski
you
numskull
came
a
hoarse
voice
from
behind
him
.
nesvftski
looked
round
and
saw

paces
away

by
the
living
mass

.

shouted
denfsov
evidently
in
a
fit
of
rage
his
coalblack
eyes
with
their
bloodshot
whites
glittering
and
rolling
as
he
waved
his
sheathed
saber
in
a
small
bare
hand
as
red
as
his
face
.
ah

joyfully
replied
nesvftski
.

showing
his

fiercely
and
spurring
his

which
twitched
its
ears
as
the
bayonets
touched
it
and
snorted

white
foam
from
his
bit
tramping
the
planks
of
the
bridge
with
his
hoofs
and
apparently
ready
to
jump
over
the
railings

his
rider

the
soldiers
crowded
against

with
terrified
faces
and

denisov
smiled
took
out
of
his

a

that
diffused
a
smell
of

and
put
it
to

the
imposing
figure
of
nesvitski
followed
by
his
cossack
and
the
determination
of
deni
sov
who
flourished
his
sword
and
shouted
fran
tically
had
such
an
effect
that
they
managed
to
squeeze
through
to
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
and
stopped
the
infantry
.
beside
the
bridge
nesvftski
found
the
colonel
to
whom
he
had
to
deliver
the
order
and
having
done
this
he
rode

the

to

he
watched

draw
nearer
.
then
the
clang
of
hoofs
as
of
several
horses
galloping
resounded
on
the
planks
of
the

and
the
squadron
officers
in

and
men
four
abreast
spread
across
the
bridge
and
began
to

on

chapter

the
last
of
the
infantry
hurriedly
crossed
the
bridge
squeezing
together
as
they
approached
it
as
if
passing
through
a
funnel
.
at
last
the
baggage
wagons
had
all
crossed
the
crush
was
less
and
the
last
battalion
came
on
to
the
bridge
.
only
denisovs
squadron
of
hussars
remained
on
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
facing
the
en
emy
who
could
be
seen
from
the
hill
on
the
opposite
bank
but
was
not
yet
visible
from
the
bridge
for
the
horizon
as
seen
from
the
valley
through
which
the
river
flowed
was
formed
by
the
rising
ground
only
half
a
mile
away
.
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
lay
wasteland
over
which
a
few
groups
of
our
cossack
scouts
were
moving
.
sud
denly
on
the
road
at
the
top
of
the
high
ground
artillery
and
troops
in
blue
uniform
were
seen
.
these
were
the
french
.
a
group
of
cossack
scouts
retired
down
the
hill
at
a
trot
.
all
the
officers
and
men
of
denisovs
squadron
though
they
tried
to
talk
of
other
things
and
to
look
in
other
directions
thought
only
of
what
was
there
on
the
hilltop
and
kept
constantly
look
ing
at
the
patches
appearing
on
the
skyline
which
they
knew
to
be
the
enemys
troops
.
the
weather
had
cleared
again
since
noon
and
the
sun
was
descending
brightly
upon
the
danube
and
the
dark
hills
around
it
.
it
was
calm
and
at
intervals
the
bugle
calls
and
the
shouts
of
the
enemy
could
be
heard
from
the
hill
.
there
was
no
one
now
between
the
squadron
and
the
enemy
except
a
few
scattered
skirmishers
.
an
empty
space
of
some
seven
hundred
yards
was
all
that
separated
them
.
the
enemy
ceased
fir
ing
and
that
stern
threatening
inaccessible
and
intangible
line
which
separates
two
hostile
armies
was
all
the
more
clearly
felt
.
one
step
beyond
that
boundary
line
which
resembles
the
line
dividing
the
living
from
the
dead
lies
uncertainty
suffering
and
death
.
and
what
is
there
who
is
there
there
beyond
that
field
that
tree
that
roof
lit
up
by
the
sun
no
one
knows
but
one
wants
to
know
.
you
fear
and
yet
long
to
cross
that
line
and
know
that
sooner
or
later
it
must
be
crossed
and
you
will
have
to
find
out
what
is
there
just
as
you
will
inevitably
have
to
learn
what
lies
the
other
side
of
death
.
but
you
are
strong
healthy
cheerful
and
excited
and
are
surrounded
by

so
thinks
or
at
any
rate
feels
anyone
who
comes
in
sight
of
the
enemy
and
that
feeling
gives
a
particular
glamour
and
glad
keenness
of
im
pression
to
everything
that
takes
place
at
such
moments
.
on
the
high
ground
where
the
enemy
was
the
smoke
of
a
cannon

and
a
ball
flew
whistling
over
the
heads

on

were

a

and
a
third
cannon
ball
flew
past
.
evidently
they
were
firing
at
the
hussars
but
the
balls
with
rapid
rhythmic
whistle
flew
over
the
heads
of
the
horsemen
and
fell
somewhere
beyond
them
.
the
hussars
did
not
look
round
but
at
the
sound
of
each
shot
as
at
the
word
of
com
mand
the
whole
squadron
with
its
rows
of
faces
so
alike
yet
so
different
holding
its
breath
while
the
ball
flew
past
rose
in
the
stirrups
and
sank
back
again
.
the
soldiers
without
turning
their
heads
glanced
at
one
another
curious
to
see
their
comrades
impression
.
every
face
from
denisovs
to
that
of
the
bugler
showed
one
common
expression
of
conflict
irritation
and
excitement
around
chin
and
mouth

some

the

a
schoolboy
called
up
before
a
large
audi
ence
for
an
examination
in
which
he
feels
sure
he
will
distinguish
himself
.
he
was
glancing
at
everyone
with
a
clear
bright
expression
as
if
asking
them
to
notice
how
calmly
he
sat
under
fire

but
despite
himself
on
his

too
that

indication

showed
round

cried

who
unable
to

on

kept
turning
his

in

of
the

sturdy
figure
with
the
sinewy
hairy
hand
and
stumpy
fingers
in
which
he
held
the
hilt
of
his
naked
saber
looked
just
as
it
usually
did
especially
toward
evening
when
he
had
emptied
his
second
bot
tle
he
was
only
redder
than
usual
.
with
his
shaggy
head
thrown
back
like

when
they
drink
pressing
his
spurs
mercilessly
into

of

and
sitting
as
though
falling
backwards
in

he
gal
loped
to
the
other
flank
of
the

and
shouted
in
a
hoarse
voice
to
the
men
to
look
to
their
pistols
.
he
rode
up
to

.
the
staff
captain
on
his
broadbacked
steady
mare
came
at
a
walk
to
meet
him
.
his
face
with
its
long
mustache
was
serious
as
always
only
his
eyes
were
brighter
than
usual
.
well
what
about
it
said
he
to
denfsov
.
it
wont
come

.
ah

he
cried
no
ticing
the

bright

it
at

and
he
smiled
approvingly
evidently
pleased
with
the
cadet
.
rost6v
felt
perfectly
happy
.
just
then
the
commander
appeared
on
the
bridge
.
denisov
galloped
up
to
him
.
your
excellency
let
us
attack

ill
dwive
them

attack
indeed
said
the
colonel
in
a
bored
voice
puckering
up
his
face
as
if
driving
off
a
troublesome
fly
.
and
why
are
you
stopping
here
dont
you
see
the
skirmishers
are

ing
lead
the
squadron
back
.
the
squadron
crossed
the
bridge
and
drew
out
of
range
of
fire
without
having
lost
a
single
man
.
the
second
squadron
that
had
been
in
the
front
line
followed
them
across
and
the
last
cossacks
quitted
the
farther
side
of
the
river
.
the
two
pavlograd
squadrons
having
crossed
the
bridge
retired
up
the
hill
one
after
the
oth
er
.
their
colonel
karl
bogddnich
schubert
came
up
to
denisovs
squadron
and
rode
at
a
footpace
not
far
from
rost6v
without
taking
any
notice
of
him
although
they
were
now
meeting
for
the
first
time
since
their
encounter
concerning
telydnin
.
rost6v
feeling
that
he
was
at
the
front
and
in
the
power
of
a
man
to
ward
whom
he
now
admitted
that
he
had
been
to
blame
did
not
lift
his
eyes
from
the
colonels
athletic
back
his
nape
covered
with
light
hair
and
his
red
neck
.
it
seemed
to
rost6v
that
bog
ddnich
was
only
pretending
not
to
notice
him
and
that
his
whole
aim
now
was
to
test
the
cadets
courage
so
he
drew
himself
up
and
looked
around
him
merrily
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
bogddnich
rode
so
near
in
order
to
show
him
his
courage
.
next
he
thought
that
his
enemy
would
send
the
squadron
on
a
des
perate
attack
just
to
punish
him
rost6v
.
then
he
imagined
how
after
the
attack
bogdanich
would
come
up
to
him
as
he
lay
wounded
and
book
two

would
magnanimously
extend
the
hand
of
reconciliation
.
the

the
pavlograds
as
he
had
but
recently
left
their

rode
up
to
the
colonel
.
aft
er
his
dismissal
from

not
remained
in
the
regiment
saying
he
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
slave
at
the
front
when
he
could
get
more
rewards
by
doing
nothing
on
the
staff
and
had
succeeded
in
attaching
him
self
as
an
orderly
officer
to
prince
bagrati6n
.
he
now
came
to
his
former
chief
with
an
order
from
the
commander
of
the
rearguard
.
colonel
he
said
addressing
rost6vs
en
emy
with
an
air
of
gloomy
gravity
and
glanc
ing
round
at
his
comrades
there
is
an
order
to
stop
and
fire
the
bridge
.
an
order
to
who
asked
the
colonel
mo
rosely
.
i
dont
myself
know
to
who

replied
the
cornet
in
a
serious
tone
but
the
prince
told
me
to
go
and
tell
the
colonel
that
the
hussars
must
return
quickly
and
fire
the
bridge
.

zherkov
was
followed
by
an
officer
of
the
suite
who
rode
up
to
the
colonel
of
hussars
with
the
same
order
.
after
him
the
stout
nesvft
ski
came
galloping
up
on
a
cossack
horse
that
could
scarcely
carry
his
weight
.
hows
this
colonel
he
shouted
as
he
ap
proached
.
i
told
you
to
fire
the
bridge
and
now
someone
has
gone
and
blundered
they
are
all
beside
themselves
over
there
and
one
cant
make
anything
out
.
the
colonel
deliberately
stopped
the
regi
ment
and
turned
to
nesvftski
.
you
spoke
to
me
of
inflammable
material
said
he
but
you
said
nothing
about
firing
it
.
but
my
dear
sir
said
nesvftski
as
he
drew
up
taking
off
his
cap
and
smoothing
his
hair
wet
with

with
his
plump
hand

strictly
to

you
said
the

would
be
burned
but
who
would
it
burn
i
could
not
know
by
the
holy
spirit
ah
thats

said
nesvitski
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
.
how
did
you
get
here
said
he
turning
to
zherk6v
.
on
the
same
business
.
but
you

the

tone

colonel
interrupted
the
officer
of
the
suite
you
must
be
quick
or
the
enemy
will
bring
up
his
guns
to
use
grapeshot
.
the
colonel
looked
silently
at
the
officer
of
the
suite
at
the
stout
staff
officer
and
at
zher
k6v
and
he
frowned
.
i
will
the
bridge
fire
he
said
in
a
solemn
tone
as
if
to
announce
that
in
spite
of
all
the
unpleasantness
he
had
to
endure
he
would
still
do
the
right
thing
.
striking
his
horse
with
his
long
muscular
legs
as
if
it
were
to
blame
for
everything
the
colonel
moved
forward
and
ordered
the
second
squadron
that
in
which
rostov
was
serving
un
der
denfsov
to
return
to
the
bridge
.
there
its
just
as
i
thought
said
rost6v
to
himself
.
he
wishes
to
test
me
his
heart
contracted
and
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
.
let
him
see
whether
i
am
a
coward
he
thought
.
again
on
all
the
bright
faces
of
the
squadron
the
serious
expression
appeared
that
they
had
worn
when
under
fire
.
rost6v
watched
his
en
emy
the
colonel
closely
to
find
in
his
face
confirmation
of
his
own
conjecture
but
the
colonel
did
not
once
glance
at
rost6v
and
looked
as
he
always
did
when
at
the
front
sol
emn
and
stern
.
then
came
the
word
of
com
mand
.

several
voices
re
peated
around
him
.
their
sabers
catching
in
the
bridles
and
their
spurs
jingling
the
hussars
hastily
dismounted
not
knowing
what
they
were
to
do
.
the
men
were
crossing
themselves
.
rostov
no
longer
looked
at
the
colonel
he
had
no
time
.
he
was
afraid
of
falling
behind
the
hussars
so
much
afraid
that
his
heart
stood
still
.
his
hand
trem
bled
as
he
gave
his
horse
into
an
orderlys
charge
and
he
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
heart
with
a
thud
.
denfsov
rode
past
him
leaning
back
and
shouting
something
.
rostov
saw
noth
ing
but
the
hussars
running
all
around
him
their
spurs
catching
and
their
sabers
clattering
.
stretchers
shouted
someone
behind
him
.
rost6v
did
not
think
what
this
call
for
stretchers
meant
he
ran
on
trying
only
to
be
ahead
of
the
others
but
just
at
the
bridge
not
looking
at
the
ground
he
came
on
some
sticky
trodden
mud
stumbled
and
fell
on
his
hands
.
the
others
outstripped
him
.
at
boss
zides
captain
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
colonel
who
having
ridden
ahead
had
pulled
up
his
horse
near
the
bridge
with
a
tri
umphant
cheerful
face
.
rost6v
wiping
his
muddy
hands
on
his
breeches
looked
at
his
enemy
and
was
about
to
8o
war
and
peace
run
on
thinking
that
the
farther
he
went
to
the
front
the
better
.
but
bogdanich
without
look
ing
at
or
recognizing
rost6v
shouted
to
him
whos
that
running
on
the
middle
of
the
bridge
to
the
right
come
back
cadetl
he
cried
angrily
and
turning
to
denisov
who
showing
off
his
courage
had
ridden
on
to
the
planks
of
the
bridge
why
run
risks
captain
you
should
dis
mount
he
said
.
oh
every
bullet
has
its
billet
answered
vdska
denfsov
turning
in
his
saddle
.
meanwhile
nesvitski
zherk6v
and
the
of
ficer
of
the
suite
were
standing
together
out
of
range
of
the
shots
watching
now
the
small
group
of
men
with
yellow
shakos
darkgreen
jackets
braided
with
cord
and
blue
riding
breeches
who
were
swarming
near
the
bridge
and
then
at
what
was
approaching
in
the
dis
tance
from

first
will
they
get
there
and
fire
the

or
will
the
french
get
within
grapeshot
range
and
wipe
them
out
these
were
the
questions
each
man
of
the
troops
on
the
high
ground
above
the
bridge
involuntarily
asked
himself
with
a
sinking
heart
watching
the
bridge
and
the
hussars
in
the
bright
evening
light
and
the
blue
tunics
advancing
from
the
other
side
with
their
bayonets
and
guns
.
ugh
.
the
hussars
will
get
it
hotl
said
nes
vftski
they
are
within
grapeshot
range
now
.
he
shouldnt
have
taken
so
many
men
said
the
officer
of
the
suite
.
true
enough
answered
nesvitski
two
smart
fellows
could
have
done
the
job
just
as
well
.
ah
your
excellency
put
in
zherk6v
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
hussars
but
still
with
that
naive
air
that
made
i
t
impossible
to
know
wheth
er
he
was
speaking
in
jest
or
in
earnest
.
ah
your
excellency
1
how
you
look
at
things
send
two
men
and
who
then
would
give
us
the
vladimir
medal
and
ribbon
but
now
even
if
they
do
get
peppered
the
squadron
may
be
recommended
for
honors
and
he
may
get
a
rib
bon
.
our
bogddnich
knows
how
things
are
done
.
there
now
said
the
officer
of
the
suite
thats
grapeshot
.
he
pointed
to
the
french
guns
the
limbers
of
which
were
being
detached
and
hurriedly
removed
.
on
the
french
side
amid
the
groups
with
cannon
a
cloud
of
smoke
appeared
then
a
sec
ond
and
a
third
almost
simultaneously
and
at
the
moment
when
the
first
report
was
heard
a
fourth
was
seen
.
then
two
reports
one
after
another
and
a
third
.
oh
ohl
groaned
nesvitski
as
if
in
fierce
pain
seizing
the
officer
of
the
suite
by
the
arm
.
look
a
man
has
fallen
fallen
fallen
two
i
think
.
if
i
were
tsar
i
would
never
go
to
war
said
nesvitski
turning
away
.
the
french
guns
were
hastily
reloaded
.
the
infantry
in
their
blue
uniforms
advanced
to
ward
the
bridge
at
a
run
.
smoke
appeared
again
but
at
irregular
intervals
and
grapeshot
cracked
and
rattled
onto
the
bridge
.
but
this
time
nesvitski
could
not
see
what
was
happen
ing
there
as
a
dense
cloud
of
smoke
arose
from
it
.
the
hussars
had
succeeded
in
setting
it
on
fire
and
the
french
batteries
were
now
firing
at
them
no
longer
to
hinder
them
but
because
the
guns
were
trained
and
there
was
someone
to
fire
at
.
the
french
had
time
to
fire
three
rounds
of
grapeshot
before
the
hussars
got
back
to
their
horses
.
two
were
misdirected
and
the
shot
went
too
high
but
the
last
round
fell
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
hussars
and
knocked
three
of
them
over
.
rost6v
absorbed
by
his
relations
with
bog
ddnich
had
paused
on
the
bridge
not
knowing
what
to
do
.
there
was
no
one
to
hew
down
as
he
had
always
imagined
battles
to
himself
nor
could
he
help
to
fire
the
bridge
because
he
had
not
brought
any
burning
straw
with
him
like
the
other
soldiers
.
he
stood
looking
about
him
when
suddenly
he
heard
a
rattle
on
the
bridge
as
if
nuts
were
being
spilt
and
the
hussar
near
est
to
him
fell
against
the
rails
with
a
groan
.
rost6v
ran
up
to
him
with
the
others
.
again
someone
shouted
stretchers
four
men
seized
the
hussar
and
began
lifting
him
.
oooh
for
christs
sake
let
me
alone
cried
the
wounded
man
but
still
he
was
lifted
and
laid
on
the
stretcher
.
nicholas
rost6v
turned
away
and
as
if
searching
for
something
gazed
into
the
dis
tance
at
the
waters
of
the
danube
at
the
sky
and
at
the
sun
.
how
beautiful
the
sky
looked
how
blue
how
call

and
how
deep
how
bright
and
glorious
was
the
setting
sun
with
what
soft

the

at
that
instant
the
sun
began
to
hide
behind
the
clouds
and
other
stretchers
came
into
view
before
rost6v
.
and
the
fear
of
death
and
of
the
stretchers
and
love
of
the
sun
and
of
life
all
merged
into
one
feeling
of
sickening
agita
tion
.
o
lord
god
thou
who

rost6v

the
hussars
ran
back
to
the
men
who
held
their
horses
their
voices
sounded
louder
and
calmer
the
stretchers
disappeared
from
sight
.

rost6v
and

he
took

stood

began
to

and
denfsov
rode
up
to
a
group
that
had
stopped
near
rost6v
composed
of
the
colonel
nesvftski
zherk6v
and
the
officer
from
the

.
well
it
seems
that
no

has
noticed

rost6v
.
and
this
was
true
.
no

had
taken
any
notice
for
everyone
knew
the
sensa

which
the
cadet
under

for
the
first

had
experienced

the

triumphantly
and
gaily
.

the
colonel
in
his
bass
voice
two

one

out
he
added
unable
to
restrain
a
happy
smile
and
pronouncing
the
phrase
knocked
out
with
ringing
distinctness

the

only
as

as

there

at

and
melk
but
despite
the
courage
and
endurance
acknowledged
even
by
the
enemy
with
which

of
these

was

had
escaped

and
had

at

now
separated
from
the
russian
army
and
kutuzov
was
left
with
only
his
own
weak
and
exhausted
forces
.
the
de
fense
of
vienna
was
no
longer
to
be
thought
of
.
instead
of
an
offensive
the
plan
of
which
carefully
prepared
in
accord
with
the
modern
science
of
strategics
had
been
handed
to
ku
tuzov
when
he
was
in
vienna
by
the
austrian
hofkriegsrath
the
sole
and
almost
unattain
able
aim
remaining
for
him
was
to
effect
a
junction
with
the
forces
that
were
advancing
from
russia
without
losing
his
army
as
mack
had
done
at
ulm
.
on
the
twentyeighth
of
october
kutuzov
with
his
army
crossed
to
the
left
bank
of
the
danube
and
took
up
a
position
for
the
first
time
with
the
river
between
himself
and
the
main
body
of
the
french
.
on
the
thirtieth
he
attacked
mortiers
division
which
was
on
the
left
bank
and
broke
it
up
.
in
this
action
for
the
first
time
trophies
were
taken
banners
cannon
and
two
enemy
generals
.
for
the
first
time
after
a
fortnights
retreat
the
russian
troops
had
halted
and
after
a
fight
had
not
on
ly
held
the
field
but
had
repulsed
the
french
.
though
the
troops
were
illclad
exhausted
and
had
lost
a
third
of
their
number
in
killed
wounded

and
stragglers
though
a

of

wounded
had
been
abandoned
on
the
other
side
of
the
danube
with
a
letter
in
which
kutuzov
entrusted
them
to
the
hu

and
though
the

and
the

into

raised
the
spirits
of

rumors
were
rife
of
the

of

prince
andrew
during
the
battle
had
been
in
attendance
on
the
austrian
general
schmidt
who
was
killed
in
the
action
.
his
horse
had
been
wounded
under
him
and
his
own
arm
slightly
grazed
by
a
bullet
.
as
a
mark
of
the
commander
in
chiefs
special
favor
he
was
sent
with
the
news
of
this
victory
to
the
austrian
court
now
no
longer
at
vienna
which
was
threatened
by
the
french
but
at
brunn
.
de
spite
his
apparently
delicate
build
prince
an
drew
could
endure
physical
fatigue
far
better
than
many
very
muscular
men
and
on
the
night
of
the
battle
having
arrived
at
krems
ex

but
not
weary
with
dispatches
from
dokh
turov
to
kutiizov
he
was
sent
immediately
with
a
special
dispatch
to
brunn
.
to
be
so
sent
meant
not
only
a
reward
but
an
important
step
toward
promotion

the
night
was
dark

andrew
was
gallop
ing
along
in

chaise
enjoying
the
feel

of
a
man
who
has
at
length
begun
to
at
tain
a
longdesired
happiness
.
as
soon
as
he
closed
his
eyes
his
ears
seemed
filled
with
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
and
the
sensation
of
vic
tory
.
then
he
began
to
imagine
that
the
rus
sians
were
running
away
and
that
he
himself
was
killed
but
he
quickly
roused
himself
with
a
feeling
of
joy
as
if
learning
afresh
that
this
was
not
so
but
that
on
the
contrary
the
french
had
run
away
.
he
again
recalled
all
the
details
of
the
victory
and
his
own
calm
courage
dur
ing
the
battle
and
feeling
reassured
he
dozed
off
.

.
the
dark
starry
night
was
followed
by
a
bright
cheerful
morning
.
the
snow
was
thaw
ing
in
the
sunshine
the
horses
galloped
quick
ly
and
on
bqth
sides
of
the
road
were
forests
of
different
kinds
fields
and
villages
.
at
one
of
the
post
stations
he
overtook
a
convoy
of
russian
wounded
.
the
russian
of
ficer
in
charge
of
the
transport
lolled
back
in
the
front
cart
shouting
and
scolding
a
soldier
with
coarse
abuse
.
in
each
of
the
long
german
carts
six
or
more
pale
dirty
bandaged
men
were
being
jolted
over
the
stony
road
.
some
of
them
were
talking
he
heard
russian
words
others
were
eating
bread
the
more
severely
wounded
looked
silently
with
the
languid
in
terest
of
sick
children
at
the
envoy
hurrying
past
them
.
prince
andrew
told
his

to

he
said
to

came

to

asked
the
officer
evidently
anxious
to
start
a
conversation
.

newsl

..
.
go
on
he
shouted
to
the
driver
and
they
galloped
on
.
it
was
already
quite
dark
when
prince
an
drew
rattled
over
the
paved
streets
of
briinn
and
found
himself
surrounded
by
high
build
ings
the
lights
of
shops
houses
and
street
lamps
fine
carriages
and
all
that
atmosphere
of
a
large
and
active
town
which
is
always
so
attractive
to
a
soldier
after
camp
life
.
despite
his
rapid
journey
and
sleepless
night
prince
andrew
when
he
drove
up
to
the
palace
felt
even
more
vigorous
and
alert
than
he
had
done
the
day
before
.
only
his
eyes
gleamed
feverish
ly
and
his
thoughts
followed
one
another
with
extraordinary
clearness
and
rapidity
.
he
again
vividly
recalled
the
details
of
the
battle
no
longer
dim
but
definite
and
in
the
concise
form
in
which
he
imagined
himself
stating
them
to
the
emperor
francis
.
he
vividly
imagined
the
casual
questions
that
might
be
put
to
him
and
the
answers
he
would
give
.
he
expected
to
be
at
once
presented
to
the
emperor
.
at
the
chief
entrance
to
the
palace
however
an
official
came
running
out
to
meet
him
and
learning
that
he
was
a
special
messenger
led
him
to
another
en
trance
.
to
the
right
from
the
corridor
euer
hoch
geboren
there
youwill
find
the
adjutant
on
duty
said
the
official
.
he
will
conduct
you
to
the
minister
of
war
.
the
adjutant
on
duty
meeting
prince
an
drew
asked
him
to
wait
and
went
in
to
the
minister
of
war
.
five
minutes
later
he
returned
and
bowing
with
particular
courtesy
ushered
prince
andrew
before
him
along
a
corridor
to
the
cabinet
where
the
minister
of
war
was
at
work
.
the
adjutant
by
his
elaborate
courtesy
book
appeared
to
wish
to
ward
off
any
attempt
at
familiarity
on
the
part
o
the
russian
messen
ger
.
prince
andrews
joyous
feeling
was
consid
erably
weakened
as
he
approached
the
door
of
the
ministers
room
.
he
felt
offended
and
with
out
his
noticing
it
the
feeling
of
offense
im
mediately
turned
into
one
of
disdain
which
was
quite
uncalled
for
.
his
fertile
mind
in
stantly
suggested
to
him
a
point
of
view
which
gave
him
a
right
to
despise
the
adjutant
and
the
minister
.
away
from
the
smell
of
powder
they
probably
think
it
easy
to
gain
victories
he
thought
.
his
eyes
narrowed
disdainfully
he
entered
the
room
of
the
minister
of
war
with
peculiarly
deliberate
steps
.
this
feeling
of
dis
dain
was
heightened
when
he
saw
the
minister
seated
at
a
large
table
reading
some
papers
and
making
pencil
notes
on
them
and
for
the
first
two
or
three
minutes
taking
no
notice
of
his
arrival
.
a
wax
candle
stood
at
each
side
of
the
ministers
bent
bald
head
with
its
gray
temples
.
he
went
on
reading
to
the
end
without
rais
ing
his
eyes
at
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
.
take
this
and
deliver
it
said
he
to
his
ad
jutant
handing
him
the
papers
and
still
tak
ing
no
notice
of
the
special
messenger
.
prince
andrew
felt
that
either
the
actions
of
kutuzovs
army
interested
the
minister
of
war
less
than
any
of
the
other
matters
he
was
con
cerned
with
or
he
wanted
to
give
the
russian
special
messenger
that
impression
.
but
that
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
he
thought
.
the
minister
drew
the
remaining
papers
together
arranged
them
evenly
and
then
raised
his
head
.
he
had
an
intellectual
and
distinctive
head
but
the
instant
he
turned
to
prince
andrew
the
firm
intelligent
expres
sion
on
his
face
changed
in
a
way
evidently
de
liberate
and
habitual
to
him
.
his
face
took
on
the
stupid
artificial
smile
which
does
not
even
attempt
to
hide
its
artificiality
of
a
man
who
is
continually
receiving
many
petitioners
one
aft
er
another
.
from
general
field
marshal
kutiizov
he
asked
.
i
hope
it
is
good
ftews
there
has
been
an
encounter
with
mortier
a
victory
it
was
high
timel
he
took
the
dispatch
which
was
addressed
to
him
and
began
to
read
it
with
a
mournful
ex
pression
.
oh
my
god
my
god
schmidt
he
ex
claimed
in
german
.
what
a
calamity
what
a
calamity
having
glanced
through
the
dispatch
he
laid
two
83
it
on
the
table
and
looked
at
prince
andrew
evidently
considering
something
.
ah
what
a
calamity
you
say
the
affair
was
decisive
but
mortier
is
not
captured
.
again
he
pondered
.
i
am
very
glad
you
have
brought
good
news
though
schmidts
death
is
a
heavy
price
to
pay
for
the
victory
.
his
majesty
will
no
doubt
wish
to
see
you
but
not
today
.
i
thank
you
you
must
have
a
rest
.
be
at
the
levee
to
morrow
after
the
parade
.
however
i
will
let
you
know
.
the
stupid
smile
which
had
left
his
face
while
he
was
speaking
reappeared
.
au
revoir
thank
you
very
much
.
his
maj
esty
will
probably
desire
to
see
you
he
added
bowing
his
head
.
when
prince
andrew
left
the
palacehe
felt
that
all
the
interest
and
happiness
the
victory
had
afforded
him
had
been
now
left
in
the
in
different
hands
of
the
minister
of
war
and
the
polite
adjutant
.
the
whole
tenor
of
his
thoughts
instantaneously
changed
the
battle
seemed
the
memory
of
a
remote
event
long
past
.
chapter
x
prince
andrew
stayed
at
briinn
with
bilibin
a
russian
acquaintance
of
his
in
the
diplomat
ic
service
.
ah
my
dear
prince
i
could
not
haveamore
welcome
visitor
said
bilibin
as
he
came
out
to
meet
prince
andrew
.
franz
put
the
princes
things
in
my
bedroom
said
he
to
the
servant
who
was
ushering
bolk6nski
in
.
so
youre
a
messenger
of
victory
eh
splendid
and
i
am
sitting
here
ill
as
you
see
.
after
washing
and
dressing
prince
andrew
came
into
the
diplomats
luxurious
study
and
sat
down
to
the
dinner
prepared
for
him
.
bili
bin
settled
down
comfortably
beside
the
fire
.
after
his
journey
and
the
campaign
during
which
he
had
been
deprived
of
all
the
comforts
of
cleanliness
and
all
the
refinements
of
life
prince
andrew
felt
a
pleasant
sense
of
repose
among
luxurious
surroundings
such
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
from
childhood
.
besides
it
was
pleasant
after
his
reception
by
the
aus
trians
to
speak
if
not
in
russian
for
they
were
speaking
french
at
least
with
a
russian
who
would
he
supposed
share
the
general
rus
sian
antipathy
to
the
austrians
which
was
then
particularly
strong
.
bilibin
was
a
man
of
thirtyfive
a
bachelor
and
of
the
same
circle
as
prince
andrew
.
they
had
known
each
other
previously
in
peters
burg
but
had
become
more
intimate
when
prince
andrew
was
in
vienna
with
kutuzov
.
84
just
as
prince
andrew
was
a
young
man
who
gave
promise
of
rising
high
in
the
military
pro
fession
so
to
an
even
greater
extent
bilibin
gave
promise
of
rising
in
his
diplomatic
career
.
he
was
still
a
young
man
but
no
longer
a
young
diplomat
as
he
had
entered
the
service
at
the
age
of
sixteen
had
been
in
paris
and
copen
hagen
and
now
held
a
rather
important
post
in
vienna
.
both
the
foreign
minister
and
our
ambassador
in
vienna
knew
him
and
valued
him
.
he
was
not
one
of
those
many
diplomats
who
are
esteemed
because
they
have
certain
negative
qualities
avoid
doing
certain
things
and
speafcfrench
.
he
was
one
of
those
who
liking
work
knew
how
to
do
it
and
despite
his
indolence
would
sometimes
spend
a
whole
qight
at
his
writing
table
.
he
worked
equally
well
whatever
the
import
of
his
work
.
it
was
not
the
question
what
for
but
the
question
how
that
interested
him
.
what
the
diplo
matic
matter
might
be
he
did
not
care
but
it
gave
him
great
pleasure
to
prepare
a
circular
memorandum
or
report
skillfully
pointedly
and
elegantly
.
bilfbins
services
were
valued
not
only
for
what
he
wrote
but
also
for
his
skill
in
dealing
and
conversing
with
those
in
the
highest
spheres
.
bilfbin
liked
conversation
as
he
liked
work
only
when
it
could
be
made
elegantly
witty
.
in
society
he
always
awaited
an
opportunity
to
say
something
striking
and
took
part
in
a
con
versation
only
when
that
was
possible
.
his
con
versation
was
always
sprinkled
with
wittily
orig
inal
finished
phrases
of
general
interest
.
these
sayings
were
prepared
in
the
inner
laboratory
of
his
mind
in
a
portable
form
as
if
intention
ally
so
that
insignificant
society
people
might
carry
them
from
drawing
room
to
drawing
room
.
and
in
fact
bilfbins
witticisms
were
hawked
about
in
the
viennese
drawing
rooms
and
often
had
an
influence
on
matters
consid
ered
important
.
his
thin
worn
sallow
face
was
covered
with
deep
wrinkles
which
always
looked
as
clean
and
well
washed
as
the
tips
of
ones
fingers
after
a
russian
bath
.
the
movement
of
these
wrinkles
formed
the
principal
play
of
expression
on
his
face
.
now
his
forehead
would
pucker
into
deep
folds
and
his
eyebrows
were
lifted
then
his
eye
brows
would
descend
and
deep
wrinkles
would
crease
his
cheeks
.
his
small
deepset
eyes
al
ways
twinkled
and
looked
out
straight
.
well
now
tell
me
about
your
exploits
said
he
.
bolk6nski
very
modestly
without
once
men
tioning
himself
described
the
engagement
and
war
and
peace
his
reception
by
the
minister
of
war
.
they
received
me
and
my
news
as
one
re
ceives
a
dog
in
a
game
of
skittles
said
he
in
conclusion
.
bilibin
smiled
and
the
wrinkles
on
his
face
disappeared
.

remarked

his

from

a
he
went
on
talking
in
this
way
in
french
uttering
only
those
words
in
russian
on
which
he
wished
to
put
a
contemptuous
emphasis
.

you
with

seriously
said
prince
andrew
we
can
at
any
rate
say
without
boasting
that
it
was
a
little
better
than
at

.

.

.
why
didnt
you
capture
one
just
one
mar
shal
for
us
because
not
everything
happens
as
one
ex
pects
or
with
the
smoothness
of
a

.
we
had
expected
as
i
told
you
to
get
at
their
rear
by
seven
in
the
morning
but
had
not
reached
it
by
five
in
the
afternoon
.

why
didnt
you
do
it
at

in
the
morning
you
ought
to
have
been
there
at

returned
bilfbin
with
a
smile
.
you
ought
to
have
been
there
at
seven
in
the
morning
.
why
did
you
not
succeed
in
impressing
on
bonaparte
by
diplomatic
methods
that
he
had
better
leave
genoa
alone
retorted
prince
andrew
in
the
same
tone
.
i
know
interrupted
bilfbin
youre
think
ing
its
very
easy
to
take
marshals
sitting
on
a
sofa
by
the
fire
that
is
true
but
still
why
didnt
you
capture
him
so
dont
be
surprised
if
not
only
the
minister
of
war
but
also
his
most
august
majesty
the
emperor
and
king
francis
is
not
much
delighted
by
your
victory
.
even
i
a

do
not

at

suddenly
unwrinkled
his
forehead
.

its

besides
suppose

if
even
the

gained
a

what
effect
would
that
have
on

its

is
at

after

fatigues
and
impressions
of
the
journey
his
reception
and
especially
after

felt
that

in
the
full
significance
of
the
words

heard

.
you
see
that
your
victory
is
not
a
matter
for
great
rejoicing
and
that
you
cant
be
received
as
a
savior
.
really
i
dont
care
about
that
i
dont
care
at
all
said
prince
andrew
beginning
to
un
derstand
that
his
news
of
the
battle
before
krems
was
really
of
small
importance
in
view
of
such
events
as
the
fall
of
austrias
capital
.
how
is
it
vienna
was
taken
what
of
the
two
85
bridge
and
its
celebrated
bridgehead
and
prince
auersperg
we
heard
reports
that
prince
au
ersperg
was
defending
vienna
he
said
.
prince
auersperg
is
on
this
on
our
side
of
the
river
and
is
defending
us
doing
it
very
badly
i
think
but
still
he
is
defending
us
.
but
vienna
is
on
the
other
side
.
no
the
bridge
has
not
yet
been
taken
and
i
hope
it
will
not
be
for
it
is
mined
and
orders
have
been
given
to
blow
it
up
.
otherwise
we
should
long
ago
have
been
in
the
mountains
of
bohemia
and
you
and
your
army
would
have
spent
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
between
two
fires
.
but
still
this
does
not
mean
that
the
cam
paign
is
over
said
prince
andrew
.
well
i
think
it
is
.
the
bigwigs
here
think
so
too
but
they
darent
say
so
.
it
will
be
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
it
wont
be
your
skirmishing
at
durrenstein
or
gun
powder
at
all
that
will
decide
the
matter
but
those
who
devised
it
said
bilfbin
quoting
one
of
his
own
mots
releasing
the
wrinkles
on
his
forehead
and
pausing
.
the
only
question
is
what
will
come
of
the
meeting
between
the
em
peror
alexander
and
the
king
of
prussia
in
berlin
if
prussia
joins
the
allies
austrias
hand
will
be
forced
and
there
will
be
war
.
if
not
it
is
merely
a
question
of
settling
where
the
preliminaries
of
the
new
campo
formio
are
to
be
drawn
up
.
what
an
extraordinary
genius
prince
an
drew
suddenly
exclaimed
clenching
his
small
hand
and
striking
the
table
with
it
and
what
luck
the
man
has
buonaparte
said
bilfbin
inquiringly
puckering
up
his
forehead
to
indicate
that
he
was
about
to
say
something
witty
.
buona
parte
he
repeated
accentuating
the
u
i
think
however
now
that
he
lays
down
laws
for
austria
at
schonbrunn
il
faut
lui
faire
grace
de
iu

i
shall
certainly
adopt
an
innovation
and
call
him
simply
bonapartel
but
joking
apart
said
prince
andrew
do
you
really
think
the
campaign
is
over
this
is
what
i
think
.
austria
has
been
made
a
fool
of
and
she
is
not
used
to
it
.
she
will
retal
iate
.
and
she
has
been
fooled
in
the
first
place
because
her
provinces
have
been
pillaged
they
say
the
holy
russian
army
loots
terribly
her
army
is
destroyed
her
capital
taken
and
all
this
for
the
beaux
yeux

of
his
sardinian
majesty
.
and
therefore
this
is
between
our
selves
i
instinctively
feel
that
we
are
being
de
ceived

me

that

if

shall

replied
bilibin
his
face
again
becoming
smooth
as
a
sign
that
the
conversation
was
at
an
end
.
when
prince
andrew
reached
the
room
pre
pared
for
him
and
lay
down
in
a
clean
shirt
on
the
feather
bed
with
its
warmed
and
fragrant
pillows
he
felt
that

he
had

far
far
away
from
him

occupied
his
thoughts
.
he
closed
his
eyes
and
immediately
a
sound
of
cannonading
of
musketry
and
the
rattling
of
carriage
wheels
seemed
to
fill
his
ears
and
now
again
drawn
out
in
a
thin
line
the
mus
keteers
were
descending
the
hill
the
french
were
firing
and
he
felt
his
heart
palpitating
as
he
rode
forward
beside
schmidt
with
the
bul
lets
merrily
whistling
all
around
and
he
ex
perienced
tenfold
the
joy
of
living
as
he
had
not
done
since
childhood
.
he
woke
up

..
.
yes
that
all
happened
he
said
and
smil
ing
happily
to
himself
like
a
child
he
fell
into
a
deep
youthful
slumber
.
chapter
xi
next
day
he
woke
late
.
recalling
his
recent
impressions
the
first
thought
that
came
into
his
mind
was
that
today
he
had
to
be
presented
to
the
emperor
francis
he
remembered
the
minister
of
war
the
polite
austrian
adjutant
bilibin
and
last
nights
conversation
.
having
dressed
for
his
attendance
at
court
in
full
pa
rade
uniform
which
he
had
not
worn
for
a
long
time
he
went
into
bilibins
study
fresh
animated
and
handsome
with
his
hand
band
aged
.
in
the
study
were
four
gentlemen
of
the
diplomatic
corps
.
with
prince
hippolyte
ku
ragin
who
was
a
secretary
to
the
embassy
bol
k6nski
was
already
acquainted
.
bilibin
intro
duced
him
to
the
others
.
the
gentlemen
assembled
at
bilfbins
were
young
wealthy
gay
society
men
who
here
as
in
vienna
formed
a
special
set
which
bilibin
their
leader
called
les
ndtres
this
set
consist
ing
almost
exclusively
of
diplomats
evidently
had
its
own
interests
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
war
or
politics
but
related
to
high
society
to
certain
women
and
to
the

service
.
these
gentlemen
received
prince
an
drew
as
one
of
themselves
an
honor
they
did
not
extend
to
many
.
from
politeness
and
to
start
conversation
they
asked
him
a
few
ques
tions
about
the
army
and
the
battle
and
then
the
talk
went
off
into
merry
jests
and
gossip
.
but
the
best
of
it
was
said
one
telling
of
the
misfortune
of
a
fellow
diplomat
that
the
chancellor
told
him
flatly
that
his
appoint
ment
to
london
was
a
promotion
and
that
he
was
so
to
regard
it
.
can
you
fancy
the
figure
he
cut

.

.

.
but
the
worst
of
it
gentlemen

is
that
that

the

of

burst
out

prince

moved
with

everybody
laughed

hippolyte
louder
than

he
was

breathed
painfully

could
not

it
is

chapter

at
the
levee
prince
andrew
stood
among
the
austrian
officers
as
he
had
been
told
to
and
the
emperor
francis
merely
looked
fixedly
into
his
face
and
just
nodded
to
him
with
his
long
head
.
but
after
it
was
over
the
adjutant
he
had
seen
the
previous
day
ceremoniously
informed
bol
k6nski
that
the
emperor
desired
to
give
him
an
audience
.
the
emperor
francis
received
him
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
be
fore
the
conversation
began
prince
andrew
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
the
emperor
seemed
confused
and
blushed
as
if
not
knowing
what
to
say
.
tell
me
when
did
the
battle
begin
he
asked
hurriedly
.
prince
andrew
replied
.
then
followed
oth
er
questions
just
as
simple
was
kutuzov
well
when
had
he
left
krems
and
so
on
.
the
em
peror
spoke
as
if
his
sole
aim
were
to
put
a
giv
en
number
of
questions
the
answers
to
these
questions
as
was
only
too
evident
did
not
in
terest
him
.
at
what
oclock
did
the
battle
begin
asked
the
emperor
.
i
cannot
inform
your
majesty
at
what
oclock
the
battle
began
at
the
front
but
at
durrenstein
where
i
was
our
attack
began
aft
er
five
in
the
afternoon
replied
bolk6nski
growing
more
animated
and
expecting
that
he
would
have
a
chance
to
give
a
reliable
account
which
he
had
ready
in
his
mind
of
all
he
knew
and
had
seen
.
but
the
emperor
smiled
and
in
terrupted
him
.

the

him
.
at
what
oclock
was

at

oclock
i
believe
.
at
seven
oclock
its
very

the
emperor
thanked
prince
andrew
and
bowed
.
prince
andrew
withdrew
and
was
im
mediately
surrounded
by
courtiers
on
all
sides
.
everywhere
he
saw
friendly
looks
and
heard
friendly
words
.
yesterdays
adjutant
re
proached
him
for
not
having
stayed
at
the

and
offered
him

up

the

the

also
wished
to
see
him
.
he
did
not
know
whom
to
answer
and
for
a
few
seconds
collected
his
thoughts
.
then
the
russian
ambassador
took
him
by
the
shoulder

led
him
to
the
window
and
began
to
talk
to

contrary
to

was
joyfully

bolk6nski
was
invited
everywhere
and
had
to
spend
the
whole
morning
calling
on
the
principal
austri
an
dignitaries
.
between
four
and
five
in
the
aft
ernoon
having
made
all
his
calls
he
was
re
turning
to
bilibins
house
thinking
out
a
let
ter
to
his
father
about
the
battle
and
his
visit
to
brunn
.
at
the
door
he
found
a
vehicle
half
full
of
luggage
.
franz
bilibins
man
was
drag
ging
a
portmanteau
with
some
difficulty
out
of
the
front
door
.
before
returning
to
bilibins
prince
andrew
had
gone
to
a
bookshop
to
provide
himself
with
some
books
for
the
campaign
and
had
spent
some
time
in
the
shop
.
what
is
it
he
asked
.
oh
your
excellency
1
said
franz
with
diffi
culty
rolling
the
portmanteau
into
the
vehicle
we
are
to
move
on
still
farther
.
the
scoundrel
is
again
at
our
heels
eh
what
asked
prince
andrew
.
bilibin
came
out
to
meet
him
.
his
usually
calm
face
showed
excitement
.
there
now
confess
that
this
is
delightful
said
he
.
this
affair
of
the
thabor
bridge
at
vienna
.

.

.

.
they
have
crossed
without
striking
a
blow
prince
andrew
could
not
understand
.
but
where
do
you
come
from
not
to
know
what
every
coachman
in
the
town
knows
i
come
from
the
archduchess
.
i
heard
noth
ing
there
.
and
you
didnt
see
that
everybody
is
pack
ing
up
i
did
not

.

.

.
what
is
it
all
about
inquired
prince
andrew
impatiently
.
whats
it
all
about
why
the
french
have
crossed
the
bridge
that
auersperg
was
defend
ing
and
the
bridge
was
not
blown
up
so
murat
is
now
rushing
along
the
road
to
brunn
and
will
be
here
in
a
day
or
two
.
what
here
but
why
did
they
not
blow
up
the
bridge
if
it
was
mined
that
is
what
i
ask
you
.
no
one
not
even
bonaparte
knows
why
.
bolk6nski
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
but
if
the
bridge
is
crossed
it
means
that
the
army
too
is
lost
it
will
be
cut
off
said
he
.
thats
just
it
answered
bilibin
.
listen
the
french
entered
vienna
as
i
told
you
.
very
well
.

was

observe
that

are

.
gentle
men
says
one
of
them
you
know
the
thabor
bridge
is
mined
and
doubly
mined
and
that
there
are
menacing
fortifications
at
its
head
and
an
army
of
fifteen
thousand
men
has
been
or
dered
to
blow
up
the
bridge
and
not
let
us
cross
but
it
will
please
our
sovereign
the
em
peror
napoleon
if
we
take
this
bridge
so
let
us
three
go
and
take
it
yes
lets
say
the
oth
ers
.
and
off
they
go
and
take
the
bridge
cross
it
and
now
with
their
whole
army
are
on
this
side
of
the
danube
marching
on

you
and
your
lines
of
communication
.
stop
jesting
said
prince
andrew
sadly
and
seriously
.
this
news
grieved
him
and
yet
he
was
pleased
.
as
soon
as
he
learned
that
the
russian
army
was
in
such
a
hopeless
situation
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
he
who
was
destined
to
lead
it
out
of
this
position
that
here
was
the
toulon
that
would
lift
him
from
the
ranks
of
obscure
officers
and
offer
him
the
first
step
to
fame
lis
tening
to
bilfbin
he
was
already
imagining
how
on
reaching
the
army
he
would
give
an
opin
ion
at
the
war
council
which
would
be
the
only
one
that
could
save
the
army
and
how
he
alone
would
be
entrusted
with
the
executing
of
the
plan
.
stop
this
jesting
he
said
.
i
am
not
jesting
bilibin
went
on
.
noth
ing
is

in
spite
of
the

of
his

bilibin
did
not
forget
to
pause
after
this
mot
to
give
time
for
its

.
the

rushes
to

but
what
is
best
of
all
he
went
on
his
excitement
subsiding
under
the
delightful
in
terest
of
his
own
story
is
that
the
sergeant
in

of
the

which
was
to
give
the

nal
to
fire
the

and
blow
up

this
sergeant
seeing
that
the
french

were
running
onto
the
bridge
was
about
to
fire
but
lannes
stayed
his

.
the
sergeant
who
was
evidently
wiser
than
his

up

he
concluded
feeling
that
he
had
produced
a
good
epigram
a
fresh
one
that
would
be
repeated
.
his
hitherto
puckered
brow
became
smooth
as
a
sign
of
pleasure
and
with
a
slight
smile
he
began
to
examine
his
nails
.

said
suddenly
to

prince

looked
inquiringly
at

and
gave
no

that
the

was

chapter
xiii
that
same
night
having
taken
leave
of
the
minister
of
war
bolkonski
set
off
to
rejoin
the
army
not
knowing
where
he
would
find
it
and
fearing
to
becaptured
by
the
french
on
the
way
to
krems
.
in
briinn
everybody
attached
to
the
court
was
packing
up
and
the
heavy
baggage
was
al
ready
being
dispatched
to
olmutz
.
near
het
zelsdorf
prince
andrew
struck
the
highroad
along
which
the
russian
army
was
moving
war
and
peace
with
great
haste
and
in
the
greatest
disorder
.
the
road
was
so
obstructed
with
carts
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
by
in
a
carriage
.
prince
andrew
took
a
horse
and
a
cossack
from
a
cos
sack
commander
and
hungry
and
weary
mak
ing
his
way
past
the
baggage
wagons
rode
in
search
of
the
commander
in
chief
and
of
hisown
luggage
.
very
sinister
reports
of
the
position
of
the
army
reached
him
as
he
went
along
and
the
appearance
of
the
troops
in
their
disorder
ly
flight
confirmed
these
rumors
.

he
remembered
these
words
in
bonapartes
address
to
his
army
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
and
they
awoke
in
him
astonishment
at
the
genius
of
his
hero
a
feeling
of
wounded
pride
and
a
hope
of
glory
.
and
should
there
be
nothing
left
but
to
die
he
thought
.
well
if
need
be
i
shall
do
it
no
worse
than
others
.
he
looked
with
disdain
at
the
endless
con
fused
mass
of
detachments
carts
guns
artillery
and
again
baggage
wagons
and
vehicles
of
all
kinds
overtaking
one
another
and
blocking
the
muddy
road
three
and
sometimes
four
abreast
.
from
all
sides
behind
and
before
as
far
as
ear
could
reach
there
were
the
rattle
of
wheels
the
creaking
of
carts
and
gun
carriages
the
tramp
of
horses
the
crack
of
whips
shouts
the
urging
of
horses
and
the
swearing
of
sol
diers
orderlies
and
officers
.
all
along
the
sides
of
the
road
fallen
horses
were
to
be
seen
some
flayed
some
not
and
brokendown
carts
be
sidewhich
solitary
soldiers
sat
waiting
forsome
thing
and
again
soldiers
straggling
from
their
companies
crowds
of
whom
set
off
to
the
neigh
boring
villages
or
returned
from
them
drag
ging
sheep
fowls
hay
and
bulging
sacks
.
at
each
ascent
or
descent
of
the
road
the
crowds
were
yet
denser
and
the
din
of
shouting
more
incessant
.
soldiers
floundering
kneedeep
in
mud
pushed
the
guns
and
wagons
themselves
.
whips
cracked
hoofs
slipped
traces
broke
and
lungs
were
strained
with
shouting
.
the
offi
cers
directing
the
march
rode
backward
and
forward
between
the
carts
.
their
voices
were
but
feebly
heard
amid
the
uproar
and
one
saw
by
their
faces
that
they
despaired
of
the
possi
bility
of
checking
this
disorder
.
here
is
our
dear
orthodox
russian
army
14i
that
russian
army
which
has
been
brought
from
the
ends
of

earth
by

gold

shall
cause
to

the
same
fate
the
fate
of

thought
bolk6nski
recalling
bilibins
words
.
wishing
to
find
outwhere
the
commanderin
chief
was
he
rode
up
to
a
convoy
.
directly
op
posite
to
him
came
a
strange
onehorse
vehicle
evidently
rigged
up
by
soldiers
out
of
any
available
materials
and
looking
like
some
thing
between
a
cart
a
cabriolet
and
a
cateche
.
a
soldier
was
driving
and
a
woman
enveloped
in
shawls
sat
behind
the
apron
under
the
leath
er
hood
of
the
vehicle
.
prince
andrew
rode
up
and
was
just
putting
his
question
to
a
soldier
when
his
attention
was
diverted
by
the
desper
ate
shrieks
of
the
woman
in
the
vehicle
.
an
of
ficer
in
charge
of
transport
was
beating
the
soldier
who
was
driving
the
womans
vehicle
for
trying
to
get
ahead
of
others
and
the
strokes
of
his
whip
fell
on
the
apron
of
the
equipage
.
the
woman
screamed
piercingly
.
seeing
prince
andrew
she
leaned
out
from
behind
the
apron
and
waving
her
thin
arms
from
under
the
wool
en
shawl
cried
mr

aidedecamp
mr

.

.

.
for

we
are
left
behind
and
have
lost
our
people

.

.

.
ill

into
a

shouted
the
angry
officer
to
the
soldier
.

with
your

mr

.

.

what
does
it
all

screamed
the
doctors
wife
.
kindly
let
this
cart
pass
.
dont
you
see
its
a
woman
said
prince
andrew
ridingup
to
the
officer
.
the
officer
glanced
at
him
and
without
re
plying
turned
again
to
the
soldier
.
ill
teach
you
to
push
on

repeated
prince
andrew
compressing
his
lips
.
and
who
are
you
cried
the
officer
turning
on
him
with
tipsy
rage
who
are

here
eh
i

here
not
you
go
back
or
ill
flatten

repeated
he
.
this
expression
evidently
pleased
him
.
that
was
a
nice
snub
for
the
little
aidede
camp
came
a
voice
from
behind
.
prince
andrew
saw
that
the
officer
was
in
that
state
of
senseless
tipsy
rage
when
a
man
does
not
know
what
he
is
saying
.
he
saw
that
his
championship
of
the
doctors
wife
in
her
queer
trap
might
expose
him
to
what
he
dread
ed
more
than
anything
in
the
world
to
ridi
cule
but
his
instinct
urged
him
on
.
before
the
officer
finished
his
sentence
prince
andrew
his
face
distorted
with
fury
rode
up
to
him
and
book
raised
his
riding
whip

.
ly

the
officer
flourished
his
arm
and
hastily
rode
away
.
its
all
the
fault
of
these
fellows
on
the
staff
that
theres
this
disorder
he
muttered
.
do
as
you
like
.
prince
andrew
without
lifting
his
eyes
rode
hastily
away
from
the
doctors
wife
who
was
calling
him
her
deliverer
and
recalling
with
a
sense
of
disgust
the
minutest
details
of
this
hu
miliating
scene
he
galloped
on
to
the
village
where
he
was
told
that
the
commander
in
chief
was
.
on
reaching
the
village
he
dismounted
and
went
to
the
nearest
house
intending
to
rest
if
but
for
a
moment
eat
something
and
try
to
sort
out
the
stinging
and
tormenting
thoughts
that
confused
his
mind
.
this
is
a
mob
of
scoundrels
and
not
an
army
he
was
thinking
as
he
went
up
to
the
window
of
the
first
house
when
a
familiar
voice
called
him
by
name
.
he
turned
round
.
nesvitskis
handsome
face
looked
out
of
the
little
window
.
nesvftski

he
chewed

flourishing

he
shouted
.
entering
the
house
prince
andrew
saw
nes
vftski
and
another
adjutant
having
something
to
eat
.
they
hastily
turned
round
to
him
ask
ing
if
he
had
any
news
.
on
their
familiar
faces
he
read
agitation
and
alarm
.
this
was
particu
larly
noticeable
on
nesvitskis

laugh

countenance
.
where
is
the

asked
bolk6nski

added
no

that
prince
andrew
winced
as
at
an
elec

shock
.
its

prince
andrew
.

well
all
i
canmakeout
is
that
everything

abominable
said
prince
andrew
and
he
went
off
to
the
house
where
the
commander
in
chief
was
.
passing
by
kutiizovs
carriage
and
the
ex
hausted
saddle
horses
of
his
suite
with
their
cossacks
who
were
talking
loudly
together
prince
andrew
entered
the
passage

kutuzov

the
austrian

in
the
passage
little

was
squatting
on
his
heels
in

of
a
clerk
.
the
clerk
with
cuffs
turned
up
was
hastily
writing
at
a
tub

kozlovskis

looked

he

the

at

through
the
door
came
the
sounds
of
kutu

voice
excited
and
dissatisfied
interrupted
by
another
an
unfamiliar
voice
.
from
the
sound
of
these
voices
the
inattentive
way
koz
16vski
looked
at
him
the
disrespectful
manner
of
the
exhausted
clerk
the
fact
that
the
clerk
and
kozl6vski
were
squatting
on
the
floor
by
a
tub
so
near
to
the
commander
in
chief
and
from
the
noisy
laughter
of
the
cossacks
holding
the
horses
near
the
window
prince
andrew
felt
that
something
important
and
disastrous
was
about
to
happen
.
he
turned
to
kozl6vski
with
urgent
ques

prince
andrew
moved
toward
the
door
from
war
and
peace
whence
voices
were
heard
.
just
as
he
was
going
to
open
it
the
sounds
ceased
the
door
opened
and
kutuzov
with
his
eagle
nose
and
puffy
face
appeared
in
the
doorway
.
prince
andrew
stood
right
in
front
of
kutiizov
but
the
expres
sion
of
the
commander
in
chiefs
one
sound
eye
showed
him
to
be
so
preoccupied
with
thoughts
and
anxieties
as
to
be
oblivious
of
his
presence
.
he
looked
straight
at
his
adjutants
face
with
out
recognizing
him
.
well
have
you

he
to

suddenly

and

in

with

he
made
the
sign
of

over
him
with
a
gesture
evidently
habitual
of
fering
his
puffy
cheek
but
bagrati6n
kissed
him
on

instead

they
got
into
the

and
drove
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
.
there
is
still

much
before

he
said
as
if
with
an
old
mans
penetration
he
un
derstood
all
that
was
passing
in

prince
andrew
glanced
at
kutiizovs
face
on
ly
a
foot
distant
from
him
and
involuntarily
noticed
the
carefully
washed
seams
of
the
scar
near
his
temple
where
an
ismail
bullet
had
pierced
his
skull
and
the
empty
eye
socket
.
yes
he
has
a
right
to
speak
so
calmly
of
those
mens
death
thought
bolk6nski
.
that
is
why
i
beg
to
be
sent
to
that
detach
ment
he
said
.
kutuzov
did
not
reply
.
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
what
he
had
been
saying
and
sat
plunged
in
thought
.
five
minutes
later
gently
swaying
on
the
soft
springs
of
the
carriage
he
turned
to
prince
andrew
.
there
was
not
a
trace
of
agitation
on
his
face
.
with
delicate
irony
he
questioned
prince
andrew
about
the
details
of
his
interview
with
the
emperor
about
the
remarks
he
had
heard
at
court
concerning
the
krems
affair
and
about
some
ladies
they
both
knew
.
chapter
xiv
on
november
i
kutuzov
had
received
through
a
spy
news
that
the
army
he
commanded
was
in
an
almost
hopeless
position
.
the
spy
reported
that
the
french
after
crossing
the
bridge
at
vienna
were
advancing
in
immense
force
up
on
kutiizovs
line
of
communication
with
the
troops
that
were
arriving
from
russia
.
if
ku
tuzov
decided
to
remain
at
krems
napoleons
army
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
would
cut
him
off
completely
and
surround
his
exhausted
army
of
forty
thousand
and
he
would
find
himself
in
the
position
of
mack
at
ulm
.
if
kutuzov
decided
to
abandon
the
road
connecting
him
with
the
troops
arriving
from
russia
he
would
have
to
march
with
no
road
into
unknown
parts
of
the
bohemian
moun
tains
defending
himself
against
superior
forces
of
the
enemy
and
abandoning
all
hope
of
a
junction
with
buxhowden
.
if
kutiizov
decid
ed
to
retreat
along
the
road
from
krems
to
olmiitz
to
unite
with
the
troops
arriving
from
russia
he
risked
being
forestalled
on
that
road
by
the
french
who
had
crossed
the
vienna
bridge
and
encumbered
by
his
baggage
and
transport
having
to
accept
bat
tle
on
the
march
against
an
enemy
three
times
as
strong
who
would
hem
him
in
from
two
sides
.
kutiizov
chose
this
latter
course
.
the
french
the
spy
reported
having
crossed
the
vienna
bridge
were
advancing
by
forced
marches
toward
znaim
which
lay
sixtysix
miles
off
on
the
line
of
kutiizovs
retreat
.
if
he
reached
znaim
before
the
french
there
would
be
great
hope
of
saving
the
army
to
let
the
french
forestall
him
at
znaim
meant
the
ex
posure
of
his
whole
army
to
a
disgrace
such
as
that
of
ulm
or
to
utter
destruction
.
but
to
forestall
the
french
with
his
whole
army
was
impossible
.
the
road
for
the
french
from
vi
book
two
93
enna
to
znaim
was
shorter
and
better
than
the
road
for
the
russians
from
krems
to
znaim
.
the
night
he
received
the
news
kutiizov
sent
bagrati6ns
vanguard
four
thousand
strong
to
the
right
across
the
hills
from
the
kremsznaim
to
the
viennaznaim
road
.
ba
grati6n
was
to
make
this
march
without
rest
ing
and
to
halt
facing
vienna
with
znaim
to
his
rear
and
if
he
succeeded
in
forestalling
the
french
he
was
to
delay
them
as
long
as
possible
.
kutiizov
himself
with
all
his
transport
took
the
road
to
znaim
.
marching
thirty
miles
that
stormy
night
across
roadless
hills
with
his
hungry
illshod
soldiers
and
losing
a
third
of
his
men
as
strag
glers
by
the
way
bagration
came
out
on
the
viennaznaim
road
at
hollabriinn
a
few
hours
ahead
of
the
french
who
were
approaching
hollabriinn
from
vienna
.
kutiizov
with
his
transport
had
still
to
march
for
some
days
be
fore
he
could
reach
znaim
.
hence
bagrati6n
with
his
four
thousand
hungry
exhausted
men
would
have
to
detain
for
days
the
whole
enemy
army
that
came
upon
him
at
hollabriinn
which
was
clearly
impossible
.
but
a
freak
of
fate
made
the
impossible
possible
.
the
success
of
the
trick
that
had
placed
the
vienna
bridge
in
the
hands
of
the
french
without
a
fight
led
murat
to
try
to
deceive
kutiizov
in
a
similar
way
.
meeting
bagrations
weak
detachment
on
the
znaim
road
he
supposed
it
to
be
kutiizovs
whole
army
.
to
be
able
to
crush
it
absolutely
he
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
rest
of
the
troops
who
were
on
their
way
from
vienna
and
with
this
object
offered
a
three
days
truce
on
condi
tion
that
botharmiesshould
remain
in
position
without
moving
.
murat
declared
that
negoti
ations
for
peace
were
already
proceeding
and
that
he
therefore
offered
this
truce
to
avoid
un
necessary
bloodshed

bagration
replied
that
he
was
not
authorized
either
to
accept
or
re
fuse
a
truce
and
sent
his
adjutant
to
kutiizov
to
report
the
offer
he
had
received
.
a
truce
was
kutiizovs
sole
chance
of
gain
ing
time
giving
bagrati6ns
exhausted
troops
some
rest
and
letting
the
transport
and
heavy
convoys
whose
movements
were

from

the
offer
of
a
truce
gave
the
on
ly
and
a
quite
unexpected
chance
of
saving
the
army
.
on
receiving
the
news
he
immediate
ly
dispatched
adjutant
general
wintzinger

who
was
in
attendance
on
him
to
the
en
emy
camp
.
wintzingerode
was
not
merely
to
agree
to
the
truce
but
also
to
offer
terms
of
ca
pitulation
and
meanwhile
kutiizov
sent
his

alone
covered
this

and
of
the
whole

had
to

of

eight
times
as

as

kutiizovs
expectations
that
the

of

which
were
in
no

might
give
time
for
part
of
the

to
pass
and
also
that

would

as

as

oclock
in

after

prince
andrew
who
had
persisted
in
his
request
to
kutuzov
arrived
at
grunth
and
re
ported
himself
to
bagrati6n
.
bonapartes
ad
jutant
had
not
yet
reached
murats
detach
ment
and
the
battle
had
not
yet
begun
.
in
ba
grati6ns
detachment
no
one
knew
anything
of
the
general
position
of
affairs
.
they
talked
of
peace
but
did
not
believe
in
its
possibility
oth
ers
talked
of
a
battle
but
also
disbelieved
in
the
nearness
of
an
engagement
.
bagrati6n
know
ing
bolk6nski
to
be
a
favorite
and
trusted
ad
jutant
received
him
with
distinction
and
spe
cial
marks
of
favor
explaining
to
him
that
there
would
probably
be
an
engagement
that
day
or
the
next
and
giving
him
full
liberty
to
remain
with
him
during
the
battle
or
to
join
the
rearguard
and
have
an
eye
on
the
order
of
retreat
which
is
also
very
important
.
however
there
will
hardly
be
an
engage
ment
today
said
bagrati6n
as
if
to
reassure
prince
andrew
.
if
he
is
one
of
the
ordinary
little
staff
dan
dies
sent
to
earn
a
medal
he
can
get
his
reward
just
as
well
in
the
rearguard
but
if
he
wishes
to
stay
with
me
let
him

.

.

.
hell
be
of
use
here
if
hes
a
brave
officer
thought
bagrati6n
.
prince
andrew
without
replying
asked
the
princes
permission
to
ride
round
the
position
to
see
the
disposition
of
the
forces
so
as
to
know
his
bearings
should
he
be
sent
to
execute
an
order
.
the
officer
on
duty
a
handsome
ele
gantly
dressed
man
with
a
diamond
ring
on
his
forefinger
who
was
fond
of
speaking
french
though
he
spoke
it
badly
offered
to
conduct
prince
andrew
.
on
all
sides
they
saw
rainsoaked
officers
with
dejected
faces
who
seemed
to
be
seeking
some
thing
and
soldiers
dragging
doors
benches
and
fencing
from
the
village
.
there
now
prince
we
cant
stop
those
fel
lows
said
the
staff
officer
pointing
to
the
sol
diers
.
the
officers
dont
keep
them
in
hand
.
and
there
he
pointed
to
a
sutlers
tent
they
crowd
in
and
sit
.
this
morning
i
turned
them
all
out
and
now
look
its
full
again
.
i
must
go
there
prince
and
scare
them
a
bit
.
it
wont
take
a
moment
.
yes
lets
go
in
and
i
will
get
myself
a
roll
and
some
cheese
said
prince
andrew
who
had
not
yet
had
time
to
eat
anything
.
why
didnt
you
mention
it
prince
i
would
have
offered
you
something
.
they
dismounted
and
entered
the
tent
.
sev
eral
officers
with
flushed
and
weary
faces
were
sitting
at
the
table
eating
and
drinking
.
now
what
does
this
mean
gentlemen
said
the
staff
officer
in
the
reproachful
tone
of
a
man
who
has
repeated
the
same
thing
more
than
once
.
you
know
it
wont
do
to
leave
your
posts
like
this
.
the
prince
gave
orders
that
no
one
should
leave
his
post
.
now
you
captain
and
he
turned
to
a
thin
dirty
little
artillery
of
ficer
who
without
his
boots
he
had
given
them
to
the
canteen
keeper
to
dry
in
only
his
stock
ings
rose
when
they
entered
smiling
not
alto
gether
comfortably
.
well
arent
you
ashamed
of
yourself
cap
tain
tusliin
he
continued
.
one
would
think
that
as
an
artillery
officer
you
would
set
a
good
example
yet
here
you
are
without
your
boots
the
alarm
will
be
sounded
and
youll
be
in
a
pretty
position
without
your
boots
the
staff
officer
smiled
.
kindly
return
to
your
posts
gentlemen
all
of
you
all
he
added
in
a
tone
of
command
.
prince
andrew
smiled
involuntarily
as
he
looked
at
the
artillery
officer
tushin
who
si
lent
and
smiling
shifting
from
one
stockinged
foot
to
the
other
glanced
inquiringly
with
his
large
intelligent
kindly
eyes
from
prince
an
drew
to
the
staff
officer
.
the
soldiers
say
it
feels
easier
without
boots
said
captain
tushin
smiling
shyly
in
his
uncomfortable
position
evidently
wishing
to
adopt
a
jocular
tone
.
but
before
he
had
fin
ished
he
felt
that
his
jest
was
unacceptable
and
had
not
come
off
.
he
grew
confused
.
kindly
return
to
your
posts
said
the
staff
officer
trying
to
preserve
his
gravity
.
prince
andrew
glanced
again
at
the
artillery
officers
small
figure
.
there
was
something
pe
culiar
about
it
quite
unsoldierly
rather
comic
but
extremely
attractive
.
the
staff
officer
and
prince
andrew
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
on
.
having
ridden
beyond
the
village
contin
ually
meeting
and
overtaking
soldiers
and
of
ficers
of
various
regiments
they
saw
on
their
left
some
entrenchments
being
thrown
up
the
freshly
dug
clay
of
which
showed
up
red
.
sev
eral
battalions
of
soldiers
in
their

despite
the
cold
wind
swarmed
in
these
earth
works
like
a
host
of
white
ants
spadefuls
of
red

were
continually
being
thrown
up
from
behind

by
unseen

.
prince
an
drew
and
the
officer
rode
up
looked
at
the
en

and
went
on
again
.
just
behind
it
they
came
upon
some
dozens
of
soldiers
con
tinually
replaced
by
others
who
ran
from
the
entrenchment
.
they
had
to
hold

put

and
began

the
staff

remained
behind
and
prince
andrew
rode
on
alone
.
the
farther
forward
and
nearer
the
enemy
he
went
the
more
orderly
and
cheerful
were
the

.
the
greatest
disorder
and

had
been
in

he
had
passed
that
morning
on

seven

away
from

at

also
some
ap

and

could
be
felt
but
the
nearer
prince
andrew
came
to

the

com

officers
were
counting
themen
poking
the
last
man
in
each
section
in
the
ribs
and
telling
him
to
hold
his
hand
up
.
soldiers
scattered
over
the
whole
place
were
dragging
logs
and
brushwood
and
were
building
shelters
with
merry
chatter
and

around

others

their

crowding
round

in
one
company
dinner
was
ready
and
the
soldiers
were
gazing
eagerly
at
the
steaming
boiler
waiting
till
the

a
quartermaster

was
carrying
in

to

all
their

were
as
serene
as
if
all
this
were
happening
at
home
awaiting
peaceful
encampment
and
not
within

of

of

prince

came
out
in

of
a
platoon
of
grenadiers
before
whom
lay
a
naked
man
.
two
soldiers
held
him
while
two
others
were
flourishing
their
switches
and
striking
him
regularly
on
his
bare
back
.
the
man
shrieked
unnaturally
.
a
stout
major
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
line
and
regardless
of
the
screams
kept
repeating
its
a
shame
for
a
soldier
to
steal
a
soldier
must
be
honest
honorable
and
brave
but
if

the
swishing
sound
of
the
strokes
and
the
desperate
but
unnatural
screams
continued
.

said
the
major
.
a
young
officer
with
a
bewildered
and
pained
expression
on
his
face
stepped
away
from
the
man
and
looked
round
inquiringly
at
the
ad
jutant
as
he
rode
by
.
prince
andrew
having
reached
the
front
line
rode
along
it
.
our
front
line
and
that
of
the
enemy
were
far
apart
on
the
right
and
left
flanks
but
in
the
center
where
the
men
with
a
flag
of
truce
had
passed
that
morning
the
lines
were
so
near
together
that
the
men
could
see
one
anothers
faces
and
speak
to
one
another
.
besides
the
soldiers
who
formed
the
picket
line
on
either
side
there
were
many
curious
onlook
ers
who
jesting
and
laughing
stared
at
their
strange
foreign
enemies
.
since
early
morning
despite
an
injunction
not
to
approach
the
picket
line
the
officers
had
been
unable
to
keep
sightseers
away
.
the
soldiers
forming
the
picket
line
like
showmen
exhibiting
a
curiosity
no
longer
looked
at
the
french
but
paid
attention
to
the
sightseers
and
grew
weary
waiting
to
be
relieved
.
prince

halted
to
have
a
look
at
the
french
.

one
soldier
was
saying
to
another
pointing
to
a
russian
musketeer
who
had
gone
up
to
the
picket
line
with
an
of
ficer
and
was
rapidly
and
excitedly
talking
to
a
french
grenadier
.

prince

recognized
him
and
stopped
to
listen
to
what
he
was
saying
.

was

the

bending
forward
and

the

was
incomprehensible
to
him

d61okhov
did
not

the

he
had
been
drawn
into
a
hot
dispute
with
the
french
grenadier
.
they
were
naturally
talking
about
the
campaign
.
the
frenchman
confus
ing
the
austrians
with
the
russians
was
trying
to
prove
that
the
russians
had
surrendered
and
had
fled
all
the
way
from

while
d61okhov
maintained
that

russians
had

had
beaten

said
d61okhov
.

chapter
xvi
having
ridden
round
the
whole
line
from
right
flank
to
left
prince
andrew
made
his
way
up
to
the
battery
from
which
the
staff
officer
had
told
him
the
whole
field
could
be
seen
.
here
he
dismounted
and
stopped
beside
the
farthest
of
the
four
unlimbered
cannon
.
before
theguns
an
artillery
sentry
was
pacing
up
and
down
he
stood
at
attention
when
the
officer
arrived
but
at
a
sign
resumed
his
measured
monotonous
pacing
.
behind
the
guns
were
their
limbers
and
still
farther
back
picket
ropes
and
artillery
mens
bonfires
.
to
the
left
not
far
from
the
farthest
cannon
was
a
small
newly
constructed
wattle
shed
from
which
came
the
sound
of
of
ficers
voices
in
eager
conversation
.
it
was
true
that
a
view
over
nearly
the
whole
russian
position
and
the
greater
part
of
the
enemys
opened
out
from
this
battery
.
just
fac
ing
it
on
the
crest
of
the
opposite
hill
the
vil
lage
of
schon
grabern
could
be
seen
and
in
three
places
to
left
and
right
the
french
troops
amid
the
smoke
of
their
campfires
the
greater
part
of
whom
were
evidently
in
the
village
it
self
and
behind
the
hill
.
to
the
left
from
that
village
amid
the
smoke
was
something
resem
bling
a
battery
but
it
was
impossible
to
see
it
clearly
with
the
naked
eye
.
our
right
flank
was
posted
on
a
rather
steep
incline
which
domi
nated
the
french
position
.
our
infantry
were
stationed
there
and
at
the
farthest
point
the
dragoons
.
in
the
center
where
tiishins
bat
tery
stood
and
from
which
prince
andrew
was
surveying
the
position
was
the
easiest
and
most
direct
descent
and
ascent
to
the
brook
separat
ing
us
from
schon
grabern
.
on
the
left
our
troops
were
close
to
a
copse
in
which
smoked
the
bonfires
of
our
infantry
who
were
felling
wood
.
the
french
line
was
wider
than
ours
and
it
was
plain
that
they
could
easily
outflank
us
on
both
sides
.
behind
our
position
was
a
steep
and
deep
dip
making
it
difficult
for
ar
tillery
and
cavalry
to
retire
.
prince
andrew
took
out
his
notebook
and
leaning
on
the
can
non
sketched
a
plan
of
the
position
.
he
made
some
notes
on
two
points
intending
to
men
tion
them
to
bagrati6n
.
his
idea
was
first
to
concentrate
all
the
artillery
in
the
center
and
secondly
to
withdraw
the
cavalry
to
the
other
side
of
the
dip
.
prince
andrew
being
always
book
two

near
the
commander
in
chief
closely
follow
ing
the
mass
movements
and
general
orders
and
constantly
studying
historical
accounts
of
battles
involuntarily
pictured
to
himself
the
course
of
events
in
the
forthcoming
action
in
broad
outline
.
he
imagined
only
important
possibilities
if
the
enemy
attacks
the
right
flank
he
said
to
himself
the
kiev
grenadiers
and
the
pod61sk
chasseurs
must
hold
their
po
sition
till
reserves
from
the
center
come
up
.
in
that
case
the
dragoons
could
successfully
make
a
flank
counterattack
.
if
they
attack
our
center
we
having
the
center
battery
on
this
high
ground
shall
withdraw
the
left
flank
under
its
cover
and
retreat
to
the
dip
by
echelons
.
so
he
reasoned
.

..
.
all
the
time
he
had
been
be
side
the
gun
he
had
heard
the
voices
of
the
offi
cers
distinctly
but
as
often
happens
had
not
understood
a
word
of
what
they
were
saying
.
suddenly
however
he
was
struck
by
a
voice
coming
from
the
shed
and
its
tone
was
so
sin
cere
that
he
could
not
but
listen
.
no
friend
said
a
pleasant
and
as
it
seemed
to
prince
andrew
a
familiar
voice
what
i
say
is
that
if
it
were
possible
to
know
what
is
beyond
death
none
of
us
would
be
afraid
of
it
.
thats
so
friend
.
another
a
younger
voice
interrupted
him
afraid
or
not
you
cant
escape
it
anyhow
.
all
the
same
one
is
afraid
oh
you
clever
people
said
a
third
manly
voice
interrupt
ing
them
both
.
of
course
you
artillery
men
are
very
wise
because
you
can
take
everything
along
with
you
vodka
and
snacks
.
and
the
owner
of
the
manly
voice
evidently
an
infantry
officer
laughed
.
yes
one
is
afraid
continued
the
first
speak
er
he
of
the
familiar
voice
.
one
is
afraid
of
the
unknown
thats
what
it
is
.
whatever
we
may
say
about
the
soul
going
to
the
sky

..
.
we
know
there
is
no
sky
but
only
an
atmosphere
.
the
manly
voice
again
interrupted
the
ar
tillery
officer
.
well
stand
us
some
of
your
herb
vodka
tushin
it
said
.
why
thought
prince
andrew
thats
the
captain
who
stood
up
in
the
sutlers
hut
with
out
his
boots
.
he
recognized
the
agreeable
philosophizing
voice
with
pleasure
.
some
herb
vodka
certainly
1
said
tiishin
.
but
still
to
conceive
a
future
life

.

.

.
he
did
not
finish
.
just
then
there
was
a
whis
tle
in
the
air
nearer
and
nearer
faster
and
louder
louder
and
faster
a
cannon
ball
as
if
it
had
not
finished
saying
what
was
necessary
thudded
into
the
ground
near
the
shed
with
superhuman
force
throwing
up
a
mass
of
earth
.
the
ground
seemed
to
groan
at
the
terrible
im
pact
.
and
immediately
tiishin
with
a
short
pipe
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
his
kind
intel
ligent
face
rather
pale
rushed
out
of
the
shed
followed
by
the
owner
of
the
manly
voice
a
dashing
infantry
officer
who
hurried
off
to
his
company
buttoning
up
his
coat
as
he
ran
.
chapter

mounting
his
horse
again
prince
andrew
lin
gered
with
the
battery
looking
at
the
puff
from
the
gun
that
had
sent
the
ball
.
his
eyes
ran
rapidly
over
the
wide
space
but
he
only
saw
that
the
hitherto
motionless
masses
of
the
french
now
swayed
and
that
there
really
was
a
battery
to
their
left
.
the
smoke
above
it
had
not
yet
dispersed
.
two
mounted
frenchmen
probably
adjutants
were
galloping
up
the
hill
.
a
small
but
distinctly
visible
enemy
column
was
moving
down
the
hill
probably
to
strength
en
the
front
line
.
the
smoke
of
the
first
shot

not

dispersed
before
another
puff

peared
followed
by
a
report

prince
andrew
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
back
to
grunth
to
find
prince
bagra
tion
.
he
heard
the
cannonade
behind
him
growing
louder
and
more
frequent
.
evidently
our
guns
had
begun
to
reply
.
from
the
bottom
of
the
slope
where
the
parleys
had
taken
place
came
the
report
of
musketry
.
lemarrois

just
arrived
at
a
gallop
with
bonapartes
stern
letter
and
murat
humili
ated
and
anxious
to
expiate
his
fault
had
at
once
moved
his
forces
to
attack
the
center
and
outflank
both
the
russian
wings
hoping
be
fore
evening
and
before
the
arrival
of
the
em
peror
to
crush
the
contemptible
detachment
that
stood
before
him
.
it
has
begun
.
here
it
is
thought
prince
andrew
feeling
the
blood
rush
to
his
heart
.
but
where
and
how
will
my
toulon
present
itself
passing
between
the
companies
that
had
been
eating
porridge
and
drinking
vodka
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
he
saw
everywhere
the
same
rapid
movement
of
soldiers
forming
ranks
and
getting
their
muskets
ready
and
on
all
their
faces
he
recognized
the
same
eagerness
that
filled
his
heart
.
it
has
begun
here
it
is
dread
ful
but
enjoyable
was
what
the
face
of
each
soldier
and
each
officer
seemed
to
say
.
before
he
had
reached
the
embankments
that
were
being
thrown
up
he
saw
in
the
light
of
the
dull
autumn
evening
mounted
men
com
war
and
peace
ing
toward
him
.
the
foremost
wearing
a
cos
sack
cloak
and
lambskin
cap
and
riding
a
white
horse
was
prince
bagrati6n
.
prince
an
drew
stopped
waiting
for
him
to
come
up
prince
bagrati6n
reined
in
his
horse
and
recog
nizing
prince
andrew
nodded
to
him
.
he
still
looked
ahead
while
prince
andrew
told
him
what
he
had
seen
.
the
feeling
it
has
begun
here
it
is
was
seen
even
on
prince
bagrati6ns
hard
brown
face
with
its
halfclosed
dull
sleepy
eyes
.
prince
andrew
gazed
with
anxious
curiosity
at
that
impassive
face
and
wished
he
could
tell
what
if
anything
this
man
was
thinking
and
feeling
at
that
moment
.
is
there
anything
at
all
be
hind
that
impassive
face
prince
andrew
asked
himself
as
he
looked
.
prince
bagrati6n
bent
his
head
in
sign
of
agreement
with
what
prince
andrew
told
him
and
said
very
good
in
a
tone
that
seemed
to
imply
that
everything
that
took
place
and
was
reported
to
him
was
exact
ly
what
he
had
foreseen
.
prince
andrew
out
of
breath
with
his
rapid
ride
spoke
quickly
.
prince
bagrati6n
uttering
his
words
with
an
oriental
accent
spoke
particularly
slowly
as
if
to
im
press
the
fact
that
there
was
no
need
to
hurry
.
however
he
put
his
horse
to
a
trot
in
the
di
rection
of

battery
.
prince
andrew
fol
lowed
with
the
suite
.
behind
prince
bagrati6n
rode
an
officer
of
the
suite
the
princes
per
sonal
adjutant
zherkriv
an
orderly
officer
the
staff
officer
on
duty
riding
a
fine
bobtailed
horse
and
a
civilian
an
accountant
who
had
asked
permission
to
be
present
at
the
battle
out
of
curiosity
.
the
accountant
a
stout
full
faced
man
looked
around
him
with
a
naive
smile
of
satisfaction
and
presented
a
strange
appearance
among
the
hussars
cossacks
and
adjutants
in
his
camlet
coat
as
he
jolted
on
his
horse
with
a
convoy
officers
saddle
.
he
wants
to
see
a
battle
said
zherk6v
to
bolk6nski
pointing
to
the
accountant
but
he
feels
a
pain
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
al
ready
.
oh
leave
off
said
the
accountant
with
a
beaming
but
rather
cunning
smile
as
if
flat
tered
at
being
made
the
subject
of
zherk6vs
joke
and
purposely
trying
to
appear
stupider
than
he
really
was
.
it
is
very
strange
mon
monsieur
prince
said
the
staff
officer
.
he
remembered
that
in
french
there
is
some
peculiar
way
of
address
ing
a
prince
but
could
not
get
it
quite
right
.
by
this
time
they
were
all
approaching
tu
shins
battery
and
a
ball
struck
the
ground
in
front
of
them
.
whats
that
that
has
fallen
asked
the
ac
countant
with
a
naive
smile
.
a
french
pancake
answered
zherk6v
.
so
thats
what
they
hit
with
asked
the
ac
countant
.
how
awful
he
seemed
to
swell
with
satisfaction
.
he
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
they
again
heard
an
unexpectedly
violent
whistling
which
sud
denly
ended
with
a
thud
into
something
soft

.

.

.
ffflop
and
a
cossack
riding
a
little
to
their
right
and
behind
the
accountant
crashed
to
earth
with
his
horse
.
zherkov
and
the
staff
officer
bent
over
their
saddles
and
turned
their
horses
away
.
the
accountant
stopped
facing
the
cossack
and
examined
him
with
attentive
curiosity
.
the
cossack
was
dead
but
the
horse
still
struggled
.
prince
bagrati6n
screwed
up
his
eyes
looked
round
and
seeing
the
cause
of
the
confusion
turned
away
with
indifference
as
if
to
say
is
it
worth
while
noticing
trifles
he
reined
in
his
horse
with
the
ease
of
a
skillful
rider
and
slightly
bending
over
disengaged
his
saber
which
had
caught
in
his
cloak
.
it
was
an
old
fashioned
saber
of
a
kind
no
longer
in
general
use
.
prince
andrew
remembered
the
story
of
suvorov
giving
his
saber
to
bagrati6n
in
italy
and
the
recollection
was
particularly
pleasant
at
that
moment
.
they
had
reached
the
battery
at
which
prince
andrew
had
been
when
he
ex
amined
the
battlefield
.
whose
company
asked
prince
bagrati6n
of
an
artilleryman
standing
by
the
ammuni
tion
wagon
.
he
asked
whose
company
but
he
really
meant
are
you
frightened
here
and
the
artilleryman
understood
him
.

in
a

yes
yes
muttered
bagrati6n
as
if
consid
ering
something
and
he
rode
past
the
limbers
to
the
farthest
cannon
.
as
he
approached
a
ringing
shot
issued
from
it
deafening
him
and
his
suite
and
in
the
smoke
that
suddenly
surrounded
the
gun
they
could
see
the
gunners
who
had
seized
it
straining
to
roll
it
quickly
back
to
its
former
position
.
a

holding
a

his

apart

to

the

captain

stumbling
over
the
tail
of
the
gun
carriage
moved
forward
and
not
noticing

general
looked

his
eyes
with
his
small
hand

approached
the

.
though
tushins

had
been
in

he
was
firing
incendiary
balls
at
the
village
of
schon

visible
just
opposite
in
front
of
which
large
masses
of
french
were
advancing
.
no
one
had
given
tushin

and
at

to

but
after
consulting
his
ser
geant
major
zakharchenko
for
whom
he
had

he
had

that
it
would
be

to
the
village
.
very
good
i
said
bagrati6n
in
reply
to
the
officers
report
and
began
deliberately
to
examine
the
whole
battlefield
extended
before
him
.
the
french
had
advanced
nearest
on
our
right
.
be
low
the
height
on
which
the
kiev
regiment
was
stationed
in
the
hollow
where
the
rivulet
flowed
the
soulstirring
rolling
and
crackling
of
musketry
was
heard
and
much
farther
to
the
right
beyond
the
dragoons
the
officer
of
the
suite
pointed
out
to
bagration
a
french
column
that
was
outflanking
us
.
to
the
left
the
horizon
was
bounded
by
the
adjacent
wood
.
prince
bagrad6n
ordered
two
battalions
from
the
center
to
be
sent
to
reinforce
the
right
flank
.
the
officer
of
the
suite
ventured
to
re
mark
to
the
prince
that
if
these
battalions
went
away
the
guns
would
remain
without
support
.
prince
bagrati6n
turned
to
the
officer
and
with
his
dull
eyes
looked
at
him
in
silence
.
it
seemed
to
prince
andrew
that
the
officers
remark
was
just
and
that
really
no
answer
could
be
made
to
it
.
but
at
that
moment
an
adjutant
galloped
up
with
a
message
from
the
commander
of
the
regiment
in
the
hollow
and
news
that
immense
masses
of
the
french
were
coming
down
upon
them
and
that
his
regiment
was
in
disorder
and
was
retreating
upon
the
kiev
grenadiers
.
prince
bagration
bowed
his
head
in
sign
of
as
sent
and
approval
.
he
rode
off
at
a
walk
to
the
right
and
sent
an
adjutant
to
the
dragoons
with
orders
to
attack
the
french
.
but
this
ad
jutant
returned
half
an
hour
later
with
the
news
that
the
commander
of
the
dragoons
had
already
retreated
beyond
the
dip
in
the
ground
as
a
heavy
fire
had
been
opened
on
him
and
he
was
losing
men
uselessly
and
so
had
hastened
to
throw
some
sharpshooters
into
the
wood
.
very
good
said
bagrati6n
.
as
he
was
leaving
the
battery
firing
was
heard
on
the
left
also
and
as
it
was
too
far
to
the
left
flank
for
him
to
have
time
to
go
there
himself
prince
bagrati6n
sent
zherk6v
to
tell
the
gen
eral
in
command
the
one
who
had
paraded
his
regiment
before
kutuzov
at
braunau
that
he
must
retreat
as
quickly
as
possible
behind
the
hollow
in
the
rear
as
the
right
flank
would
probably
not
be
able
to
withstand
the
enemys
attack
very
long
.
about
tushin
and
the
bat
talion
that
had
been
in
support
of
his
battery
all
was
forgotten
.
prince
andrew
listened
at
tentively
to
bagrati6ns
colloquies
with
the
commanding
officers
and
the
orders
he
gave
them
and
to
his
surprise
found
that
no
orders
were
really
given
but
that
prince
bagrati6n
tried
to
make
it
appear
that
everything
done
by
necessity
by
accident
or
by
the
will
of
sub
ordinate
commanders
was
done
if
not
by
his
direct
command
at
least
in
accord
with
his
in
tentions
.
prince
andrew
noticed
however
that
though
what
happened
was
due
to
chance
and
was
independent
of
the
commanders
will
ow
ing
to
the
tact
bagrati6n
showed
his
presence
was
very
valuable
.
officers
who
approached
him
with
disturbed
countenances
became
calm
sol
diers
and
officers
greeted
him
gaily
grew
more
cheerful
in
his
presence
and
were
evidently
anxious
to
display
their
courage
before
him
.
chapter
xviii
prince
bagration
having
reached
the
high
est
point
of
our
right
flank
began
riding
down
hill
to
where
the
roll
of
musketry
was
heard
but
where
on
account
of
the
smoke
nothing
could
be
seen
.
the
nearer
they
got
to
the
hol
low
the
less
they
could
see
but
the
more
they
felt
the
nearness
of
the
actual
battlefield
.
they
began
to
meet
wounded
men
.
one
with
a
bleeding
head
and
no
cap
was
being
dragged
along
by
two
soldiers
who
supported
him
un
der
the
arms
.
there
was
a
gurgle
in
his
throat
and
he
was
spitting
blood
.
a
bullet
had
evi
dently
hit
him
in
the
throat
or
mouth
.
another
was
walking
sturdily
by
himself
but
without
his
musket
groaning
aloud
and
swinging
his
ann
which
had
just
been
hurt
while
blood
from
it
was
streaming
over
his
greatcoat
as
from
a
bottle
.
he
had
that
moment
been
wounded
and
his
face
showed
fear
rather
than
suffering
.
crossing
a
road
they
descended
a
steep
incline
and
saw
several
men
lying
on
the
ground
they
also
met
a
crowd
of
soldiers
some
of
whom
were
unwounded
.
the
soldiers
were
ascending
the
hill
breathing
heavily
and
de
1oo
war
and
peace
spite
the
generals
presence
were
talking
loud
ly
and
gesticulating
.
in
front
of
them
rows
of
gray
cloaks
were
already
visible
through
the
smoke
and
an
officer
catching
sight
of
bagra
ti6n
rushed
shouting
after
the
crowd
of
retreat
ing
soldiers
ordering
them
back
.
bagrati6n
rode
up
to
the
ranks
along
which
shots
crackled
now
here
and
now
there
drowning
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
shouts
of
command
.
the
whole
air
reeked
with
smoke
.
the
excited
faces
of
the
soldiers
were
blackened
with
it
.
some
were
using
their
ramrods
others
putting
powder
on
the
touchpans
or
taking
charges
from
their
pouches
while
others
were
firing
though
who
they
were
firing
at
could
not
be
seen
for
the
smoke
which
there
was
no
wind
to
carry
away
.
a
pleasant
humming
and
whistling
of
bullets
were
often
heard
.
what
is
this
thought
prince
andrew
approaching
the
crowd
of
sol
diers
.
it
cant
be
an
attack
for
they
are
not
moving
it
cant
be
a
squarefor
they
are
not
drawn
up
for
that
.
the
commander
of
the
regiment
a
thin
feeblelooking
old
man
with
a
pleasant
smile
his
eyelids
drooping
more
than
half
over
his
old
eyes
giving
him
a
mild
expression
rode
up
to
bagrati6n
and
welcomed
him
as
a
host
wel
comes
an
honored
guest
.
he
reported
that
his
regiment
had
been
attacked
by
french
cavalry
and
that
though
the
attack
had
been
repulsed
he
had
lost
more
than
half
his
men
.
he
said
the
attack
had
been
repulsed
employing
this
military
term
to
describe
what
had
occurred
to
his
regiment
but
in
reality
he
did
not
himself
know
what
had
happened
during
that
half
hour
to
the
troops
entrusted
to
him
and
could
not
say
with
certainty
whether
the
attack
had
been
repulsed
or
his
regiment
had
been
bro
ken
up
.
all
he
knew
was
that
at
the
commence
ment
of
the
action
balls
and
shells
began
fly
ing
all
over
his
regiment
and
hitting
men
and
that
afterwards
someone
had
shouted
caval
ry
and
our
men
had
begun
firing
.
they
were
still
firing
not
at
the
cavalry
which
had
disap
peared
but
at
french
infantry
who
had
come
into
the
hollow
and
were
firing
at
our
men
.
prince
bagration
bowed
his
head
as
a
sign
that
this
was
exactly
what
he
had
desired
and
ex
pected
.
turning
to
his
adjutant
he
ordered
him
to
bring
down
the
two
battalions
of
the
sixth
chasseurs
whom
they
had
just
passed
.
prince
andrew
was
struck
by
the
changed
ex
pression
on
prince
bagrati6ns
face
at
this
mo
ment
.
it
expressed
the
concentrated
and
hap
py
resolution
you
see
on
the
face
of
a
man
who
on
a
hot
day
takes
a
final
run
before
plunging
into
the
water
.
the
dull
sleepy
expression
was
no
longer
there
nor
the
affectation
of
pro
found
thought
.
the
round
steady
hawks
eyes
looked
before
him
eagerly
and
rather
disdain
fully
not
resting
on
anything
although
his
movements
were
still
slow
and
measured
.
the
commander
of
the
regiment
turned
to
prince
bagration
entreating
him
to
go
back
as
it
was
too
dangerous
to
remain
where
they
were
.
please
your
excellency
for
godssake
he
kept
saying
glancing
for
support
at
an
of
ficer
of
the
suite
who
turned
away
from
him
.
there
you
see
and
he
drew
attention
to
the
bullets
whistling
singing
and
hissing
continu
ally
around
them
.
he
spote
in
the
tone
of
en
treaty
and
reproach
that
a
carpenter
uses
to
a
gentleman
who
has
picked
up
an
ax
we
are
used
to
it
but
you
sir
will
blister
your
hands
.
he
spoke
as
if
those
bullets
could
not
kill
him
and
his
halfclosed
eyes
gave
still
more
persua
siveness
to
his
words
.
the
staff
officer
joined
in
the
colonels
appeals
but
bagrati6n
did
not
re
ply
he
only
gave
an
order
to
cease
firing
and
reform
so
as
to
give
room
for
the
two
ap
proaching
battalions
.
while
he
was
speaking
the
curtain
of
smoke
that
had
concealed
the
hollow
driven
by
a
rising
wind
began
to
move
from
right
to
left
as
if
drawn
by
an
invisible
hand
and
the
hill
opposite
with
the
french
moving
about
on
it
opened
out
before
them
.
all
eyes
fastened
involuntarily
on
this
french
column
advancing
against
them
and
winding
down
over
the
uneven
ground
.
one
could
al
ready
see
the
soldiers
shaggy
caps
distinguish
the
officers
from
the
men
and
see
the
standard
flapping
against
its
staff
.
they
march
splendidly
remarked
some
one
in
bagrati6ns
suite
.
the
head
of
the
column
had
already
de
scended
into
the
hollow
.
the
clash
would
take
place
on
this
side
of
it
the
remains
of
our
regiment
which
had
been
in
action
rapidly
formed
up
and
moved
to
the
right
from
behind
it
dispersing
the
laggards
came
two
battalions
of
the
sixth
chasseurs
in
fine
order
.
before
they
had
reached
bagration
the
weighty
tread
of
the
mass
of
men
marching
in
step
could
be
heard
.
on
their
left
flank
near
est
to
bagrati6n
marched
a
company
command
er
a
fine
roundfaced
man
with
a
stupid
and
happy
expressionthe
same
man
who
had
rushed
out
of
the
wattle
shed
.
at
that
moment
he
was
clearly
thinking
of
nothing
but
how
dashing
a
fellow
he
would
appear
as
he
passed
the
commander
.
with
the
selfsatisfaction
of
a
man
on
pa
book
two
rade
he
stepped
lightly
with
his
muscular
legs
as
if
sailing
along
stretching
himself
to
his
full
height
without
the
smallest
effort
his
ease
con
trasting
with
the
heavy
tread
of
the
soldiers
who
were
keeping
step
with
him
.
he
carried
close
to
his
leg
a
narrow
unsheathed
sword
small
curved
and
not
like
a
real
weapon
and
looked
now
at
the
superior
officers
and
now
back
at
the
men
without
losing
step
his
whole
powerful
body
turning
flexibly
.
it
was
as
if
all
the
powers
of
his
soul
were
concentrated
on
passing
the
commander
in
the
best
possible
manner
and
feeling
that
he
was
doing
it
well
he
was
happy
.

the
french
were
putting
out
the
fire
which
the
wind
was
spreading
and
thus
gave
us
time
to
retreat
.
the
retirement
of
the
center
to
the

side
of
the
dip
in
the
ground
at
the
rear
was
hurried
and
noisy
but
the

did
not

mixed

but
our
left
which
consisted
of
the

was
simultaneously
attacked

had
sent

to

with
orders
to
retreat
immediately

zherk6v
not
removing
his

from

turned
his
horse
about
and
galloped
off
.
but
no
sooner
had
he
left
bagrati6n
than
his
courage
failed
him
.
he
was
seized
by
panic
and
could
not
go
where
it
was
dangerous
.
having
reached
the
left
flank
instead
of

the

by

to
the
commander
of

reviewed
at
braunau
and
in

d61okhovwas

the

had
been
as
signed
to
the
commander
of
the
pdvlograd
regi
ment
in
which
rost6v
was
serving
and
a
mis
understanding
arose
.
the
two
commanders
were
much
exasperated
with
one
another
and
long
after
the
action
had
begun
on
the
right
flank
and
the
french
were
already
advancing
were
engaged
in
discussion
with

sole
ob

of
offending

but
the
regi

both
cavalry
and

were
by
no
means
ready
for
the
impending

from

they

the
general
expanded
his

and
rode
frowning
beside
him
to
the

as
if
their
differences
would
be
settled
there
amongst
the
bullets

they
reached
the

several
bullets
sped
over
them
and
they
halted
in
silence
.
there
was
nothing
fresh
to
be
seen
from
the
line
for
from
where
they
had
been
before
it
had
been
evident
that
it
was
im
possible
for
cavalry
to
act
among
the

as
well
as
that
the
french
were

both
passed
the

successfully
.
as
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
and
neither
wished
to
give
occasion
for
it
to
be
al
leged
that
he
had
been

to
leave

fire
they
would
have
remained
there
for
a
long
time
testing
each
others
courage
had
it
not
been
that
just
then
they
heard
the
rattle
of
musketry
and
a
muffled
shout
almost
behind
them
in
the
wood
.
the
french
had
at
tacked
the
men
collecting
wood
in
the
copse
.
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
the
hussars
to
re
treat
with
the
infantry
.
they
were
cut
off
from
the
line
of
retreat
on
the
left
by
the
french
.
however
inconvenient
the
position
it
was
now
necessary
to
attack
in
order
to
cut
away
through
for
themselves
.
the
squadron
in
which
rost6v
was
serving
had
scarcely
time
to
mount
before
it
was
halted
facing
the
enemy
.
again
as
at
the
enns
bridge
there
was
nothing
between
the
squadron
and
the
enemy
and
again
that
terrible
dividing
line
of
uncertainty
and
fearresembling
the
line
separating
the
living
from
the
dead
lay
between
them
.
all
were
conscious
of
this
un
seen
line
and
the
question
whether
they
would
cross
it
or
not
and
how
they
would
cross
it
agitated
them
all
.
the
colonel
rode
to
the
front
angrily
gave
some
reply
to
questions
put
to
him
by
the
of
ficers
and
like
a
man
desperately
insisting
on
having
his
own
way
gave
an
order
.
no
one
said
anything
definite
but
the
rumor
of
an
at
tack
spread
through
the
squadron
.
the
com
mand
to
form
up
rang
out
and
the
sabers
whizzed
as
they
were
drawn
from
their
scab
bards
.
still
no
one
moved
.
the
troops
of
the
left
flank
infantry
and
hussars
alike
felt
that
the
commander
did
not
himself
know
what
to
do

before
him
on
the
right
rost6v
saw
the
front
lines
of
his
hussars
and
still
farther
ahead
a
dark
line
which
he
could
not
see
distinctly
but
took
to
be
the
enemy
.
shots
could
be
heard
but
some
way
off
.
faster
came
the
word
of
command
and
rost6v
felt
rooks
flanks
drooping
as
he
broke
into
a
gallop
.
rost6v
anticipated
his
horses
movements
and
became
more
and
more
elated
.
he
had
noticed
a
solitary
tree
ahead
of
him
.
this
tree
had
been
in
the
middle
of
the
line
that
had
seemed
so
terrible
and
now
he
had
crossed
that
line
and
not
only
was
there
nothing
ter
rible
but
everything
was
becoming
more
and
more
happy
and
animated
.
oh
how
i
will
slash
at
him
thought
rost6v
gripping
the
hilt
of
his
saber
.
huraaaah
came
a
roar
of
voices
.
let
anyone
come
my
way
now
thought
rost6v
driving
his
spurs
into
rook
and
letting
him
go
at
a
full
gallop
so
that
he
outstripped
the
oth
ers
.
ahead
the
enemy
was
already
visible
.
sud
denly
something
like
a
birch
broom
seemed
to
sweep
over
the
squadron
.
rost6v
raised
his
sa
ber
ready
to
strike
but
at
that
instant
the
trooper
nikitenko
who
was
galloping
ahead
shot
away
from
him
and
rost6v
felt
as
in
a
dream
that
he
continued
to
be
carried
forward
with
unnatural
speed
but
yet
stayed
on
the
same
spot
.
from
behind
him
bondarchuk
an
hussar
he
knew
jolted
against
him

looked
angrily

rost6v
asked
and
answered
at
the
same
instant
.
he
was
alone
in
the
middle
of
a
field
.
instead
of
the
moving
horses
and
hussars
backs
he
saw
nothing
before
him
but
the
mo
tionless
earth
and
the
stubble
around
him
.
there
was

blood
under
his
arm

sharply
divided

armies
he
asked
him

and
could
not
answer
.
can
something
bad
have
happened
to
me
he
wondered
as
he
got
up
and
at
that
moment
he
felt
that
some
thing
superfluous
was
hangingon
his
benumbed
left
arm
.
the
wrist
felt
as
if
it
were
not
his
.
he
examined
his
hand
carefully
vainly
trying
to
find
blood
on
it
.
ah
here
are
people
com
ing
he
thought
joyfully
seeing
some
men
run
ning
toward
him
.
they
will
help
me
in
front
came
a
man
wearing
a
strange
shako
and
a
blue
cloak
swarthy
sunburned
and
with
a
hooked
nose
.
then
came
two
more
and
many
more
running
behind
.
one
of
them
said
some
thing
strange
not
in
russian
.
in
among
the
hindmost
of
these
men
wearing
similar
shakos
was
a
russian
hussar
.
he
was
being
held
by
the
arms
and
his
horse
was
being
led
behind
him
.
it
must
be
one
of
ours
a
prisoner
.
yes
.
can
it
be
that
they
will
take
me
too
who
are
these
men
thought
rost6v
scarcely
believing
his
eyes
.
can
they
be
french
he
looked
at
the
approaching
frenchmen
and
though
but
a
moment
before
he
had
been
galloping
to
get
at
them
and
hack
them
to
pieces
their
proximity
now
seemed
so
awful
that
he
could
not
believe
his
eyes
.
who
are
they
why
are
they
run
ning
can
they
be
coming
at
me
and
why
to
kill
me
me
whom
everyone
is
so
fond
of
he
remembered
his
mothers
love
for
him
and
his
familys
and
his
friends
and
the
enemys
in
tention
to
kill
him
seemed
impossible
.
but
perhaps
they
may
do
it
for
more
than
ten
seconds
he
stood
not
moving
from
the
spot
or
realizing
the
situation
.
the
foremost
french
man
the
one
with
the
hooked
nose
was
al
ready
so
close
that
the
expression
of
his
face
could
be
seen
.
and
the
excited
alien
face
of
that
man
his
bayonet
hanging
down
holding
his
breath
and
running
so
lightly
frightened
rost6v
.
he
seized
his
pistol
and
instead
of
fir
ing
it
flung
it
at
the
frenchman
and
ran
with
all
his
might
toward
the
bushes
.
he
did
not
now
run
with
the
feeling
of
doubt
and
conflict
with
which
he
had
trodden
the
enns
bridge
but
with
the
feeling
of
a
hare
fleeing
from
the
hounds
.
one
single
sentiment
that
of
fear
for
his
young
and
happy
life
possessed
his
whole
being
.
rapidly
leaping
the
furrows
he
fled
across
the
field
with
the
impetuosity
he
used
to
show
at
catchplay
now
and
then

a

terror
went
through
him
no

not

he
thought
but
having
reached
the
bushes
he
glanced
round
once
more
.
the
french
had
fallen
behind
and
just
as
he
looked
round
the
first
man
changed
his
run
to
a
walk
and
turning
shouted
something
loudly
to
a

farther
back

but
at
the

time
his

felt
as
heavy
as
if
a

were
tied
to
it

he
could
run
no

the

also
stopped
and
took

closed

stooped

and
then

him

he
mustered
his
last
remaining
strength
took
hold
of
his

with
his
right
and
reached
the
bushes
.
behind
these
were

shooters

chapter

the
infantry
regiments
that
had
been
caught
unawares
in
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
ran
out
of
it
the
different
companies
getting
mixed
and
retreated
as
a
disorderly
crowd
.
one
sol
dier
in
his
fear
uttered
the
senseless
cry
cut

that
is
so
terrible
in

and
that
word
infected
the
whole
crowd
with
a
feeling
of
panic
.
surrounded
cut
off
were
lost
shouted
the
fugitives
.
the
moment
he
heard
the
firing
and
the
cry
from
behind
the
general
realized
that
some
thing
dreadful
had
happened
to
his
regiment
and
the
thought
that
he
an
exemplary
officer
of
many
years
service
who
had
never
been
to
blame
might
be
held
responsible
at
headquar
ters
for
negligence
or
inefficiency
so
staggered
him
that
forgetting
the
recalcitrant
cavalry
colonel
his
own
dignity
as
a
general
and
above
all
quite
forgetting
the
danger
and
all
regard
for
selfpreservation
he
clutched
the
crupper
of
his
saddle
and
spurring
his
horse
galloped
to
the
regiment
under
a
hail
of
bullets
which
fell
around
but
fortunately
missed
him
.
his
one
desire
was
to
know
what
was
happening
and
at
any
cost
correct
or
remedy
the
mistake
if
he
had
made
one
so
that
he
an
exemplary
officer
of
twentytwo
years
service
who
had
never
been
censured
should
not
be
held
to
blame
.
having
galloped
safely
through
the
french
he
reached
afield
behind
the
copse
across
which
our
men
regardless
of
orders
were
running
and
descending
the
valley
.
that
moment
of
moral
hesitation
which

the
fate
of

had
arrived
.
would
this
disorderly
crowd
of
soldiers
attend
to
the
voice
of
their
command
er
or
would
they
disregarding
him
continue
their
flight
despite
his
desperate
shouts
that
used
to
seem
so
terrible
to
the
soldiers
despite
his
furious
purple
countenance
distorted
out
of
all
likeness
to
his
former
self
and
the
flour
ishing
of
his
saber
the
soldiers
all
continued
to
run
talking
firing
into
the
air
and
disobeying
orders
.
the
moral
hesitation
which
decided
the
fate
of
battles
was
evidently
culminating
in
a
panic
.
the
general
had
a
fit
of
coughing
as
a
result
of
shouting
and
of
the
powder
smoke
and
stopped
in
despair
.
everything
seemed
lost
.
but
at
that
moment
the
french
who
were
attack
ing
suddenly
and
without
any
apparent
rea
son
ran
back
and
disappeared
from
the
out
skirts
and
russian
sharpshooters
showed
them
selves
in
the
copse
.
it
was
tim6khins
com
pany
which
alone
had
maintained
its
order
in
the
wood
and
having
lain
in
ambush
in
a
ditch
now
attacked
the
french
unexpectedly
.
tim6khin
armed
only
with
a
sword
had
rushed
at
the
enemy
with
such
a
desperate
cry
and
such
mad
drunken
determination
that
taken
by
surprise
the
french
had
thrown
down
their
muskets
and
run
.
d61okhov
running
beside
timtikhin
killed
a
frenchman
at
close
quar
ters
and
was
the
first
to
seize
the
surrendering
french
officer
by
his
collar
.
our
fugitives
re
turned
the
battalions
reformed
and
the
french
who
had
nearly
cut
our
left
flank
in
half
were
for
the
moment
repulsed
.
our
re
serve
units
were
able
to
join
up
and
the
fight
was
at
an
end
.
the
regimental
commander
and
major
ekon6mov
had
stopped
beside
a
bridge
letting
the
retreating
companies
pass
by
them
when
a
soldier
came
up
and
took
hold
of
the
commanders
stirrup
almost
leaning
against
him
.
the
man
was
wearing
a
bluish
coat
of
broadcloth
he
had
no
knapsack
or
cap
his
head
was
bandaged
and
over
his
shoulder
a
french
munition
pouch
was
slung
.
he
had
an
officers
sword
in
his
hand
.
the
soldier
was
pale
his
blue
eyes
looked
impudently
into
the
commanders
face
and
his
lips
were
smiling
.
though
the
commander
was
occupied
in
giv
ing
instructions
to
major
ekon6mov
he
could
not
help
taking
notice
of
the
soldier
.
your
excellency
here

ddlokhov
pointing
to
the
french
sword
and
pouch
.

d61okhov
breathed
heavily
from
weariness
and
spoke
in
abrupt
sentences
.

replied
the
command

and
turned
to
major
ekon6mov
.
but
d61okhov
did
not
go
away
he
untied
the
handkerchief
around
his
head
pulled
it
off
and
showed
the
blood
congealed
on
his
hair
.
a
bayonet

.
i
remained
at
the
front
.
remember
your
excellency
tushins
battery
had
been
forgotten
and
on
ly
at
the
very
end
of
the
action
did
prince
ba
gration
still
hearing
the
cannonade
in
the
cen
ter
send
his
orderly
staff
officer
and
later
prince
andrew
also
to
order
the
battery
to
re
tire
as
quickly
as
possible
.
when
the
supports
attached
to
tushins
battery
had
been
moved
away
in
the
middle
of
the
action
by
someones
order
the
battery
had
continued
firing
and
was
only
not
captured
by
the
french
because
the
enemy
could
not
surmise
that
anyone
could
have
the
effrontery
to
continue
firing
from
four
quite
undefended
guns
.
on
the
contrary
the
energetic
action
of
that
battery
led
the
french
to
suppose
that
here
in
the
center
the
main
russian
forces
were
concentrated
.
twice
they
had
attempted
to
attack
this
point
but
on
each
occastion
had
been
driven
back
by
grapeshot
from
the
four
isolated
guns
on
the
hillock
.
soon
after
prince
bagrati6n
had
left
him
tushin
had
succeeded
in
setting
fire
to
schon

grand
the
fire
fanned
by
the
breeze
was
rapidly
spreading
.
the
french
columns
that
had
advanced
beyond
the
village
went
back
but
as
though
in
revenge
for
this
failure
the
enemy
placed
ten
guns
to
the
right
of
the
village
and
began
firing
them
at
tiishins
bat
tery
.
in
their
childlike
glee
aroused
by
the
fire
and
their
luck
in
successfully
cannonading
the
french
our
artillerymen
only
noticed
this
bat
tery
when
two
balls
and
then
four
more
fell
among
our
guns
one
knocking
over
two
horses
and
another
tearing
off
a
munitionwagon

ers

.
their
spirits
once
roused
were
how
ever
not
diminished
but
only
changed
char
acter
.
the
horses
were
replaced
by
others
from
a
reserve
gun
carriage
the
wounded
were
car
ried
away
and
the
four
guns
were
turned
against
the
tengun
battery
.
tushins
compan
ion
officer
had
been
killed
at
the
beginning
of
the
engagement
and
within
an
hour
seventeen
of
the
forty
men
of
the
guns
crews
had
been
disabled
but
the
artillerymen
were
still
as
merry
and
lively
as
ever
.
twice
they
noticed
the
french
appearing
below
them
and
then
they
fired
grapeshot
at
them
.
little
tushin
moving
feebly
and
awkward
ly
kept
telling
his
orderly
to
refill
my
pipe
for
that
one
and
then
scattering
sparks
from
it
ran
forward
shading
his
eyes
with
his
small
hand
to
look
at
the
french
.
smack

em
lads
he
kept
saying
seizing
the
guns
by
the
wheels
and
working
the
screws
himself
.
amid
the
smoke
deafened
by
the
incessant
reports
which
always
made
him
jump
tushin
not
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
ran
from
gun
to
gun
now
aiming
now
counting
the
charges
now
giving
orders
about
replacing
dead
or
wounded
horses
and
harnessing
fresh
ones
and
shouting
in
his
feeble
voice
so
high
pitched
and
irresolute
.
his
face
grew
more
and
more
animated
.
only
when
a
man
was
killed
or
wounded
did
he
frown
and
turn
away
from
the
sight
shouting
angrily
at
the
men
who
as
is
always
the
case
hesitated
about
lifting
the
injured
or
dead
.
the
soldiers
for
the
most
part
handsome
fellows
and
as
is
always
the
case
in
an
artillery
company
a
head
and
shoulders
taller
and
twice
as
broad
as
their
officer
all
looked
at
their
commander
like
children
in
an
embarrassing
situation
and
the
expression
on
his
face
was
invariably
reflected
on
theirs
.
owing
to
the
terrible
uproar
and
the
neces
sity
for
concentration
and
activity
tushin
did
not
experience
the
slightest
unpleasant
sense
of
fear
and
the
thought
that
he
might
be
killed
or
badly
wounded
never
occurred
to
him
.
on
the
contrary
he
became
more
and
more
elated
.
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
a
very
long
time
ago
almost
a
day
since
he
had
first
seen
the
enemy
and
fired
the
first
shot
and
that
the
corner
of
the
field
he
stood
on
was
wellknown
and
familiar
ground
.
though
he
thought
of
everything
considered
everything
and
did
everything
the
best
of
officers
could
do
in
his
position
he
was
in
a
state
akin
to
feverish
de
lirium
or
drunkenness
.
from
the
deafening
sounds
of
his
own
guns
around
him
the
whistle
and
thud
of
the
io6
war
and
peace
enemys
cannon
balls
from
the
flushed
and
perspiring
faces
of
the
crew
bustling
round
the
guns
from
the
sight
of
the
blood
of
men
and
horses
from
the
little
puffs
of
smoke
on
the
en
emys
side
always
followed
by
a
ball
flying
past
and
striking
the
earth
a
man
a
gun
a
horse
from
the
sight
of
all
these
things
a
fantastic
world
of
his
own
had
taken
possession
of
his
brain
and
at
that
moment
afforded
him
pleas
ure
.
the
enemys
guns
were
in
his
fancy
not
guns
but
pipes
from
which
occasional
puffs
were
blown
by
an
invisible
smoker
.
there

.

.

.
hes
puffing
again
muttered
tushin
to
himself
as
a
small
cloud
rose
from
the
hill
and
was
borne
in
a
streak
to
the
left
by
the
wind
.
now
look
out
for
the
ball

.

.

.
well
throw
it
back
what
do
you
want
your
honor
asked
an
artilleryman
standing
close
by
who
heard
him
muttering
.
nothing

.

.

.
only
a
shell

.

.

.
he
answered
.
come
along
our
matvevna
he
said
to
himself
.
matvdvna

was
the
name
his
fancy
gave
to
the
farthest
gun
of
the
battery
which
was
large
and
of
an
old
pattern
.
the
french
swarm
ing
round
their
guns
seemed
to
him
like
ants
.
in
that
world
the
handsome
drunkard
num
ber
one
of
the
second

crew
was
uncle
tushin
looked
at
him
more
often
than
at
any
one
else
and
took
delight
in
his
every
move
ment
.
the
sound
of
musketry
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
now
diminishing
now
increasing
seemed
like
someones
breathing
.
he
listened
intently
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
these
sounds
.
ah
breathing
again
breathingl
he
mut
tered
to
himself
.
he
imagined
himself
as
an
enormously
tall
powerful
man
who
was
throwing
cannon
balls
at
the
french
with
both
hands
.
now
then
matvvna
dear
old
lady
dont
let
me
downl
he
was
saying
as
he
moved
from
the
gun
when
a
strange
unfamiliar
voice
called
above
his
head
captain
tushin
captain
tushin
turned
round
in
dismay
.
it
was
the
staff
officer
who
had
turned
him
out
of
the
booth
at
grunth
.
he
was
shouting
in
a
gasping
voice
are
you
mad
you
have
twice
been
ordered
to
retreat
and
you

.

.

.
why
are
they
down
on

thought
tu

looking
in
alarm
at

.

.
he
muttered
holding
up
two
fingers
to
his
cap
.
i

.

.

.
but
the
staff
officer
did
not
finish
what
he
1
daughter

wanted
to
say
.
a
cannon
ball
flying
close
to
him
caused
him
to
duck
and
bend
over
his
horse
.
he
paused
and
just
as
he
was
about
to
say
something
more
another
ball
stopped
him
.
he
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
off
.
retire
all
to
retire
he
shouted
from
a
distance
.
the
soldiers
laughed
.
a
moment
later
an
adjutant
arrived
with
the
same
order
.
it
was
prince
andrew
.
the
first
thing
he
saw
on
riding
up
to
the
space
where
tushins
guns
were
stationed
was
an
unharnessed
horse
with
a
broken
leg
that
lay
screaming
piteously
be
side
the
harnessed
horses
.
blood
was
gushing
from
its
leg
as
from
a
spring
.
among
the
lim
bers
lay
several
dead
men
.
one
ball
after
an
other
passed
over
as
he
approached
and
he
felt
a
nervous
shudder
run
down
his
spine
.
but
the
mere
thought
of
being
afraid
roused
him
again
.
i
cannot
be
afraid
thought
he
and
dis
mounted
slowly
among
the
guns
.
he
delivered
the
order
and
did
not
leave
the
battery
.
he
de
cided
to
have
the
guns
removed
from
their
positions
and
withdrawn
in
his
presence
.
to
gether
with
tushin
stepping
across
the
bodies
and
under
a
terrible
fire
from
the
french
he
attended
to
the
removal
of
the
guns
.
a
staff
officer
was
here
a
minute
ago
but
skipped
off
said
an
artilleryman
to
prince
andrew
.
not
like
your
honor
prince
andrew
said
nothing
to
tushin
.
they
were
both
so
busy
as
to
seem
not
to
notice
one
another
.
when
having
limbered
up
the
only
two
cannon
that
remained
uninjured
out
of
the
four
they
began
moving
down
the
hill
one
shattered
gun
and
one
unicorn
were
left
behind
prince
andrew
rode
up
to
tushin
.
well
till
we
meet
again

.

he
said

ing
out
his
hand
to
tushin
.
goodby
my
dear

goodby
my

for
some

reason
tears
suddenly
filled
his
eyes

the
wind
had
fallen
and
black
clouds
merg
ing
with
the
powder

hung
low
over
the
field
of
battle
on
the
horizon
.
it
was
growing
dark
and
the
glow
of
two
conflagrations
was
the
more
conspicuous
.
the
cannonade
was
dy
ing
down
but
the
rattle
of
musketry
behind
and
on
the
right
sounded
oftener
and
nearer
.
as
soon
as
tushin
with
his
guns
continually
driving
round
or
coming
upon

men
was
out

to
how
to
proceed
reprimanding
and
reproach
ing
him
.
tushin
gave
no
orders
and
silently
fearing
to
speak
because
at
every
word
he
felt
ready
to
weep
without
knowing
why
rode
be
hind
on
his
artillery
nag
.
though
the
orders
were
to
abandon
the
wounded
many
of
them
dragged
themselves
after
the
troops
and
begged
for
seats
on
the
gun
carriages
.
the
jaunty
in
fantry
officer
who
just
before
the
battle
had
rushed
out
of
tushins
wattle
shed
was
laid
with
a
bullet
in
his
stomach
on
matvcvnas
carriage
.
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
a
pale
hussar
cadet
supporting
one
hand
with
the
other
came
up
to
tushin
and
asked
for
a
seat
.
captain
for
gods
sake
ive
hurt
my
arm
he
said
timidly
.
for
gods
sake

..
.
i
cant
walk
.
for
gods
sakel
it
was
plain
that
this
cadet
had
already
re
peatedly
asked
for
a
lift
and
been
refused
.
he
asked
in
a
hesitating
piteous
voice
.
tell
them
to
give
me
a
seat
for
gods
sakel
give
him
a
seat
said
tushin
.
lay
a
cloak
for
him
to
sit
on
lad
he
said
addressing
his
favorite
soldier
.
and
where
is
the
wounded
officer
he
has
been
set
down
.
he
died
replied
someone
.
help
him
up
.

dear
fellow
sit

i
spread
out
the

antonov
.
the
cadet
was
rost6v
.
with
one
hand
he
supported
the
other
he
was
pale
and
his
jaw
trembled
shivering
feverishly
.
he
was
placed
on
matvvna
the
gun
from
which
they
had
removed
the
dead
officer
.
the
cloak
they
spread
under
him
was
wet
with
blood
which
stained
his
breeches
and
arm
.
what
are
you
wounded
my
lad
said
tu
shin
approaching
the
gun
on
which
rost6v
sat
.
no
its
a
sprain
.
then
what
is
this
blood
on
the
gun
car
riage
inquired
tushin
.
it
was
the
officer
your
honor
stained
it
answered
the
artilleryman
wiping
away
the
blood
with
his
coat
sleeve
as
if
apologizing
for
the
state
of
his
gun
.
it
was
all
that
they
could
do
to
get
the
guns
up
the
rise
aided
by
the
infantry
and
having
reached
the
village
of
gruntersdorf
they
halted
.
it
had
grown
so
dark
that
one
could
not
dis
tinguish
the
uniforms
ten
paces
off
and
the
firing
had
begun
to
subside
.
suddenly
near
by
on
the
right
shouting
and
firing
were
again
heard
.
flashes
of
shot
gleamed
in
the
darkness
.
this
was
the
last
french
attack
and
was
met
by
soldiers
who
had
sheltered
in
the
village
houses
.
they
all
rushed
out
of
the
village
again
but
tushins
guns
could
not
move
and
the
artil
lerymen
tushin
and
the
cadet
exchanged
si
lent
glances
as
they
awaited
their
fate
.
the
fir
ing
died
down
and
soldiers
talking
eagerly
streamed
out
of
a
side
street
.
not
hurt
pctr6v
asked
one
.
weve
given

em

they
wont
make

now
said
another
.
you
couldnt
see
a
thing
.
how
they
shot
at
their
own
fellows
nothing
could
be
seen
.
pitchdark
brother
isnt
there
something
to
drink
the
french
had
been
repulsed
for
the
last
time
.
and
again
and
again
in
the
complete
darkness
tushins
guns
moved
forward
sur
rounded
by
the
humming
infantry
as
by
a
frame
.
in
the
darkness
it
seemed
as
though
a
gloomy
unseen
river
was
flowing
always
in
one
direc
tion
humming
with
whispers
and
talk
and
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
wheels
.
amid
the
general
rumble
the
groans
and
voices
of
the
wounded
were
more
distinctly
heard
than
any
other
sound
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
.
the
gloom
that
enveloped
the
army
was
filled
with
their
groans
which
seemed
to
melt
into
one
with
the
darkness
of
the
night
.
after
a
while
the
mov
ing
mass
became
agitated
someone
rode
past
on
a
white
horse
followed
by
his
suite
and
said
something
in
passing
what
did
he
say
where
to
now
halt
is
it
did
he
thank
us
came
eager
questions
from
all
sides
.
the
whole
moving
mass
began
pressing
closer
together
and
a
report
spread
that
they
were
ordered
to
halt
evidently
those
in
front
had
halted
.
all
remained
where
they
were
in
the
middle
of
the
muddy
road
.
fires
were
lighted
and
the
talk
became
more
audible
.
captain
tushin
having
given
orders
to
his
company
sent
a
soldier
to
find
a
dressing
station
or
a
doctor
for
the
cadet
and
sat
down
by
a
bonfire
the
soldiers
had
kindled
on
the
road
.
rost6v
too
dragged
himself
to
the
fire
.
from
pain
cold
and
damp
a
feverish
shiver
ing
shook
his
whole
body
.
drowsiness
was
ir
resistibly
mastering
him
but
he
was
keptawake
by
an
excruciating
pain
in
his
arm
for
which
he
could
find
no
satisfactory
position
.
he
kept
closing
his
eyes
and
then
again
looking
at
the
fire
which
seemed
to
him
dazzlingly
red
and
at
the
feeble
roundshouldered
figure
of
tu
shin
who
was
sitting
crosslegged
like
a
turk
io8
war
and
peace
beside
him
.
ttishins
large
kind
intelligent
eyes
were
fixed
with
sympathy
and
commisera
tion
on
rost6v
who
saw
that
tushin
with
his
whole
heart
wished
to
help
him
but
could
not
.
from
all
sides
were
heard
the
footsteps
and
talk
of
the
infantry
who
were
walking
driv
ing
past
and
settling
down
all
around
.
the
sound
of
voices
the
tramping
feet
the
horses
hoofs
moving
in
mud
the
crackling
of
wood
fires
near
and
afar
merged
into
one
tremu
lous
rumble
.
it
was
no
longer
as
before
a
dark
unseen
river
flowing
through
the
gloom
but
a
dark
sea
swelling
and
gradually
subsiding
after
a
storm
.
rost6v
looked
at
and
listened
listlessly
to
what
passed
before
and
around
him
.
an
in
fantryman
came
to
the
fire
squatted
on
his
heels
held
his
hands
to
the
blaze
and
turned
away
his
face
.
you
dont
mind
your
honor
he
asked
tu
shin
.
ive
lost
my
company
your
honor
.
i
dont
know
where

.

.

.
such
bad
luck
with
the
soldier
an
infantry
officer
with
a
bandaged
cheek
came
up
to
the
bonfire
and
addressing
tushin
asked
him
to
have
the
guns
moved
a
trifle
to
let
a
wagon
go
past
.
after
he
had
gone
two
soldiers
rushed
to
the
campfire
.
they
were
quarreling
and
fighting
desperately
each
trying
to
snatch
from
the
other
a
boot
they
were
both
holding
on
to
.
you
picked
it
up

..
.
i
dare
say
youre
very
smart
one
of
them
shouted
hoarsely
.
then
a
thin
pale
soldier
his
neck
band
aged
with
a
bloodstained
leg
band
came
up
and
in
angry
tones
asked
the
artillerymen
for
water
.
must
one
die
like
a
dog
said
he
.
tushin
told
them
to
give
the
man
some
wa
ter
.
then
a
cheerful
soldier
ran
up
begging
a
little
fire
for
the
infantry
.
a
nice
little
hot
torch
for
the
infantry
good
luck
to
you
fellow
countrymen
.
thanks
for
the
firewell
return
it
with
interest
said
he
carrying
away
into
the
darkness
a
glowing
stick
.
next
came
four
soldiers
carrying
something
heavy
on
a
cloak
and
passed
by
the
fire
.
one
of
them
stumbled
.
who
the
devil
has
put
the
logs
on
the
road
snarled
he
.
hes
deadwhy
carry
him
said
another
.
shut
up
and
they
disappeared
into
the
darkness
with
their
load
.
still
aching
tiishin
asked
rost6v
in
a
whisper
.
yes
.
your
honor
youre
wanted
by
the
general
.
he
is
in
the
hut
here
said
a
gunner
coming
up
to
tushin
.
coming
friend
.
tushin
rose
and
buttoning
his
greatcoat
and
pulling
it
straight
walked
away
from
the
fire
.
not
far
from
the
artillery
campfire
in
a
hut
that
had
been
prepared
for
him
prince
bagra
ti6n
sat
at
dinner
talkingwith
some
command
ing
officers
who
had
gathered
at
his
quarters
.
the
little
old
man
with
the
halfclosed
eyes
was
there
greedily
gnawing
a
mutton
bone
and
the
general
who
had
served
blamelessly
for
twenty
two
years
flushed
by
a
glass
of
vodka
and
the
dinner
and
the
staff
officer
with
the
signet
ring
and
zhcrk6v
uneasily
glancing
at
them
all
and
prince
andrew
pale
with
com
pressed
lips
and
feverishly
glittering
eyes
.
in
a
corner
of
the
hut
stood
a
standard
cap
tured
from
the
french
and
theaccountantwith
the
naive
face
was
feeling
its
texture
shaking
his
head
in
perplexity
perhaps
because
the
banner
really
interested
him
perhaps
because
it
was
hard
for
him
hungry
as
he
was
to
look
on
at
a
dinner
where
there
was
no
place
for
him
.
in
the
next
hut
there
was
a
french
colonel
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
our
dragoons
.
our
officers
were
flocking
in
to
look
at
him
.
prince
bagrati6n
was
thanking
the
individual
commanders
and
inquiring
into
details
of
the
action
and
our
losses
.
the
general
whose
regi
ment
had
been
inspected
at
braunau
was
in
forming
the
prince
that
as
soon
as
the
action
began
he
had
withdrawn
from
the
wood
mus
tered
the
men
who
were
woodcutting
and
al
lowing
the
french
to
pass
him
had
made
a
bayonet
charge
with
two
battalions
and
had
broken
up
the
french
troops
.
when
i
saw
your
excellency
that
their
first
battalion
was
disorganized
i
stopped
in
the
road
and
thought
ill
let
them
come
on
and
will
meet
them
with
the
fire
of
the
whole
bat
talion
and
thats
what
i
did
.
the
general
had
so
wished
to
do
this
and
was
so
sorry
he
had
not
managed
to
do
it
that
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
it
had
really
happened
.
perhaps
it
might
really
have
been
so
could
one
possibly
make
out
amid
all
that
confusion
what
did
or
did
not
happen
by
the
way
your
excellency
i
should
inform
you
he
continued
remembering
d61okhovs
conversation
with
kutuzov
and
his
last
inter
view
with
the
gentlemanranker
that
private
d61okhov
who
was
reduced
to
the
ranks
took
book
a
french
officer
prisoner
in
my
presence
and
particularly
distinguished
himself
i
saw
the
pdvlograd
hussars
attack
there
your
excellency
chimed
in
zherk6v
looking
uneasily
around
.
he
had
not
seen
the
hussars
all
that
day
but
had
heard
about
them
from
an
infantry
officer
.
they
broke
up
two
squares
your
excellency
several
of
those
present
smiled
at
zherk6vs
words
expecting
one
of
his
usual
jokes
but
noticing
that
what
he
was
saying
redounded
to
the
glory
of
our
arms
and
of
the
days
work
they
assumed
a
serious
expression
though
many
of
them
knew
that
what
he
was
saying
was
a
lie
devoid
of
any
foundation
.
prince
ba
grati6n
turned
to
the
old
colonel
gentlemen
i
thank
you
all
all
arms
have
behaved
heroically
infantry
cavalry
and
ar
tillery
.
how
was
it
that
two
guns
were
aban
doned
in
the
center
he
inquired
searching
with
his
eyes
for
someone
.
prince
bagrati6n
did
not
ask
about
the
guns
on
the
left
flank
he
knew
that
all
the
guns
there
had
been
aban
doned
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
action
.
i
think
i
sent
you
he
added
turning
to
the
staff
officer
on
duty
.
one
was
damaged
answered
the
staff
offi
cer
and
the
other
i
cant
understand
.
i
was
there
all
the
time
giving
orders
and
had
only
just
left
it
is
true
that
it
was
hot
there
he
added
modestly
.
someone
mentioned
that
captain
tushin
was
bivouacking
close
to
the
village
and
had
al
ready
been
sent
for
.
oh
but
you
were
there
said
prince
bagra
tion
addressing
prince
andrew
.
of
course
weonly
just
missed
one
another
said
the
staff
officer
with
a
smile
to
bolk6nski
.
i
had
not
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
said
prince
andrew
coldly
and
abruptly
.
all
were
silent
.
tushin
appeared
at
the
threshold
and
made
his
way
timidly
from
be
hind
the
backs
of
the
generals
.
as
he
stepped
past
the
generals
in
the
crowded
hut
feeling
embarrassed
as
he
always
was
by
the
sight
of
his
superiors
he
did
not
notice
the
staff
of
the
banner
and
stumbled
over
it
.
several
of
those
present
laughed
.
how
was
it
a
gun
was
abandoned
asked
bagrati6n
frowning
not
so
much
at
the
cap
tain
as
at
those
who
were
laughing
among
whom
zherk6v
laughed
loudest
.
only
now
when
he
was
confronted
by
the
stern
authorities
did
his
guilt
and
the
disgrace
of
having
lost
two
guns
and
yet
remaining
alive
present
themselves
to
tushin
in
all
their
hor
two
109
ror
.
he
had
been
so
excited
that
he
had
not
thought
about
it
until
that
moment
.
the
offi
cers
laughter
confused
himstill
more
.
hestood
before
bagrati6n
with
his
lower
jaw
trembling
and
was
hardly
able
to
mutter
i
dont
know

.

.

.
your
excellency

..
.
i
had
no
men

.

.

.
your
excellency
.
you
might
have
taken
some
from
the
cov
ering
troops
.
tushin
did
not
say
that
there
were
no
cov
ering
troops
though
that
was
perfectly
true
.
he
was
afraid
of
getting
some
other
officer
in
to
trouble
and
silently
fixed
his
eyes
on
ba
grati6n
as
a
schoolboy
who
has
blundered
looks
at
an
examiner
.
the
silence
lasted
some
time
.
prince
bagra
ti6n
apparently
not
wishing
to
be
severe
found
nothing
to
say
the
others
did
not
venture
to
intervene
.
prince
andrew
looked
at
tushin
from
under
his
brows
and
his
fingers
twitched
nervously
.
your
excellency
prince
andrew
broke
the
silence
with
his
abrupt
voice
you
were
pleased
to
send
me
to
captain
tiishins
battery
.
i
went
there
and
found
two
thirds
of
the
men
and
horses
knocked
out
two
guns
smashed
and
no
supports
at
all
.
prince
bagrati6n
and
tushin
looked
with
equal
intentness
at
bolk6nski
who
spoke
with
suppressed
agitation
.
and
if
your
excellency
will
allow
me
to
express
my
opinion
he
continued
we
owe
todays
success
chiefly
to
the
action
of
that
bat
tery
and
the
heroic
endurance
of
captain
tu
shin
and
his
company
and
without
awaiting
a
reply
prince
andrew
rose
and
left
the
table
.
prince
bagrati6n
looked
at
tushin
evident
ly
reluctant
to
show
distrust
in
bolk6nskis
em
phatic
opinion
yet
not
feeling
able
fully
to
credit
it
bent
his
head
and
told
tushin
that
he
could
go
.
prince
andrew
went
out
with
him
.
thank
you
you
saved
me
my
dear
fellowl
said
tushin
.
prince
andrew
gave
him
a
look
but
said
nothing
and
went
away
.
he
felt
sad
and
de
pressed
.
it
was
all
so
strange
so
unlike
what
he
had
hoped
.
who
are
they
why
are
they
here
what
do
they
want
and
when
will
all
this
end
thought
rostcw
looking
at
the
changing
shad
ows
before
him
.
the
pain
in
his
arm
became
more
and
more
intense
.
irresistible
drowsiness
overpowered
him
red
rings
danced
before
his
eyes
and
the
impression
of
those
voices
and
faces
and
a
sense
of
loneliness
merged
with
the
no
physical
pain
.
it
was
they
these
soldiers
wounded
and
unwounded
it
was
they
who
were
crushing
weighing
down
and
twisting
the
sinews
and
scorching
the
flesh
of
his
sprained
arm
and
shoulder
.
to
rid
himself
of
them
he
closed
his
eyes
.
for
a
moment
he
dozed
but
in
that
short
in
terval
innumerable
things
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
his
mother
and
her
large
white

that

was
the

thing
as
this

with
the

and
it
was
that
affair
and
this
soldier
that
were
so
agoniz
ingly
incessantly
pulling
and
pressing
his
arm
and
always
dragging
it
in

he
tried
to

they

for

opened

he
was
alone
now
except
for
a
soldier
who
was
sitting
naked
at
the
other
side
of
the
fire
warm
ing
his

he
looked
at

remembered
a

at

his

his

all

prince
vasli
was
not
a
man
who
deliberately
thought
out
his
plans
.
still
less
did
he
think
of
injuring
anyone
for
his
own
advantage
.
he
was
merely
a
man
of
the
world
who
had
got
on
and
to
whom
getting
on
had
become
a
habit
.
schemes
and
devices
for
which
he
never
right
ly
accounted
to
himself
but
which
formed
the
whole
interest
of
his
life
were
constantly
shap
ing
themselves
in
his
mind
arising
from
the
circumstances
and
persons
he
met
.
of
these
plans
he
had
not
merely
one
or
two
in
his
head
but
dozens
some
only
beginning
to
form
themselves
some
approaching
achievement
and
some
in
course
of
disintegration
.
he
did
not
for
instance
say
to
himself
this
man
now
has
influence
i
must
gain
his
confidence
and
friendship
and
through
him
obtain
a
spe
cial
grant
nor
did
he
say
to
himself
pierre
is
a
rich
man
i
must
entice
him
to
marry
my
daughter
and
lend
me
the
forty
thousand
ru
bles
i
need
.
but
when
he
came
across
a
man
of
position
his
instinct
immediately
told
him
that
this
man
could
be
useful
and
without
any
pre
meditation
prince
vasili
took
the
first
oppor
tunity
to
gain
his
confidence
flatter
him
be
come
intimate
with
him
and
finally
make
his
request
.
he
had
pierre
at
hand
in
moscow
and
pro
cured
for
him
an
appointment
as
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
which
at
that
time
con
ferred
the
status
of
councilor
of
state
and
insisted
on
the
young
man
accompanying
him
to
petersburg
and
staying
at
his
house
.
with
apparent
absentmindedness
yet
with
unhesitating
assurance
that
he
was
doing
the
right
thing
prince
vasili
did
everything
to
get
pierre
to
marry
his
daughter
.
had
he
thought
out
his
plans
beforehand
he
could
not
have
been
so
natural
and
shown
such
un
affected
familiarity
in
intercourse
with
every
body
both
above
and
below
him
in
social
standing
.
something
always
drew
him
toward
those
richer
and
more
powerful
than
himself
and
he
had
rare
skill
in
seizing
the
most
op
portune
moment
for
making
use
of
people
.
pierre
on
unexpectedly
becoming
count
be
ziikhov
and
a
rich
man
felt
himself
after
his
recent
loneliness
and
freedom
from
cares
so
be
set
and
preoccupied
that
only
in
bed
was
he
able
to
be
by
himself
.
he
had
to
sign
papers
to
present
himself
at
government
offices
the
pur
pose
of
which
was
not
clear
to
him
to
question
his
chief
steward
to
visit
his
estate
near
mos
cow
and
to
receive
many
people
who
formerly
did
not
even
wish
to
know
of
his
existence
but
would
now
have
been
offended
and
grieved
had
he
chosen
not
to
see
them
.
these
differ
ent
people
businessmen
relations
and
ac
quaintances
alike
were
all
disposed
to
treat
the
young
heir
in
the
most
friendly
and
flatter
ing
manner
they
were
all
evidently
firmly
con
vinced
of
pierres
noble
qualities
.
he
was
always
hearing
such
words
as
with
your
re
markable
kindness
or
with
your
excellent
heart
you
are
yourself
so
honorable
count
or
were
he
as
clever
as
you
and
so
on
till
he
began
sincerely
to
believe
in
his
own
excep
tional
kindness
and
extraordinary
intelligence
the
more
so
as
in
the
depth
of
his
heart
it
had
always
seemed
to
him
that
he
really
was
very
kind
and
intelligent
.
even
people
who
had
formerly
been
spiteful
toward
him
and
evident
ly
unfriendly
now
became
gentle
and
affection
ate
.
the
angry
eldest
princess
with
the
long
waist
and
hair
plastered
down
like
a
dolls
had
come
into
pierres
room
after
the
funeral
.
with
drooping
eyes
and
frequent
blushes
she
told
him
she
was
very
sorry
about
their
past
misun
derstandings
and
did
not
now
feel
she
had
a
right
to
ask
him
for
anything
except
only
for
permission
after
the
blow
she
had
received
to
remain
for
a
few
weeks
longer
in
the
house
she
so
loved
and
where
she
had
sacrificed
so
much
.
she
could
not
refrain
from
weeping
at
these
words
.
touched
that
this
statuesque
princess
could
so
change
pierre
took
her
hand
and
begged
her
forgiveness
without
knowing
what
for
.
from
that
day
the
eldest
princess
quite
changed
toward
pierre
and
war
and
peace
began
knitting
a
striped
scarf
for
him
.
do
this
for
my
sake
mon
cher
after
all
she
had
to
put
up
with
a
great
deal
from
the
de
ceased
said
prince
vasfli
to
him
handing
him
a
deed
to
sign
for
the
princess
benefit
.
prince
vaslli
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
necessary
to
throw
this
bone
a
bill
for
thirty
thousand
rubles
to
the
poor
prin
cess
that
it
might
not
occur
to
her
to
speak
of
his
share
in
the
affair
of
the
inlaid
portfolio
.
pierre
signed
the
deed
and
after
that
the
prin
cess
grew
still
kinder
.
the
younger
sisters
also
became
affectionate
to
him
especially
the
youngest
the
pretty
one
with
the
mole
who
often
made
him
feel
confused
by
her
smiles
and
her
own
confusion
when
meeting
him
.
it
seemed
so
natural
to
pierre
that
everyone
should
like
him
and
it
would
have
seemed
so
unnatural
had
anyone
disliked
him
that
he
could
not
but
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
those
around
him
.
besides
he
had
no
time
to
ask
himself
whether
these
people
were
sincere
or
not
.
he
was
always
busy
and
always
felt
in
a
state
of
mild
and
cheerful
intoxication
.
he
felt
as
though
he
were
the
center
of
some
im
portant
and
general
movement
that
something
was
constantly
expected
of
him
that
if
he
did
not
do
it
he
would
grieve
and
disappoint
many
people
but
if
he
did
this
and
that
all
would
bewell
and
he
did
what
was
demanded
of
him
but
still
that
happy
result
always
remained
in
the
future
.
more
than
anyone
else
prince
vasfli
took
possession
of
pierres
affairs
and
of
pierre
him
self
in
those
early
days
.
from
the
death
of
count
bezukhov
he
did
not
let
go
his
hold
of
the
lad
.
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
oppressed
by
business
weary
and
suffering
who
yet
would
not
for
pitys
sake
leave
this
helpless
youth
who
after
all
was
the
son
of
his
old
friend
and
the
possessor
of
such
enormous
wealth
to
the
caprice
of
fate
and
the
designs
of
rogues
.
dur
ing
the
few
days
he
spent
in
moscow
after
the
death
of
count
bezukhov
he
would
call
pierre
or
go
to
him
himself
and
tell
him
what
ought
to
be
done
in
a
tone
of
weariness
and
assurance
as
if
he
were
adding
every
time
you
know
i
am
overwhelmed
with
business
and
it
is
purely
out
of
charity
that
i
trouble
myself
about
you
and
you
also
know
quite
well
that
what
i
pro
pose
is
the
only
thing
possible
.
well
my
dear
fellow
tomorrow
we
are
off
at
last
said
prince
vasfli
one
day
closing
his
eyes
and
fingering
pierres
elbow
speaking
as
if
he
were
saying
something
which
had
long
since
been
agreed
upon
and
could
not
now
be
altered
.
we
start
tomorrow
and
im
giving
you
a
place
in
my
carriage
.
i
am
very
glad
.
all
our
important
business
here
is
now
settled
and
i
ought
to
have
been
off
long
ago
.
here
is
some
thing
i
have
received
from
the
chancellor
.
i
asked
him
for
you
and
you
have
been
entered
in
the
diplomatic
corps
and
made
a
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
.
the
diplomatic
career
now
lies
open
before
you
.
notwithstanding
the
tone
of
wearied
assur
ance
with
which
these
words
were
pronounced
pierre
who
had
so
long
been
considering
his
career
wished
to
make
some
suggestion
.
but
prince
vasili
interrupted
him
in
the
special
deep
cooing
tone
precluding
the
possibility
of
interrupting
his
speech
which
he
used
in
ex
treme
cases
when
special
persuasion
was
need
ed
.
mais
mon
cher
i
did
this
for
my
own
sake
to
satisfy
my
conscience
and
there
is
nothing
to
thank
me
for
.
no
one
has
ever
complained
yet
of
being
too
much
loved
and
besides
you
are
free
you
could
throw
it
up
tomorrow
.
but
you
will
see
everything
for
yourself
when
you
get
to
petersburg
.
it
is
high
time
for
you
to
get
away
from
these
terrible
recollections
.
prince
vasfli
sighed
.
yes
yes
my
boy
.
and
my
valet
can
go
in
your
carriage
.
ah
i
was
nearly
for
getting
he
added
.
you
know
mon
cheryour
father
and
i
had
some
accounts
to
settle
so
i
have
received
what
was
due
from
the
ryazan
estate
and
will
keep
it
you
wont
require
it
.
well
go
into
the
accounts
later
.
by
what
was
due
from
the
ryazan
estate
prince
vasfli
meant
several
thousand
rubles
quitrent
received
from
pierres
peasants
which
the
prince
had
retained
for
himself
.
in
petersburg
as
in
moscow
pierre
found
the
same
atmosphere
of
gentleness
and
affec
tion
.
he
could
not
refuse
the
post
or
rather
the
rank
for
he
did
nothing
that
prince
va
sfli
had
procured
for
him
and
acquaintances
invitations
and
social
occupations
were
so
num
erous
that
even
more
than
in
moscow
he
felt
a
sense
of
bewilderment
bustle
and
continual
expectation
of
some
good
always
in
front
of
him
but
never
attained
.
of
his
former
bachelor
acquaintances
many
were
no
longer
in
petersburg
the
guards
had
gone
to
the
front
d61okhov
had
been
reduced
to
the
ranks
anatole
was
in
the
army
some
where
in
the
provinces
prince
andrew
was
abroad
so
pierre
had
not
the
opportunity
to
spend
his
nights
as
he
used
to
like
to
spend
them
or
to
open
his
mind
by
intimate
talks
with
a
friend
older
than
himself
and
whom
he
book
respected
.
his
whole
time
was
taken
up
with
dinners
and
balls
and
was
spent
chiefly
at
prince
vasilis
house
in
the
company
of
the
stout
princess
his
wife
and
his
beautiful
daugh
ter
hdene
.
like
the
others
anna
pdvlovna
schrer
showed
pierre
the
change
of
attitude
toward
him
that
had
taken
place
in
society
.
formerly
in
anna
pdvlovnas
presence
pierre
had
always
felt
that
what
he
was
say
ing
was
out
of
place
tactless
and
unsuitable
that
remarks
which
seemed
to
him
clever
while
they
formed
in
his
mind
became
foolish
as
soon
as
he
uttered
them
while
on
the
contrary
hippolytes
stupidest
remarks
came
out
clev
er
and
apt
.
now
everything
pierre
said
was
charmant
.
even
if
anna
pavlovna
did
not
say
so
he
could
see
that
she
wished
to
and
only
refrained
out
of
regard
for
his
modesty
.
in
the
beginning
of
the
winter
of
18056
pierre
received
one
of
anna
pavlovnas
usual
pink
notes
with
an
invitation
to
which
was
added
you
will
find
the
beautiful
hdlcne
here
whom
it
is
always
delightful
to
see
.
when
he
read
that
sentence
pierre
felt
for
the
first
time
that
some
link
which
other
peo
ple
recognized
had
grown
up
between
himself
and
hlne
and
that
thought
both
alarmed
him
as
if
some
obligation
were
being
imposed
on
him
which
he
could
not
fulfill
and
pleased
him
as
an
entertaining
supposition
.
anna
pdvlovnas
at
home
was
like
the
for
mer
one
only
the
novelty
she
offered
her
guests
this
time
was
not
mortemart
but
a
diploma
tist
fresh
from
berlin
with
the
very
latest
details
of
the
emperor
alexanders
visit
to
potsdam
and
of
how
the
two
august
friends
had
pledged
themselves
in
an
indissoluble
alliance
to
up
hold
the
cause
of
justice
against
the
enemy
of
the
human
race
.
anna
pdvlovna
received
pierre
with
a
shade
of
melancholy
evidently
relating
to
the
young
mans
recent
loss
by
the
death
of
count
bezukhov
everyone
constant
ly
considered
it
a
duty
to
assure
pierre
that
he
was
greatly
afflicted
by
the
death
of
the
father
he
had
hardly
known
and
her
melancholy
was
just
like
the
august
melancholy
she
showed
at
the
mention
of
her
most
august
majesty
the
empress
mdryafedorovna
.
pierre
felt
flattered
by
this
.
anna
pdvlovna
arranged
the
different
groups
in
her
drawing
room
with
her
habitual
skill
.
the
large
group
in
which
were
prince
vasili
and
the
generals
had
the
benefit
of
the
diplomat
.
another
group
was
at
the
tea
table
.
pierre
wished
to
join
the
former
but
anna
pv
lovna
who
was
in
the
excited
condition
of
a
three
113
commander
on
a
battlefield
to
whom
thousands
of
new
and
brilliant
ideas
occur
which
there
is
hardly
time
to
put
in
action
seeing
pierre
touched
his
sleeve
with
her
finger
saying
wait
a
bit
i
have
something
in
view
for
you
this
evening
.
she
glanced
at
hdene
and
smiled
at
her
.
my
dear
hlne
be
charitable
to
my
poor
aunt
who
adores
you
.
go
and
keep
her
company
for
ten
minutes
.
and
that
it
will
not
be
too
dull
here
is
the
dear
count
who
will
not
refuse
to
accompany
you
.
the
beauty
went
to
the
aunt
but
anna
pav
lovna
detained
pierre
looking
as
if
she
had
to
give
some
final
necessary
instructions
.
isnt
she
exquisite
she
said
to
pierre
pointing
to
the
stately
beauty
as
she
glided
a
way
.and
how
she
carries
herself
forso
young
a
girl
such
tact
such
masterly
perfection
of
manner
it
comes
from
her
heart
.
happy
the
man
who
wins
her
with
her
the
least
worldly
of
men
would
occupy
a
most
brilliant
position
in
society
.
dont
you
think
so
i
only
wanted
to
know
your
opinion
and
anna
pdvlovna
let
pierre
go
.
pierre
in
reply
sincerely
agreed
with
her
as
to
helenes
perfection
of
manner
.
if
he
ever
thought
of
hhneitwas
just
of
her
beauty
and
her
remarkable
skill
in
appearing
silently
dig
nified
in
society
.
the
old
aunt
received
the
two
young
people
in
her
corner
but
seemed
desirous
of
hiding
her
adoration
for
hdlene
and
inclined
rather
to
show
her
fear
of
anna
pdvlovna
.
she
looked
at
her
niece
as
if
inquiring
what
she
was
to
do
with
these
people
.
on
leaving
them
anna
pdv
lovna
again
touched
pierres
sleeve
saying
i
hope
you
wont
say
that
it
is
dull
in
my
house
again
and
she
glanced
at
heuene
.
hlene
smiled
with
a
look
implying
that
she
did
not
admit
the
possibility
of
anyone
see
ing
her
without
being
enchanted
.
the
aunt
coughed
swallowed
and
said
in
french
that
she
was
very
pleased
to
see
hlne
then
she
turned
to
pierre
with
the
same
words
of
wel
come
and
the
same
look
.
in
the
middle
of
a
dull
and
halting
conversation
hlene
turned
to
pierre
with
the
beautiful
bright
smile
that
she
gave
to
everyone
.
pierre
was
so
used
to
that
smile
and
it
had
so
little
meaning
for
him
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
it
.
the
aunt
was
just
speaking
of
a
collection
of
snuffboxes
that
had
belonged
to
pierres
father
count
be
ziikhov
and
showed
them
her
own
box
.
prin
cess
hdene
asked
to
see
the
portrait
of
the
aunts
husband
on
the
box
lid
.
that
is
probably
the
work
of
vinesse
said
war
and
peace
pierre
mentioning
a
celebrated
miniaturist
and
he
leaned
over
the
table
to
take
the
snuff
box
while
trying
to
hear
what
was
being
said
at
the
other
table
.
he
half
rose
meaning
to
go
round
but
the
aunt
handed
him
the
snuff
box
passing
it
across
hlnes
back
.
hlene
stooped
forward
to
make
room
and
looked
round
with
a
smile
.
she
was
as
always
at
evening
parties
wearing
a
dress
such
as
was
then
fashionable
cut
very
low
at
front
and
back
.
her
bust
which
had
always
seemed
like
marble
to
pierre
was
so
close
to
him
that
his
shortsighted
eyes
could
not
but
perceive
the
living
charm
of
her
neck
and
shoul
ders
so
near
to
his
lips
that
he
need
only
have
bent
his
head
a
little
to
have
touched
them
.
he
was
conscious
of
the
warmth
of
her
body
the
scent
of
perfume
and
the
creaking
of
her
cor
set
as
she
moved
.
he
did
not
see
her
marble
beauty
forming
a
complete
whole
with
her
dress
but
all
the
charm
of
her
body
only
covered
by
her
garments
.
and
having
once
seen
this
he
could
not
help
being
aware
of
it
just
as
we
can
not
renew
an
illusion
we
have
once
seen
through
.
so
you
have
never
noticed
before
how
beau
tiful
i
am
hlene
seemed
to
say
.
you
had
not
noticed
that
i
am
a
woman
yes
i
am
a
wom
an
who
may
belong
to
anyone
to
you
too
said
her
glance
.
and
at
that
moment
pierre
felt
that
hdene
not
only
could
but
must
be
his
wife
and
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise
.
he
knew
this
at
that
moment
as
surely
as
if
he
had
been
standing
at
the
altar
with
her
.
how
and
when
this
would
be
he
did
not
know
he
did
not
even
know
if
it
would
be
a
good
thing
he
even
felt
he
knew
not
why
that
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
but
he
knew
it
would
happen
.
pierre
dropped
his
eyes
lifted
them
again
and
wished
once
more
to
see
her
as
a
distant
beauty
far
removed
from
him
as
he
had
seen
her
every
day
.until
then
but
he
could
no
long
er
do
it
.
he
could
not
any
more
than
a
man
who
has
been
looking
at
a
tuft
of
steppe
grass
through
the
mist
and
taking
it
for
a
tree
can
again
take
it
for
a
tree
after
he
has
once
recog
nized
it
to
be
a
tuft
of
grass
.
she
was
terribly
close
to
him
.
she
already
had
power
over
him
and
between
them
there
was
no
longer
any
barrier
except
the
barrier
of
his
own
will
.
well
i
will
leave
you
in
your
little
corner
came
anna
pdvlovnas
voice
i
see
you
are
all
right
there
.
and
pierre
anxiously
trying
to
remember
whether
he
had
done
anything
reprehensible
looked
round
with
a
blush
.
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
knew
what
had
happened
to
him
as
he
knew
it
himself
.
a
little
later
when
he
went
up
to
the
large
circle
anna
pdvlovna
said
to
him
i
hear
you
are
refitting
your
petersburg
house
this
was
true
.
the
architect
had
told
him
that
it
was
necessary
and
pierre
without
know
ing
why
was
having
his
enormous
petersburg
house
done
up
.
thats
a
good
thing
but
dont
move
from
prince
vasflis
.
it
is
good
to
have
a
friend
like
the
prince
she
said
smiling
at
prince
vastti
.
i
know
something
about
that
.
dont
i
and
you
are
still
so
young
.
you
need
advice
.
dont
be
angry
with
me
for
exercising
an
old
womans
privilege
.
she
paused
as
women
always
do
expecting
something
after
they
have
mentioned
their
age
.
if
you
marry
it
will
be
a
different
thing
she
continued
uniting
them
both
in
one
glance
.
pierre
did
not
look
at
hdlene
nor
she
at
him
.
but
she
was
just
as
terribly
close
to
him
.
he
muttered
something
and
colored
.
when
he
got
home
he
could
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
for
thinking
of
what
had
happened
.
what
had
happened
nothing
.
he
had
merely
understood
that
the
woman
he
had
known
as
a
child
of
whom
when
her
beauty
was
mentioned
he
had
said
absentmindedly
yes
shes
good
looking
he
had
understood
that
this
woman
might
belong
to
him
.
but
shes
stupid
.
i
have
myself
said
she
is
stupid
he
thought
.
there
is
something
nas
ty
something
wrong
in
the
feeling
she
excites
in
me
.
i
have
been
told
that
her
brother
ana
tole
was
in
love
with
her
and
she
with
him
that
there
was
quite
a
scandal
and
that
thats
why
he
was
sent
away
.
hippolyte
is
her
brother

.

.

.
prince
vastti
is
her
father

.

.

.
its
bad

he
reflected
but
while
he
was
think
ing
this
the
reflection
was
still
incomplete
he
caught
himself
smiling
and
was
conscious
that
another
line
of
thought
had
sprung
up
and
while
thinking
of
her
worthlessness
he
was
also
dreaming
of
how
she
would
be
his
wife
how
she
would
love
him
and
become
quite
different
and
how
all
he
had
thought
and
heard
of
her
might
be
false
.
and
he
again
saw
her
not
as
the
daughter
of
prince
vasfli
but
visualized
her
whole
body
only
veiled
by
its
gray
dress
.
but
no
i
why
did
this
thought
never
occur
to
me
before
and
again
he
told
himself
that
it
was
impossible
that
there
would
be
something
un
natural
and
as
it
seemed
to
him
dishonorable
in
this
marriage
.
he
recalled
her
former
words
book
three
and
looks
and
the
words
and
looks
of
those
who
had
seen
them
together
.
he
recalled
anna
pdv
lovnas
words
and
looks
when
she
spoke
to
him
about
his
house
recalled
thousands
of
such
hints
from
prince
vasili
and
others
and
was
seized
by
terror
lest
he
had
already
in
some
way
bound
himself
to
do
something
that
was
evidently
wrong
and
that
he
ought
not
to
do
.
but
at
the
very
time
he
was
expressing
this
con
viction
to
himself
in
another
part
of
his
mind
her
image
rose
in
all
its
womanly
beauty
.
chapter
ii
in
november
1805
prince
vasfli
had
to
go
on
a
tour
of
inspection
in
four
different
provinces
.
he
had
arranged
this
for
himself
so
as
to
visit
his
neglected
estates
at
the
same
time
and
pick
up
his
son
anatole
where
his
regiment
was
sta
tioned
and
take
him
to
visit
prince
nicholas
bolk6nski
in
order
to
arrange
a
match
for
him
with
the
daughter
of
that
rich
old
man
.
but
be
fore
leaving
home
and
undertaking
these
new
affairs
prince
vasili
had
to
settle
matters
with
pierre
who
it
is
true
had
latterly
spent
whole
days
at
home
that
is
in
prince
vasflis
house
where
he
was
staying
and
had
been
absurd
ex
cited
and
foolish
in
helenes
presence
as
a
lover
should
be
but
had
not
yet
proposed
to
her
.
this
is
all
very
fine
but
things
must
be
set
tled
said
prince
vasili
to
himself
with
a
sor
rowful
sigh
one
morning
feeling
that
pierre
who
was
under
such
obligations
to
him
but
never
mind
that
was
not
behaving
very
well
in
this
matter
.
youth
frivolity

.

.

.
well
god
be
with
him
thought
he
relishing
his
own
goodness
of
heart
but
it
must
be
brought
to
a
head
.
the
day
after
tomorrow
will
be
lelyas
name
day
.
i
will
invite
two
or
three
people
and
if
he
does
not
understand
what
he
ought
to
do
then
it
will
be
my
affair
yes
my
affair
.
i
am
her
father
.
six
weeks
after
anna
pavlovnas
at
home
and
after
the
sleepless
night
when
he
had
de
cided
that
to
marry
helene
would
be
a
calam
ity
and
that
he
ought
to
avoid
her
and
go
away
pierre
despite
that
decision
had
not
left
prince
vasilis
and
felt
with
terror
that
in
peoples
eyes
he
was
every
day
more
and
more
connected
with
her
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
re
turn
to
his
former
conception
of
her
that
he
could
not
break
away
from
her
and
that
though
it
would
be
a
terrible
thing
he
would
have
to
unite
his
fate
with
hers
.
he
might
perhaps
have
been
able
to
free
himself
but
that
prince
vasili
who
had
rarely
before
given
receptions
now
hardly
let
a
day
go
by
without
having
an
even
ing
party
at
which
pierre
had
to
be
present
un
less
he
wished
to
spoil
the
general
pleasure
and
disappoint
everyones
expectation
.
prince
va
sili
in
the
rare
moments
when
he
was
at
home
would
take
pierres
hand
in
passing
and
draw
it
downwards
or
absentmindedly
hold
out
his
wrinkled
cleanshaven
cheek
for
pierre
to
kiss
and
would
say
till
tomorrow
or
be
in
to
dinner
or
i
shall
not
see
you
or
i
am
staying
in
for
your
sake
and
so
on
.
and
though
prince
vasili
when
he
stayed
in
as
he
said
for
pierres
sake
hardly
exchanged
a
couple
of
words
with
him
pierre
felt
unable
to
disap
point
him
.
every
day
he
said
to
himself
one
and
the
same
thing
it
is
time
i
understood
her
and
made
up
my
mind
what
she
really
is
.
was
1
mistaken
before
or
am
i
mistaken
now
no
she
is
not
stupid
she
is
an
excellent
girl
he
sometimes
said
to
himself
she
never
makes
a
mistake
never
says
anything
stupid
.
she
says
little
but
what
she
does
say
is
always
clear
and
simple
so
she
is
not
stupid
.
she
never
was
abashed
and
is
not
abashed
now
so
she
cannot
be
a
bad
woman
he
had
of
ten
begun
to
make
reflections
or
think
aloud
in
her
company
and
she
had
always
answered
him
either
by
a
brief
but
appropriate
remark
showing
that
it
did
not
interest
her
or
by
a
silent
look
and
smile
which
more
palpably
than
anything
else
showed
pierre
her
superiority
.
she
was
right
in
regard
ing
all
arguments
as
nonsense
in
comparison
with
that
smile
.
she
always
addressed
him
with
a
radiantly
confiding
smile
meant
for
him
alone
in
which
there
was
something
more
significant
than
in
the
general
smile
that
usually
brightened
her
face
.
pierre
knew
that
everyone
was
waiting
for
him
to
say
a
word
and
cross
a
certain
line
and
he
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
step
across
it
but
an
incomprehensible
terror
seized
him
at
the
thought
of
that
dreadful
step
.
a
thousand
times
during
that
month
and
a
half
while
he
felt
himself
drawn
nearer
and
nearer
to
that
dreadful
abyss
pierre
said
to
himself
what
am
i
doing
i
need
resolution
.
can
it
be
that
i
have
none
he
wished
to
take
a
decision
but
felt
with
dismay
that
in
this
matter
he
lacked
that
strength
of
will
which
he
had
known
in
him
self
and
really
possessed
.
pierre
was
one
of
those
who
are
only
strong
when
they
feel
themselves
quite
innocent
and
since
that
day
when
he
was
overpowered
by
a
feeling
of
de
sire
while
stooping
over
the
snuffbox
at
anna
pavlovnas
an
unacknowledged
sense
of
the
n6
war
and
peace
guilt
of
that
desire
paralyzed
his
will
.
on
hlnes
name
day
a
small
party
of
just
their
own
people
as
his
wife
said
met
for
sup
per
at
prince
vasilis
.
all
these
friends
and
re
lations
had
been
given
to
understand
that
the
fate
of
the
young
girl
would
be
decided
that
evening
.
the
visitors
were
seated
at
supper
.
princess
kuragina
a
portly
imposing
woman
who
had
once
been
handsome
was
sitting
at
the
head
of
the
table
.
on
either
side
of
her
sat
the
more
important
guests
an
old
general
and
his
wife
and
anna
pdvlovna
schdrer
.
at
the
other
end
sat
the
younger
and
less
important
guests
and
there
too
sat
the
members
of
the
family
and
pierre
and
hlne
side
by
side
.
prince
vasili
was
not
having
any
supper
he
went
round
the
table
in
a
merry
mood
sitting
down
now
by
one
now
by
another
of
the
guests
.
to
each
of
them
he
made
some
careless
and
agreeable
remark
except
to
pierre
and
hei
ne
whose
presence
he
seemed
not
to
notice
.
he
enlivened
the
whole
party
.
the
wax
can
dles
burned
brightly
the
silver
and
crystal
gleamed
so
did
the
ladies
toilets
and
the
gold
and
silver
of
the
mens
epaulets
servants
in
scar
let
liveries
moved
round
the
table
and
the
clat
ter
of
plates
knives
and
glasses
mingled
with
the
animated
hum
of
several
conversations
.
at
one
end
of
the
table
the
old
chamberlain
was
heard
assuring
an
old
baroness
that
he
loved
her
passionately
at
which
she
laughed
at
the
other
could
be
heard
the
story
of
the
misfor
tunes
of
some
mary
viktorovna
or
other
.
at
the
center
of
the
table
prince
vasili
attracted
everybodys
attention
.
with
a
facetious
smile
on
his
face
he
was
telling
the
ladies
about
last
wednesdays
meeting
of
the
imperial
council
at
which
sergey
kuzmich
vyazmftinov
the
new
military
governor
general
of
petersburg
had
received
and
read
the
then
famous
rescript
of
the
emperor
alexander
from
the
army
to
ser
gey
kuzmich
in
which
the
emperor
said
that
he
was
receiving
from
all
sides
declarations
of
the
peoples
loyalty
that
the
declaration
from
petersburg
gave
him
particular
pleasure
and
that
he
was
proud
to
be
at
the
head
of
such
a
nation
and
would
endeavor
to
be
worthy
of
it
.
this
rescript
began
with
the
words
sergey
kuzmich
from
all
sides
reports
reach
me
etc
.
well
and
so
he
never
got
farther
than
sergey
kuzmich
asked
one
of
the
ladies
.
exactly

poor
vyazmitinov
could

he
began
the
rescript
again
and
again
but
as
soon
as
he
uttered

he
sobbed
kuzmich
tears
and
from
all
sides
was
smothered
in
sobs
and
he
could
get
no
far
ther
.
and
again
his
handkerchief
and
again
sergey
kuzmich
from
all
sides

.

.

.
and
tears
till
at
last
somebody
else
was
asked
to
read
it

and
then
tears
someone
repeated
laughing
.
dont
be
unkind
cried
anna
pdvlovna
from
her
end
of
the
table
holding
up
a
threat
ening
finger
.
he
is
such
a
worthy
and
excellent
man
our
dear
vyazmitinov

everybody
laughed
a
great
deal
.
at
the
head
of
the
table
where
the
honored
guests
sat
ev
eryone
seemed
to
be
in
high
spirits
and
under
the
influence
of
a
variety
of
exciting
sensations
.
only
pierre
and
hellene
sat
silently
side
by
side
almost
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
a
sup
pressed
smile
brightening
both
their
faces
a
smile
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
sergey
kuz
mfch
a
smile
of
bashfulness
at
their
own
feel
ings
.
but
much
as
all
the
rest
laughed
talked
and
joked
much
as
they
enjoyed
their
rhine
wine
saute
and
ices
and
however
they
avoid
ed
looking
at
the
young
couple
and
heedless
and
unobservant
as
they
seemed
of
them
one
could
feel
by
the
occasional
glances
they
gave
that
the
story
about
sergey
kuzmfch
the
laughter
and
the
food
were
all
a
pretense
and
that
the
whole
attention
of
that
company
was
directed
to
pierre
and
hlne
.
prince
vasili
mimicked
the
sobbing
of
sergey
kuzmfch
and
at
the
same
time
his
eyes
glanced
toward
his
daughter
and
while
he
laughed
the
expression
on
his
face
clearly
said
yes

.

.

.
its
getting
on
it
will
all
be
settled
today
.
anna
pdvlovna
threatened
him
on
behalf
of
our
dear
vyaz
mitinov
and
in
her
eyes
which
for
an
in
stant
glanced
at
pierre
prince
vasfli
read
a
congratulation
on
his
future
soninlaw
and
on
his
daughters
happiness
.
the
old
princess
sighed
sadly
as
she
offered
some
wine
to
the
old
lady
next
to
her
and
glanced
angrily
at
her
daughter
and
her
sigh
seemed
to
say
yes
theres
nothing
left
for
you
and
me
but
to
sip
sweet
wine
my
dear
now
that
the
time
has
come
for
these
young
ones
to
be
thus
boldly
provocatively
happy
.
and
what
nonsense
all
this
is
that
i
am
saying
thought
a
diploma
tist
glancing
at
the
happy
faces
of
the
lovers
.
thats
happiness
into
the
insignificant
trifling
and
artificial
interests
uniting
that
society
had
entered
the
simple
feeling
of
the
attraction
of
a
healthy
and
handsome
young
man
and
woman
for
one
another
.
and
this
human
feeling
dominated
book
everything
else
and
soared
above
all
their
af
fected
chatter
.
jests
fell
flat
news
was
not
in
teresting
and
the
animation
was
evidently
forced
.
not
only
the
guests
but
even
the
foot
men
waiting
at
table
seemed
to
feel
this
and
they
forgot
their
duties
as
they
looked
at
the
beautiful
helene
with
her
radiant
face
and
at
the
red
broad
and
happy
though
uneasy
face
of
pierre
.
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
light
of
the
candles
was
focused
on
those
two
happy
faces
alone
.
pierre
felt
that
he
was
the
center
of
it
all
and
this
both
pleased
and
embarrassed
him
.
he
was
like
a
man
entirely
absorbed
in
some
occupa
tion
.
he
did
not
see
hear
or
understand
any
thing
clearly
.
only
now
and
then
detached
ideas
and
impressions
from
the
world
of
reality
shot
unexpectedly
through
his
mind
.
so
it
is
all
finished
he
thought
.
and
how
has
it
all
happened
how
quickly
1
now
i
know
that
not
because
of
her
alone
nor
of
myself
alone
but
because
of
everyone
it
must
inevi
tably
come
about
.
they
are
all
expecting
it
they
are
so
sure
that
it
will
happen
that
i
can
not
i
cannot
disappoint
them
.
but
how
will
it
be
i
do
not
know
but
it
will
certainly
happen
thought
pierre
glancingat
those
dazzlingshoul
ders
close
to
his
eyes
.
or
he
would
suddenly
feel
ashamed
of
he
knew
not
what
.
he
felt
it
awkward
to
attract
everyones
attention
and
to
be
considered
a
lucky
man
and
with
his
plain
face
to
be
looked
on
as
a
sort
of
paris
possessed
of
a
helen
.
but
no
doubt
it
always
is
and
must
be
so
he
con
soled
himself
.
and
besides
what
have
i
done
to
bring
it
about
how
did
it
begin
i
traveled
from
moscow
with
prince
vasfli
.
then
there
was
nothing
.
so
why
should
i
not
stay
at
his
house
then
i
played
cards
with
her
and
picked
up
her
reticule
and
drove
out
with
her
.
how
did
it
begin
when
did
it
all
come
about
and
here
he
was
sitting
by
her
side
as
her
betrothed
seeing
hearing
feel
ing
her
nearness
her
breath
ing
her
movements
her
beauty
.
then
it
would
suddenly
seem
to
him
that
it
was
not
she
but
he
who
was
so
unusually
beautiful
and
that
that
was
why
they
all
looked
so
at
him
and
flattered
by
this
general
admiration
he
would
expand
his
chest
raise
his
head
and
re
joice
at
his
good
fortune
.
suddenly
he
heard
a
familiar
voice
repeating
something
to
him
a
second
time
.
but
pierre
was
so
absorbed
that
he
did
not
understand
what
was
said
.
i
am
asking
you
when
you
last
heard
from
bolk6nski
repeated
prince
vasfli
a
third
time
.
how
absentminded
you
are
my
dear
fellow
.
three
117
prince
vastti
smiled
and
pierre
noticed
that
everyone
was
smiling
at
him
and
helene
.
well
what
of
it
if
you
all
know
it
thought
pierre
.
what
of
it
its
the
truth
and
he
him
self
smiled
his
gentle
childlike
smile
and
hel
ene
smiled
too
.
when
did
you
get
the
letter
was
it
from
olmiitz
repeated
prince
vasfli
who
pretend
ed
to
want
to
know
this
in
order
to
settle
a
dispute
.
how
can
one
talk
or
think
of
such
trifles
thought
pierre
.
yes
from
olmiitz
he
answered
with
a
sigh
.
after
supper
pierre
with
his
partner
fol
lowed
the
others
into
the
drawing
room
.
the
guests
began
to
disperse
some
without
taking
leave
of
hlne
.
some
as
if
unwilling
to
dis
tract
her
from
an
important
occupation
came
up
to
her
for
a
moment
and
made
haste
to
go
away
refusing
to
let
her
see
them
off
.
the
di
plomatist
preserved
a
mournful
silence
as
he
left
the
drawing
room
.
he
pictured
the
vanity
of
his
diplomatic
career
in
comparison
with
pierres
happiness
.
the
old
general
grumbled
at
his
wife
when
she
asked
how
his
leg
was
.
oh
the
old
fool
he
thought
.
that
princess
hlene
will
be
beautiful
still
when
shes
fifty
.
i
think
i
may
congratulate
you
whispered
anna
pdvlovna
to
the
old
princess
kissing
her
soundly
.
if
i
hadnt
this
headache
id
have
stayed
longer
.
the
old
princess
did
not
reply
she
was
tor
mented
by
jealousy
of
her
daughters
happiness
.
while
the
guests
were
taking
their
leave
pierre
remained
for
a
long
time
alone
with
helene
in
the
little
drawing
room
where
they
were
sitting
.
he
had
often
before
during
the
last
six
weeks
remained
alone
with
her
but
had
never
spoken
to
her
of
love
.
now
he
felt
that
it
was
inevitable
but
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
take
the
final
step
.
he
felt
ashamed
he
felt
that
he
was
occupying
someone
elses
place
here
beside
hlne
.
this
happiness
is
not
for
you
some
inner
voice
whispered
to
him
.
this
happiness
is
for
those
who
have
not
in
them
what
there
is
in
you
.
but
as
he
had
to
say
something
he
began
by
asking
her
whether
she
was
satisfied
with
the
party
.
she
replied
in
her
usual
simple
manner
that
this
name
day
of
hers
had
been
one
of
the
pleasantest
she
had
ever
had
.
some
of
the
nearest
relatives
had
not
yet
left
.
they
were
sitting
in
the
large
drawing
room
.
prince
vasfli
came
up
to
pierre
with
languid
footsteps
.
pierre
rose
and
said
it
was
getting
n8
war
and
peace
late
.
prince
vasfli
gave
him
a
look
of
stern
in
quiry
as
though
what
pierre
had
just
said
was
so
strange
that
one
could
not
take
it
in
.
but
then
the
expression
of
severity
changed
and
he
drew
pierres
hand
downwards
made
him
sit
down
and
smiled
affectionately
.
well
lelya
he
asked
turning
instantly
to
his
daughter
and
addressing
her
with
the
careless
tone
of
habitual
tenderness
natural
to
parents
who
have
petted
their
children
from
babyhood
but
which
prince
vasili
had
only
acquired
by
imitating
other
parents
.
and
he
again
turned
to
pierre
.
sergey
kuzmfch
from
all
sides
he
said
unbuttoning
the
top
button
of
his
waistcoat
.
pierre
smiled
but
his
smile
showed
that
he
knew
it
was
not
the
story
about
sergey
kuz
mfch
that
interested
prince
vasfli
just
then
and
prince
vasili
saw
that
pierre
knew
this
.
he
suddenly
muttered
something
and
went
away
.
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
even
the
prince
was
disconcerted
.
the
sight
of
the
discompo
sure
of
that
old
man
of
the
world
touched
pierre
he
looked
at
hlene
and
she
too
seemed
disconcerted
and
her
look
seemed
to
say
well
it
is
your
own
fault
.
the
step
must
be
taken
but
i
cannot
i
can
not
thought
pierre
and
he
again
began
speak
ing
about
indifferent
matters
about
sergey
kuzmfch
asking
what
the
point
of
the
story
was
as
he
had
not
heard
it
properly
.
hellene
answered
with
a
smile
that
she
too
had
missed
it
.
when
prince
vasfli
returned
to
the
drawing
room
the
princess
his
wife
was
talking
in
low
tones
to
the
elderly
lady
about
pierre
.
of
course
it
is
a
very
brilliant
match
but
happiness
my
dear

.

.

.
marriages
are
made
in
heaven
replied
the
elderly
lady
.
prince
vasili
passed
by
seeming
not
to
hear
the
ladies
and
sat
down
on
a
sofa
in
a
far
cor
ner
of
the
room
.
he
closed
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
be
dozing
.
his
head
sank
forward
and
then
he
roused
himself
.
aline
he
said
to
his
wife
go
and
see
what
they
are
about
.
the
princess
went
up
to
the
door
passed
by
it
with
a
dignified
and
indifferent
air
and
glanced
into
the
little
drawing
room
.
pierre
and
hene
still
sat
talking
just
as
before
.
still
the
same
she
said
to
her
husband
.
prince
vasili
frowned
twisting
his
mouth
his
cheeks
quivered
and
his
face
assumed
the
coarse
unpleasant
expression
peculiar
to
him
.
shaking
himself
he
rose
threw
back
his
head
and
with
resolute
steps
went
past
the
ladies
in
to
the
little
drawing
room
.
with
quick
steps
he
went
joyfully
up
to
pierre
.
his
face
was
so
un
usually
triumphant
that
pierre
rose
in
alarm
on
seeing
it
.
thank
god
said
prince
vasfli
.
my
wife
has
told
me
everything
he
put
one
arm
around
pierre
and
the
other
around
his
daugh
ter
.
my
dear
boy

..
.
i
am
very
pleased

his
voice
trembled
.
i
loved

father

.

.

.
and
she
will
make
you
a
good
wife

.

.

.
god
bless
you

.

.

.
he
embraced
his
daughter
and
then
again
pierre
and
kissed
him
with
his
malodorous
mouth
.
tears
actually
moistened
his
cheeks
.
princess
come
here
he
shouted
.
the
old
princess
came
in
and
also
wept
.
the
elderly
lady
was
using
her
handkerchief
too
.
pierre
was
kissed
and
he
kissed
the
beautiful
hdlnes
hand
several
times
.
after
a
while
they
were
left
alone
again
.
all
this
had
to
be
and
could
not
be
other
wise
thought
pierre
so
it
is
useless
to
ask
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
.
it
is
good
because
its
definite
and
one
is
rid
of
the
old
torment
ing
doubt
.
pierre
held
the
hand
of
his
be
trothed
in
silence
looking
at
her
beautiful
bos
om
as
it
rose
and
fell
.
helene
he
said
aloud
and
paused
.
something
special
is
always
said
in
such
cases
he
thought
but
could
not
remember
what
it
was
that
people
say
.
he
looked
at
her
face
.
she
drew
nearer
to
him
.
her
face
flushed
.
oh
take
those
off

..
.
those

.

.

.
she
said
pointing
to
his
spectacles
.
pierre
took
them
off
and
his
eyes
besides
the
strange
look
eyes
have
from
which
spec
tacles
have
just
been
removed
had
also
a
fright
ened
arid
inquiring
look
.
he
was
about
tostoop
over
her
hand
and
kiss
it
but
with
a
rapid
al
most
brutal
movement
of
her
head
she
inter
cepted
his
lips
and
met
them
with
her
own
.
her
face
struck
pierre
by
its
altered
unpleas
antly
excited
expression
.
it
is
too
late
now
its
done
besides
i
love
her
thought
pierre
.
je
vous
aime

he
said
remembering
what
has
to
be
said
at
such
moments
but
his
words
sounded
so
weak
that
he
felt
ashamed
of
him
self
.
six
weeks
later
he
was
married
and
settled
in
count
beziikhovs
large
newly
furnished
pe
tersburg
house
the
happy
possessor
as
people
said
of
a
wife
who
was
a
celebrated
beauty
and
of
millions
of
money

iii
old
prince
nicholas
bolknski
received
a
letter
from
prince
vasili
in
november
1805
announcing
that
he
and
his
son
would
be
pay
ing
him
a
visit
.
i
am
starting
on
a
journey
of
inspection
and
of
course
i
shall
think
nothing
of
an
extra
seventy
miles
to
come
and
see
you
at
the
same
time
my
honored
benefactor
wrote
prince
vasili
.
my
son
anatole
is
accom
panying
me
on
his
way
to
the
army
so
i
hope
you
will
allow
him
personally
to
express
the
deep
respect
that
emulating
his
father
he
feels
for
you
.
it
seems
that
there
will
be
no
need
to
bring
mary
out
suitors
are
coming
to
us
of
their
own
accord
incautiously
remarked
the
little
prin
cess
on
hearing
the
news
.
prince
nicholas
frowned
but
said
nothing
.
a
fortnight
after
the
letter
prince
vasilis
servants
came
one
evening
in
advance
of
him
and
he
and
his
son
arrived
next
day
.
old
bolk6nski
had
always
had
a
poor
opin
ion
of
prince
vasflis
character
but
more
so
recently
since
in
the
new
reigns
of
paul
arid
alexander
prince
vasili
had
risen
to
high
po
sition
and
honors
.
and
now
from
the
hints
contained
in
his
letter
and
given
by
the
little
princess
he
saw
which
way
the
wind
was
blow
ing
and
his
low
opinion
changed
intoa
feeling
of
contemptuous
ill
will
.
he
snorted
whenev
er
he
mentioned
him
.
on
the
day
of
prince
va
silis
arrival
prince
bolkonski
was
particularly
discontented
and
out
of
temper
.
whether
he
was
in
a
bad
temper
because
prince
vasili
was
coming
or
whether
his
being
in
a
bad
temper
made
him
specially
annoyed
at
prince
vasilis
visit
he
was
in
a
bad
temper
and
in
the
morn
ing
tfkhon
had
already
advised
the
architect
not
to
go
the
prince
with
his
report
.
do
you
hear
how
hes
walking
said
tfk
hon
drawing
the
architects
attention
to
the
sound
of
the
princes
footsteps
.
stepping
flat
on
his
heels
we

what
that
means

however
at
nine
oclock
the
prince
in
his
velvet
coat
with
a
sable
collar
and
cap
went
out
for
his
usual
walk
.
it
had
snowed
the
day
before
and
the
path
to
the
hothouse
along
which
the
prince
was
in
the
habit
of
walking
had
been
swept
the
marks
of
the
broom
were
still
visible
in
the
snow
and
a
shovel
had
been
left
sticking
in
one
of
the
soft
snowbanks
that
bordered
both
sides
of
the
path
.
the
prince
went
through
the
conservatories
the
serfs
quarters
and
the
outbuildings
frowning
and
silent
.

asked

in
man
ners
and
looks
who
was
accompanying
him
back
to
the
house
.
the
snow
is
deep
.
i
am
having
the
avenue
swept
your
honor
.
the
prince
bowed
his
head
and
went
up
to
the
porch
.
god
be
thanked
thought
the
overseer
the
storm
has
blown
over
it
would
have
been
hard
to
drive
up
your
honor
he
added
.
i
heard
your
honor
that
a
minister
is
coming
to
visit
your
honor
.
the
prince
turned
round
to
the
overseer
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
him
frowning
.
what
a
minister
what
minister
who
gave
orders
he
said
in
his
shrill
harsh
voice
.
the
road
is
not
swept
for
the
princess
my
daughter
but
for
a
minister

the

rapidly

but
although
alpdtych
frightened
at
his
own
temerity
in
avoiding
the
stroke
came
up
to
the
prince
bowing
his
bald
head
resignedly
before
him
or
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
the
prince
though
he
continued
to

before
dinner
princess
mary
and
mademoi
selle
bourienne
who
knew
that
the
prince
was
in
a
bad
humor
stood
awaiting
him
mademoi

bourienne
with
a
radiant
face
that
said
i
know
nothing
i
am
the
same
as
usual
and
princess
mary
pale
frightened
and
with
down
cast
eyes
.
what
she
found
hardest
to
bear
was
to
know
that
on
such
occasions
she
ought
to
be
have
like
mademoiselle
bourienne
but
could
not
.
she
thought
if
i
seem
not
to
notice
he
will
think
that
i
do
not
sympathize
with
him
if
i
seem
sad
and
out
of
spirits
myself
he
will
say
as
he
has
done
before
that

.
the
prince
looked
at
his
daughters
fright
ened
face
and
snorted
.
fool

..
.
or
dummy
he
muttered
.
and
the
other
one
is
not
here
.
theyve
been
telling
tales
he
thoughtreferring
to
the
lit
tle
princess
who
was
not
in
the
dining
room
.
where
is
the
princess
he
asked
.
hiding
she
is
not
very
well
answered
mademoi
selle
bourienne
with
a
bright
smile
so
she
iso
war
and
peace
wont
come
down
.
it
is
natural
in
her
state
.
hm
hml
muttered
the
prince
sitting
down
.
his
plate
seemed
to
him
not
quite
dean
and
pointing
to
a
spot
he
flung
it
away
.
tikhon
caught
it
and
handed
it
to
a
footman
.
the
lit
tle
princess
was
not
unwell
but
had
such
an
overpowering
fear
of
the
prince
that
hearing
he
was
in
a
bad
humor
she
had
decided
not
to
appear
.
i
am
afraid
for
the
baby
she
said
to
made
moiselle
bourienne
heaven
knows
what
a
fright
might
do
.
in
general
at
bald
hills
the
little
princess
lived
in
constant
fear
and
with
a
sense
of
an
tipathy
to
the
old
prince
which
she
did
not
re
alize
because
the
fear
was
so
much
the
strong
er
feeling
.
the
prince
reciprocated
this
antip
athy
but
it
was
overpowered
by
his
contempt
for
her
.
when
the
little
princess
had
grown
accustomed
to
life
at
bald
hills
she
took
a
special
fancy
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
spent
whole
days
with
her
asked
her
to
sleep
in
her
room
and
often
talked
with
her
about
the
old
prince
and
criticized
him
.
so
we
are
to
have
visitors
mon
prince
re
marked
mademoiselle
bourienne
unfolding
her
white
napkin
with
her
rosy
fingers
.
his

prince
vasili

and
his

she
said
inquiringly
.
hml
his
excellency
is
a
puppy
.

..
.
i
got
him
his
appointment
in
the
service
said
the
prince
disdainfully
.
why
his
son
is
coming
i
dont
understand
.
perhaps
princess
elizabeth
and
princess
mary
know
.
i
dont
want
him
.
he
looked
at
his
blushing
daughter
.
are
you
unwell
today
eh
afraid
of
the
minister
as
that
idiot
alpdtych
called
him
this
morn
ing
no
mon
pkre
though
mademoiselle
bourienne
had
been
so
unsuccessful
in
her
choice
of
a
subject
she
did
not
stop
talking
but
chattered
about
the
conservatories
and
the
beauty
of
a
flower
that
had
just
opened
and
after
the
soup
the
prince
became
more
genial
.
after
dinner
he
went
to
see
his
daughterin
law
.
the
little
princess
was
sitting
at
a
small
table
chattering
with
msha
her
maid
.
she
grew
pale
on
seeing
her
fatherinlaw
.
she
was
much
altered
.
she
was
now
plain
rather
than
pretty
.
her
cheeks
had
sunk
her
lip
was
drawn
up
and
her
eyes
drawn
down
.
yes
i
feel
a
kind
of
oppression
she
said
in
reply
to
the
princes
question
as
to
how
she
felt
do
you
want
anything
no
merci
mon
ptre
.
well
all
right
all
right
.
he
left
the
room
and
went
to
the
waiting
room
where
alpdtych
stood
with
bowed
head
.
has
the
snow
been
shoveled
back
yes
your
excellency
.
forgive
me
for
heav
ens
sake

..
.
it
was
only
my
stupidity
.
all
right
all
right
interrupted
the
prince
and
laughing
in
his
unnatural
way
he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
alpdtych
to
kiss
and
then
pro
ceeded
to
his
study
.
prince
vasili
arrived
that
evening
.
he
was
met
in
the
avenue
by
coachmen
and
footmen
who
with
loud
shouts
dragged
his
sleighs
up
to
one
of
the
lodges
over
the
road
purposely
laden
with
snow
.
prince
vastti
and
anatole
had
separate
rooms
assigned
to
them
.
anatole
having
taken
off
his
overcoat
sat
with
arms
akimbo
before
a
table
on
a
corner
of
which
he
smilingly
and
absentmindedly
fixed
his
large
and
handsome
eyes
.
he
regarded
his
whole
life
as
a
continual
round
of
amusement
which
someone
for
some
reason
had
to
provide
for
him
.
and
he
looked
on
this
visit
to
a
churl
ish
old
man
and
a
rich
and
ugly
heiress
in
the
same
way
.
all
this
might
he
thought
turn
out
very
well
and
amusingly
.
and
why
not
marry
her
if
she
really
has
so
much
money
that
nev
er
does
any
harm
thought
anatole
.
he
shaved
and
scented
himself
with
the
care
and
elegance
which
had
become
habitual
to
him
and
his
handsome
head
held
high
entered
his
fathers
room
with
the
goodhumored
and
victorious
air
natural
to
him
.
prince
vasilis
two
valets
were
busy
dressing
him
and
he
looked
round
with
much
animation
and
cheer
fully
nodded
to
his
son
as
the
latter
entered
as
if
to
say
yes
thats
how
i
want
you
to
look
.
i
say
father
joking
apart
is
she
very
hid
eous
anatole
asked
as
if
continuing
a
con
versation
the
subject
of
which
had
often
been
mentioned
during
the
journey
.
enough
what
nonsensel
above
all
try
to
be
respectful
and
cautious
with
the
old
prince
.
if
he
starts
a
row
ill
go
away
said
prince
anatole
.
i
cant
bear
those
old
men
eh
remember
for
you
everything
depends
on
this
.
in
the
meantime
not
only
was
it
known
in
the
maidservants
rooms
that
the
minister
and
his
son
had
arrived
but
the
appearance
of
both
had
been
minutely
described
.
princess
mary
was
sitting
alone
in
her
room
vainly
trying
to
master
her
agitation
.
book
three
why
did
they
write
why
did
lise
tell
me
about
it
it
can
never
happen
she
said
look
ing
at
herself
in
the
glass
.
howshall
i
enter
the
drawing
room
even
if
i
like
him
i
cant
now
be
myself
with
him
.
the
mere
thought
of
her
fathers
look
filled
her
with
terror
.
the
little
princess
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
had
al
ready
received
from
mdsha
the
ladys
maid
the
necessary
report
of
how
handsome
the
min
isters
son
was
with
his
rosy
cheeks
and
dark
eyebrows
and
with
what
difficulty
the
father
had
dragged
his
legs
upstairs
while
the
son
had
followed
him
like
an
eagle
three
steps
at
a
time
.
having
received
this
information
the
little
princess
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
whose
chattering
voices
had
reached
her
from
the
cor
ridor
went
into
princess
marys
room
.
you
know
theyve
come
marie
said
the
little
princess
waddling
in
and
sinking
heav
ily
into
an
armchair
.
she
was
no
longer
in
the
loose
gown
she
gen
erally
wore
in
the
morning
but
had
on
one
of
her
best
dresses
.
her
hair
was
carefully
done
and
her
face
was
animated
which
however
did
not
conceal
its
sunken
and
faded
outlines
.
dressed
as
she
used
to
be
in
petersburg
society
it
was
still
more
noticeable
how
much
plainer
she
had
become
.
some
unobtrusive
touch
had
been
added
to
mademoiselle
bouriennes
toi
let
which
rendered
her
fresh
and
pretty
face
yet
more
attractive
.
what
are
you
going
to
remain
as
you
are
dear
princess
she
began
.
theyll
be
an
nouncing
that
the
gentlemen
are
in
the
draw
ing
room
and
we
shall
have
to
go
down
and
you
have
not
smartened
yourself
up
at
all
the
little
princess
got
up
rang
for
the
maid
and
hurriedly
and
merrily
began
to
devise
and
carry
out
a
plan
of
how
princess
mary
should
be
dressed
.
princess
marys
selfesteem
was
wounded
by
the
fact
that
the
arrival
of
a
suitor
agitated
her
and
still
more
so
by
both
her
com
panions
not
having
the
least
conception
that
it
could
be
otherwise
.
to
tell
them
that
she
felt
ashamed
for
herself
and
for
them
would
be
to
betray
her
agitation
while
to
decline
their
of
fers
to
dress
her
would
prolong
their
banter
and
insistence
.
she
flushed
her
beautiful
eyes
grew
dim
red
blotches
came
on
her
face
and
it
took
on
the
unattractive
martyrlike
expression
it
so
often
wore
as
she
submitted
herself
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
lise
.
both
these
women
quite
sincerely
tried
to
make
her
look
pretty
.
she
was
so
plain
that
neither
of
them
could
think
of
her
as
a
rival
so
they
began
dressing
her
with
perfect
sincerity
and
with
121
the
naive
and
firm
conviction
women
have
that
dress
can
make
a
face
pretty
.
no
really
my
dear
this
dress
is
not
pretty
said
lise
looking
sideways
at
princess
mary
from
a
little
distance
.
you
have
a
maroon
dress
have
it
fetched
.
really
you
know
the
fate
of
your
whole
life
may
be
at
stake
.
but
this
one
is
too
light
its
not
becoming
it
was
not
the
dress
but
the
face
and
whole
figure
of
princess
mary
that
was
not
pretty
but
neither
mademoiselle
bourienne
nor
the
little
princess
felt
this
they
still
thought
that
if
a
blue
ribbon
were
placed
in
the
hair
the
hair
combed
up
and
the
blue
scarf
arranged
lower
on
the
best
maroon
dress
and
so
on
all
would
be
well
.
they
forgot
that
the
frightened
face
and
the
figure
could
not
be
altered
and
that
however
they
might
change
the
setting
and
adornment
of
that
face
it
would
still
remain
piteous
and
plain
.
after
two
or
three
changes
to
which
princess
mary
meekly
submitted
just
as
her
hair
had
been
arranged
on
the
top
of
her
head
a
style
that
quite
altered
and
spoiled
her
looks
and
she
had
put
on
a
maroon
dress
with
a
paleblue
scarf
the
little
princess
walked
twice
round
her
now
adjusting
a
fold
of
the
dress
with
her
little
hand
now
arranging
the
scarf
and
looking
at
her
with
her
head
bent
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
.
no
it
will
not
do
she
said
decidedly
clasp
ing
her
hands
.
no
mary
really
this
dress
does
not
suit
you
.
i
prefer
you
in
your
little
gray
everyday
dress
.
now
please
do
it
for
my
sake
.
katie
she
said
to
the
maid
bring
the
prin
cess
her
gray
dress
and
youll
see
mademoi
selle
bourienne
how
i
shall
arrange
it
she
addedsmilingwith
a
foretaste
of
artistic
pleas
ure
.
but
when
katie
brought
the
required
dress
princess
mary
remained
sitting
motionless
be
fore
the
glass
looking
at
her
face
and
saw
in
the
mirror
her
eyes
full
of
tears
and
her
mouth
quivering
ready
to
burst
into
sobs
.
come
dear
princess
said
mademoiselle
bourienne
just
one
more
little
effort
.
the
little
princess
taking
the
dress
from
the
maid
came
up
to
princess
mary
.
well
now
well
arrange
something
quite
simple
and
becoming
she
said
.
the
three
voices
hers
mademoiselle
bouri
ennes
and
katies
who
was
laughing
at
some
thing
mingled
in
a
merry
sound
like
the
chirp
ing
of
birds
.
no
leave
me
alone
said
princess
mary
.
her
voice
sounded
so
serious
and
so
sad
that
the
chirping
of
the
birds
was
silenced
at
once
.
122
they
looked
at
the
beautiful
large
thought
ful
eyes
full
of
tears
and
of
thoughts
gazing
shiningly
and
imploringly
at
them
and
under
stood
that
it
was
useless
and
even
cruel
to
in
sist
.
at
least
change
your
coiffure
said
the
lit
tle
princess
.
didnt
i
tell
you
she
went
on
turning
reproachfully
to
mademoiselle
bouri
enne
marys
is
a
face
which
such
a
coiffure
does
not
suit
in
the
least
.
not
in
the
least
please
change
it
.
leave
me
alone
please
leave
me
alone
it
is
all
quite
the
same
to
me
answered
a
voice
struggling
with
tears
.
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
the
little
prin
cess
had
to
own
to
themselves
that
princess
mary
in
this
guise
looked
very
plain
worse
than
usual
but
it
was
too
late
.
she
was
looking
at
them
with
an
expression
they
both
knew
an
expression
thoughtful
and
sad
.
this
expres
sion
in
princess
mary
did
not
frighten
them
she
never
inspired
fear
in
anyone
but
they
knew
that
when
it
appeared
on
her
face
she
became
mute
and
was
not
to
be
shaken
in
her
determination
.
you
will
change
it
wont
you
said
lise
.
and
as
princess
mary
gave
no
answer
she
left
the
room
.
princess
mary
was
left
alone
.
she
did
not
comply
with
lises
request
she
not
only
left
her
hair
as
it
was
but
did
not
even
look
in
her
glass
.
letting
her
arms
fall
helplessly
she
sat
with
downcast
eyes
and
pondered
.
a
husband
a
man
a
strong
dominant
and
strangely
attrac
tive
being
rose
in
her
imagination
and
carried
her
into
a
totally
different
happy
world
of
his
own
.
she
fancied
a
child
her
ouw
such
as
she
had
seen
the
day
before
in
the
arms
of
her
nurses

at
her
own
breast
the
hus
band
standing
by
and
gazing
tenderly
at
her
and
the
child
.
but
no
it
is
impossible
i
am
too
ugly
she
thought
.
please
come
to
tea
.
the
prince
will
be
out
in
a
moment
came
the
maids
voice
at
the
door
.
she
roused
herself
and
felt
appalled
at
what
she
had
been
thinking
and
before
going
down
she
went
into
the
room
where
the
icons
hung
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
dark
face
of
a
large
icon
of
the
saviour
lit
by
a
lamp
she
stood
be
fore
it
with
folded
hands
for
a
few
moments
.
a
painful
doubt
filled
her
soul
.
could
the
joy
of
love
of
earthly
love
for
a
man
be
for
her
in
her
thoughts
of
marriage
princess
mary
dreamed
of
happiness
and
of
children
but
her
strongest
most
deeply
hidden
longing
was
for
war
and
peace
earthly
love
.
the
more
she
tried
to
hide
this
feeling
from
others
and
even
from
herself
the
stronger
it
grew
.
o
god
she
said
how
am
i
to
stifle
in
my
heart
these
temptations
of
the
devil
how
am
i
to
renounce
forever
these
vile
fancies
so
as
peacefully
to
fulfill
thy
will
and
scarcely
had
she
put
that
question
than
god
gave
her
the
answer
in
her
own
heart
.
desire
nothing
for
thyself
seek
nothing
be
not
anxious
or
envious
.
mans
future
and
thy
own
fate
must
remain
hidden
from
thee
but
live
so
that
thou
mayest
be
ready
for
anything
.
if
it
be
gods
will
to
prove
thee
in
the
duties
of
marriage
be
ready
to
fulfill
his
will
.
with
this
consoling
thought
but
yet
with
a
hope
for
the
fulfillment
of
her
forbidden
earthly
longing
princess
mary
sighed
and
having
crossed
herself
went
down
thinking
neither
of
her
gown
and
coifture
nor
of
how
she
would
go
in
nor
of
what
she
would
say
.
what
could
all
that
matter
in
comparison
with
the
will
of
god
without
whose
care
not
a
hair
of
mans
head
can
fall
chapter
iv
when
princess
mary
came
down
prince
va
sili
and
his
son
were
already
in
the
drawing
room
talking
to
the
little
princess
and
made
moiselle
bourienne
.
when
she
entered
with
her
heavy
step
treading
on
her
heels
the
gen
tlemen
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
rose
and
the
little
princess
indicating
her
to
the
gentle
men
said
voila
marie
princess
mary
saw
them
all
and
saw
them
in
detail
.
she
saw
prince
vasilis
face
serious
for
an
instant
at
the
sight
of
her
but
immediately
smiling
again
and
the
little
princess
curiously
noting
the
impression
marie
produced
on
the
visitors
.
and
she
saw
mademoiselle
bourienne
with
her
ribbon
and
pretty
face
and
her
unusually
animated
look
which
was
fixed
on
him
but
him
she
could
not
see
she
only
saw
something
large
brilliant
and
handsome
moving
toward
her
as
she
en
tered
the
room
.
prince
vasf
li
approached
first
and
she
kissed
the
bold
forehead
that
bent
over
her
hand
and
answered
his
question
by
saying
that
on
the
contrary
she
remembered
him
quite
well
.
then
anatole
came
up
to
her
.
she
still
could
not
see
him
.
she
only
felt
a
soft
hand
taking
hers
firmly
and
she
touched
with
her
lips
a
white
forehead
over
which
was
beau
tiful
lightbrown
hair
smelling
of
pomade
.
when
she
looked
up
at
him
she
was
struck
by
his
beauty
.
anatole
stood
with
his
right
thumb
under
a
button
of
his
uniform
his
chest
ex
panded
and
his
back
drawn
in
slightly
swing
book
ing
one
foot
and
with
his
head
a
little
bent
looked
with
beaming
face
at
the
princess
with
out
speaking
and
evidently
not
thinking
about
her
at
all
.
anatole
was
not
quickwitted
nor
ready
or
eloquent
in
conversation
but
he
had
the
faculty
so
invaluable
in
society
of
compo
sure
and
imperturbable
selfpossession
.
if
a
man
lacking
in
selfconfidence
remains
dumb
on
a
first
introduction
and
betrays
a
conscious
ness
of
the
impropriety
of
such
silence
and
an
anxiety
to
find
something
to
say
the
effect
is
bad
.
but
anatole
was
dumb
swung
his
foot
and
smilingly
examined
the
princess
hair
.
it
was
evident
that
he
could
be
silent
in
this
way
for
a
very
long
time
.
if
anyone
finds
this
silence
inconvenient
let
him
talk
but
i
dont
want
to
he
seemed
to
say
.
besides
this
in
his
be
havior
to
women
anatole
had
a
manner
which
particularly
inspires
in
them
curiosity
awe
and
even
lovea
supercilious
consciousness
of
his
own
superiority
.
it
was
as
if
he
said
to
them
i
know
you
i
know
you
but
why
should
i
bother
about
you
youd
be
only
too
glad
of
course
.
perhaps
he
did
not
really
think
this
when
he
met
women
even
probably
he
did
not
for
in
general
he
thought
very
little
but
his
looks
and
manner
gave
that
impression
.
the
princess
felt
this
and
as
if
wishing
to
show
him
that
she
did
not
even
dare
expect
to
in
terest
him
she
turned
to
his
father
.
the
con
versation
was
general
and
animated
thanks
to
princess
lises
voice
and
little
downy
lip
that
lifted
over
her
white
teeth
.
she
met
prince
va
sfli
with
that
playful
manner
often
employed
by
lively
chatty
people
and
consisting
in
the
assumption
that
between
the
person
they
so
address
and
themselves
there
are
some
semi
private
longestablished
jokes
and
amusing
reminiscences
though
no
such
reminiscences
really
existjust
as
none
existed
in
this
case
.
prince
vasfli
readily
adopted
her
tone
and
the
little
princess
also
drew
anatole
whom
she
hardly
knew
into
these
amusing
recollections
of
things
that
had
never
occurred
.
mademoi
selle
bourienne
also
shared
them
and
even
princess
mary
felt
herself
pleasantly
made
to
share
in
these
merry
reminiscences
.
here
at
least
we
shall
have
the
benefit
of
your
company
all
to
ourselves
dear
prince
said
the
little
princess
of
course
in
french
to

vasili

three
and
our
little
tea
table
oh
yes
why
is
it
you
were
never
at
annettes
the
little
princess
asked
anatole
.
ah
i
know
i
know
she
said
with
a
sly
glance
your
broth
er
hippolyte
told
me
about
your
goings
on
.
oh
and
she
shook
her
finger
at
him
i
have
even
heard
of
your
doings
in
paris
and
didnt
hippolyte
tell
you
asked
prince
vasili
turning
to
his
son
and
seizing
the
little
princess
arm
as
if
she
would
have
run
away
and
he
had
just
managed
to
catch
her
didnt
he
tell
you
how
he
himself
was
pining
for
the
dear
princess
and
how
she
showed
him
the
door
oh
she
is
a
pearl
among
women
princess
he
added
turning
to
princess
mary
.
when
paris
was
mentioned
mademoiselle
bourienne
for
her
part
seized
the
opportunity
of
joining
in
the
general
current
of
recollec
tions
.
she
took
the
liberty
of
inquiring
whether
it
was
long
since
anatole
had
left
paris
and
how
he
had
liked
that
city
.
anatole
answered
the
frenchwoman
very
readily
and
looking
at
her
with
a
smile
talked
to
her
about
her
native
land
.
when
he
saw
the
pretty
little
bourienne
anatole
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
would
not
find
bald
hills
dull
either
.
notatall
bad
he
thought
examining
her
not
at
all
bad
that
little
companion
i
hope
she
will
bring
her
along
with
her
when
were
married

the
old
prince
dressed
leisurely
in
his
study
frowning
and
considering
what
he
was
to
do
.
the
coming
of
these
visitors
annoyed
him
.
what
are
prince
vasili
and
that
son
of
his
to
me
prince
vasili
is
a
shallow
braggart
and
his
son
no
doubt
is
a
fine
specimen
he
grumbled
to
himself
.
what
angered
him
was
that
the
coming
of
these
visitors
revived
in
his
mind
an
unsettled
question
he
always
tried
to
stifle
one
about
which
he
always
deceived
himself
.
the
question
was
whether
he
could
ever
bring
him
self
to
part
from
his
daughter
and
give
her
to
a
husband
.
the
prince
never
directly
asked
himself
that
question
knowing
beforehand
that
he
would
have
to
answer
it
justly
and
jus
tice
clashed
not
only
with
his
feelings
but
with
the
very
possibility
of
life
.
life
without
prin
cess
mary
little
as
he
seemed
to
value
her
was
unthinkable
to
him
.
and
why
should
she
marry
he
thought
.
to
be
unhappy
for
cer
tain
.
theres
lise

to
andrew
a

think

connections
and

.
are
there
no
women
living
unmarried
and
even
the
happier
for
it
so
thought
prince
bolk6nski
while
dressing
and
yet
the
question
he
was
always
putting
off
demanded
an
immediate
answer
.
prince
vasfli
had
brought
his
son
with
the
evident
inten
tion
of
proposing
and
today
or
tomorrow
he
would
probably
ask
for
an
answer
.
his
birth
and
position
in
society
were
not
bad
.
well
ive
nothing
against
it
the
prince
said
to
him
self
but
he
must
be
worthy
of
her
.
and
that
is
what
we
shall
see
.
that
is
what
we
shall
see
that
is
what
we

he
added
aloud
.
he
entered
the
drawing
room
with
his
usual
alert
step
glancing
rapidly
round
the
com
pany
.
he
noticed
the
change
in
the
little
prin
cess
dress
mademoiselle
bouriennes
ribbon
princess
marys
unbecoming
coiffure
made
moiselle
bouriennes
and
anatoles
smiles
and
the
loneliness
of
his
daughter
amid
the
general
conversation
.
got
herself
up
like
a
fool
he
thought
looking
irritably
at
her
.
she
is
shame
less
and
he
ignores
her
he
went
straight
up
to
prince
vasili
.
well
how
dye
do
how
dye
do
glad
to
see
you
friendship
laughs
at
distance
began
prince
vasfli
in
his
usual
rapid
selfconfident
familiar
tone
.
here
is
my
second
son
please
love
and
befriend
him
.
prince
bolk6nski
surveyed
anatole
.
fine
young
fellow
fine
young
fellow
he
said
.
well
come
and
kiss
me
and
he
offered
his
cheek
.
anatole
kissed
the
old
man
and
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
and
perfect
composure
waiting
for
a
display
of
the
eccentricities
his
father
had
told
him
to
expect
.
prince
bolk6nski
sat
down
in
his
usual
place
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
and
drawing
up
an
armchair
for
prince
vasili
pointed
to
it
and
began
questioning
him
about
political
affairs
and
news
.
he
seemed
to
listen
attentively
to
what
prince
vasfli
said
but
kept
glancing
at
princess
mary
.
and
so
they
are
writing
from
potsdam
al
ready
he
said
repeating
prince
vasflis
last
words
.
then
rising
he
suddenly
went
up
to
his
daughter
.
is
it
for
visitors
youve
got
yourself
up
like
that
eh
said
he
.
fine
very
fine
you
have
done
up
your
hair
in
this
new
way
for
the
visi
tors
and
before
the
visitors
i
tell
you
that
in
future
you
are
never
to
dare
to
change
your
way
of
dress
without
my
consent
.
it
was
my
fault
mon
pkre
interceded
the
little
princess
with
a
blush
.
you
must
do
as
you
please
said
prince
bolk6nski
bowing
to
his
daughterinlaw
but
she
need
not
make
a
fool
of
herself
shes
plain
enough
as
it
is
.
and
he
sat
down
again
paying
no
more
at
tention
to
his
daughter
who
was
reduced
to
tears
.
on
the
contrary
that
coiffure
suits
the
princess
very
well
said
prince
vasfli
.
now
you
young
prince
whats
your
name
said
prince
bolk6nski
turning
to
anatole
come
here
let
us
talk
and
get
acquainted
.
now
the
fun
begins
thought
anatole
sit
ting
down
with
a
smile
beside
the
old
prince
.
well

dear
boy

edu
cated

the

scrutinizing

and
intently
.

said
anatole
hardly
able
to
restrain
his
laugh
ter
.

.

boy

turning

with
a
laugh
.

to

prince

and
anatole
laughed
still
louder
.
sud
denly
prince
bolk6nski
frowned
.

he
said
to
anatole
.
anatole
returned
smiling
to
the
ladies
.
and
so
youve
had
him
educated
abroad
prince
vasfli
havent
you
said
the
old
prince
to
prince
vasfli
.
i

my
best
for
him
and
i
can

.
he
took
prince
vasflis
arm
and
led
him
to
his
study
.
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
together
prince
vasfli
announced
his
hopes
and
wishes
to
the
old
prince
.
well
do
you
think
i
shall
prevent
her
that

cant

the
old
prince
snorted
.
let
her
marry
its
all
the
same
to
me
he
screamed
in
the
same
piercing
tone
as
when
parting
from
his
son
.
i
will
tell
you
frankly
said
prince
vasili
in
the
tone
of
a
crafty
man
convinced
of
the
futility
of
being
cunning
with
so
keensighted
a
companion
.
you
know
you
see
right
through
people
.
anatole
is
no
genius
but
he
is
an
hon
est
goodhearted
lad
an
excellent
son
or
kins
man
.
all
right
all
right
well
seel
as
always
happens
when
women
lead
lonely
lives
for
any
length
of
time
without
male
soci
ety
on
anatoles
appearance
all
the
three
wom
en
of
prince
bolk6nskis
household
felt
that
their
life
had
not
been
real
till
then
.
their
powers
of
reasoning
feeling
and
observing
immediately
increased
tenfold
and
their
life
which
seemed
to
have
been
passed
in
darkness
was
suddenly
lit
up
by
a
new
brightness
full
of
significance
.
princess
mary
grew
quite
unconscious
of
her
face
and
coiffure
.
the
handsome
open
face
of
the
man
who
might
perhaps
be
her
husband
absorbed
all
her
attention
.
he
seemed
to
her
kind
brave
determined
manly
and
magnani
mous
.
she
felt
convinced
of
that
.
thousands
of
dreams
of
a
future
family
life
continually
rose
in
her
imagination
.
she
drove
them
away
and
tried
to
conceal
them
.
but
am
i
not
too
cold
with
him
thought
the
princess
.
i
try
to
be
reserved
because
in
the
depth
of
my
soul
i
feel
too
near
to
him
al
ready
but
then
he
cannot
know
what
i
think
of
him
and
may
imagine
that
i
do
not
like
him
.
and
princess
mary
tried
but
could
not
man
age
to
be
cordial
to
her
new
guest
.
poor
girl
shes
devilish
ugly
thought
anatole
.
mademoiselle
bourienne
also
roused
to
great
excitement
by
anatoles
arrival
thought
in
another
way
.
of
course
she
a
handsome
young
woman
without
any
definite
position
without
relations
or
even
a
country
did
not
in
tend
to
devote
her
life
to
serving
prince
bol
k6nski
to
reading
aloud
to
him
and
being
friends
with
princess
mary
.
mademoiselle
bourienne
had
long
been
waiting
for
a
rus
sian
prince
who
able
to
appreciate
at
a
glance
her
superiority
to
the
plain
badly
dressed
un
gainly
russian
princesses
would
fall
in
love
with
her
and
carry
her
off
and
here
at
last
was
a
russian
prince
.
mademoiselle
bourienne
knew
a
story
heard
from
her
aunt
but
finished
in
her
own
way
which
she
liked
to
repeat
to
herself
.
it
was
the
story
of
a
girl
who
had
been
seduced
and
to
whom
her
poor
mother
sa
pauvre
mtre
appeared
and
reproached
her
for
yielding
to
a
man
without
being
married
.
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
often
touched
to
tears
as
in
imagination
she
told
this
story
to
him
her
seducer
.
and
now
he
a
real
russian
prince
had
appeared
.
he
would
carry
her
away
and
then
sa
pauvre
mtre
would
appear
and
he
would
marry
her
.
so
her
future
shaped
itself
in
mademoiselle
bouriennes
head
at
the
very
time
she
was
talking
to
anatole
about
paris
.
it
was
not
calculation
that
guided
her
she
did
not
even
for
a
moment
consider
what
she
should
do
but
all
this
had
long
been
famil
iar
to
her
and
now
that
anatole
had
appeared
it
just
grouped
itself
around
him
and
she
wished
and
tried
to
please
him
as
much
as
pos
sible
.
the
little
princess
like
an
old
war
horse
that
hears
the
trumpet
unconsciously
and
quite
forgetting
her
condition
prepared
for
the
fa
miliar
gallop
of
coquetry
without
any
ulterior
motive
or
any
struggle
but
with
naive
and
lighthearted
gaiety
.
although
in
female
society
anatole
usually
assumed
the
role
of
a
man
tired
of
being
run
after
by
women
his
vanity
was
flattered
by
the
spectacle
of
his
power
over
these
three
women
.
besides
that
he
was
beginning
to
feel
for
the
pretty
and
provocative
mademoiselle
bouri
enne
that
passionate
animal
feeling
which
was
apt
to
master
him
with
great
suddenness
and
prompt
him
to
the
coarsest
and
most
reckless
actions
.
after
tea
the
company
went
into
the
sitting
room
and
princess
mary
was
asked
to
play
on
the
clavichord
.
anatole
laughing
and
in
high
spirits
came
and
leaned
on
his
elbows
facing
her
and
beside
mademoiselle
bourienne
.
prin
cess
mary
felt
his
look
with
a
painfully
joy
ous
emotion
.
her
favorite
sonata
bore
her
in
to
a
most
intimately
poetic
world
and
the
look
she
felt
upon
her
made
that
world
still
more
poetic
.
but
anatoles
expression
though
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
referred
not
to
her
but
to
the
movements
of
mademoiselle
bouriennes
little
foot
which
he
was
.
then
touching
with
his
own
under
the
clavichord
.
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
also
look
ing
at
princess
mary
and
in
her
lovely
eyes
there
was
a
look
of
fearful
joy
and
hope
126
war
and
peace
that
was
also
new
to
the
princess
.
how
she
loves
me
i
thought
princess
mary
.
how
happy
i
am
now
and
how
happy
i
may
be
with
such
a
friend
and
such
a
husband
husband
can
it
be
possible
she
thought
not
daring
to
look
at
his
face
but
still
feeling
his
eyes
gazing
at
her
.
in
the
evening
after
supper
when
all
were
about
to
retire
anatole
kissed
princess
marys
hand
.
she
did
not
know
how
she
found
the
courage
but
she
looked
straight
into
his
hand
some
face
as
it
came
near
to
her
shortsighted
eyes
.
turning
from
princess
mary
he
went
up
and
kissed
mademoiselle
bouriennes
hand
.
this
was
not
etiquette
but
then
he
did
every
thing
so
simply
and
with
such
assurancel
mademoiselle
bourienne
flushed
and
gave
the
princess
a
frightened
look
.
what
delicacy
thought
the
princess
.
is
it
possible
that
amdlie
mademoiselle
bouri
enne
thinks
i
could
be
jealous
of
her
and
not
value
her
pure
affection
and
devotion
to
me
she
went
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
warm
ly
.
anatole
went
up
to
kiss
the
little
princess
hand
.
no
no
no
when
your
father
writfes
to
tell
me
that
you
are
behaving
well
i
will
give
you
my
hand
to
kiss
.
not
till
then
she
said
.
and
smilingly
raising
a
finger
at
him
she
left
the
room
.
chapter
v
they
all
separated
but
except
anatole
who
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
he
got
into
bed
all
kept
awake
a
long
time
that
night
.
is
he
really
to
be
my
husband
this
stranger
who
is
so
kind
yes
kind
that
is
the
chief
thing
thought
princess
mary
and
fear
which
she
had
seldom
experienced
came
upon
her
.
she
feared
to
look
round
it
seemed
to
her
that
someone
was
there
standing
behind
the
screen
in
the
dark
corner
.
and
this
someone
was
he
the
devil
and
he
was
also
this
man
with
the
white
forehead
black
eyebrows
and
red
lips
.
she
rang
for
her
maid
and
asked
her
to
sleep
in
her
room
.
mademoiselle
bourienne
walked
up
and
down
the
conservatory
for
a
long
time
that
eve
ning
vainly
expecting
someone
now
smiling
at
someone
now
working
herself
up
to
tears
with
the
imaginary
words
of
her
pauvre
mere
rebuking
her
for
her
fall
.
the
ijtle
princess
grumbled
to
her
maid
that
her
bed
was
badly
made
.
she
could
not
lie
either
on
her
face
or
on
her
side
.
every
posi
tion
was
awkward
and
uncomfortable
and
her
burden
oppressed
her
now
more
than
ever
be
cause
anatoles
presence
had
vividly
recalled
to
her
the
time
when
she
was
not
like
that
and
when
everything
was
light
and
gay
.
she
sat
in
an
armchair
in
her
dressing
jacket
and
night
cap
and
katie
sleepy
and
disheveled
beat
and
turned
the
heavy
feather
bed
for
the
third
time
muttering
to
herself
.
i
told
you
it
was
all
lumps
and
holes
the
little
princess
repeated
.
i
should
be
glad
enough
to
fall
asleep
so
its
not
my
fault
and
her
voice
quivered
like
that
of
a
child
about
to
cry
.
the
old
prince
did
not
sleep
either
.
tikhon
half
asleep
heard
him
pacing
angrily
about
and
snorting
.
the
old
prince
felt
as
though
he
had
been
insulted
through
his
daughter
.
the
insult
was
the
more
pointed
because
it
con
cerned
not
himself
but
another
his
daughter
whom
he
loved
more
than
himself
.
he
kept
telling
himself
that
he
would
consider
the
whole
matter
and
decide
what
was
right
and
how
he
should
act
but
instead
of
that
he
only
excited
himself
more
and
more
.
the
first
man
that
turns
up
she
forgets
her
father
and
everything
else
runs
upstairs
and
does
up
her
hair
and
wags
her
tail
and
is
unlike
herself
glad
to
throw
her
father
over
and
she
knew
i
should
notice
it

and
dont
i
see
that
that
idiot
had
eyes
only
for
bourienne
i
shall
have
to
get
rid
of
her
.
and
how
is
it
she
has
not
pride
enough
to
see
it
if
she
has
no
pride
for
herself
she
might
at
least
have
some
for
my
sake
she
must
be
shown
that
the
blockhead
thinks
nothing
of
her
and
looks
only
at
bourienne
.
no
she
has
no
pride

.

.

but
ill
let
her
see
.

.
the
old
prince
knew
that
if
he
told
his
daughter
she
was
making
a
mistake
and
that
ana
tole
meant
to
flirt
with
mademoiselle
bouri
enne
princess
marys
selfesteem
would
be
wounded
and
his
point
not
to
be
parted
from
her
would
be
gained
so
pacifying
himself
with
this
thought
he
called
tikhon
and
began
to
undress
.
what
devil
brought
them
here
thought
he
while
tikhon
was
putting
the
nightshirt
over
his
driedup
old
body
and
grayhaired
chest
.
i
never
invited
them
.
they
came
to
dis
turb
my
life
and
there
is
not
much
of
it
left
.
devil
takeem
he
muttered
while
his
head
was
still
covered
by
the
shirt
.
tikhon
knew
his
masters
habit
of
some
times
thinking
aloud
and
therefore
met
with
unaltered
looks
the
angrily
inquisitive
expres
sion
of
the
face
that
emerged
from
the
shirt
.
book

gone

asked
the
prince
.
tikhon
like
all
good
valets
instinctively
knew
the
direction
of
his
masters
thoughts
.
he
guessed
that
the
question
referred
to
prince
vasfli
and
his
son
.
they
have
gone
to
bed
and
put
out
their
lights
your
excellency
.

said
the
prince
rapidly
and
thrusting
his
feet
into
his
slippers
and
his
arms
into
the
sleeves
of
his
dressing
gown
he
went
to
the
couch
on
which
he
slept
.
though
no
words
had
passed
between
ana
tole
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
they
quite
understood
one
another
as
to
the
first
part
of
their
romance
up
to
the
appearance
of
the
pauvre
mere
they
understood
that
they
had
much
to
say
to
one
another
in
private
and
so
they
had
been
seeking
an
opportunity
since
morning
to
meet
one
another
alone
.
when
princess
mary
went
to
her
fathers
room
at
the
usual
hour
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
ana
tole
met
in
the
conservatory
.
princess
mary
went
to
the
door
of
the
study
with
special
trepidation
.
it
seemed
to
her
that
not
only
did
everybody
know
that
her
fate
would
be
decided
that
day
but
that
they
also
knew
what
she
thought
about
it
.
she
read
this
in
tikhons
face
and
in
that
of
prince
vasilis
valet
who
made
her
a
low
bow
when
she
met
him
in
the
corridor
carrying
hot
water
.
the
old
prince
was
very
affectionate
and
careful
in
his
treatment
of
his
daughter
that
morning
.
princess
mary
well
knew
this
pains
taking
expression
of
her
fathers
.
his
face
wore
that
expression
when
his
dry
hands
clenched
with
vexation
at
her
not
understanding
a
sum
in
arithmetic
when
rising
from
his
chair
he
would
walk
away
from
her
repeating
in
a
low
voice
the
same
words
several
times
over
.
he
came
to
the
point
at
once
treating
her
ceremoniously
.
i
have
had
a
proposition
made
me
concern
ing
you
he
said
with
an
unnatural
smile
.
i
expect
you
have
guessed
that
prince
vasili
has
not
come
and
brought
his
pupil
with
him
for
some
reason
prince
bolktinski
referred
to
anatole
as
a
pupil
for
the
sake
of
my
beau
tiful
eyes
.
last
night
a
proposition
was
made
me
on
your
account
and
as
you
know
my
prin
ciples
i
refer
it
to
you
.
how
am
i
to
understand
you
man
perel
said
the
princess
growing
pale
and
then
blush
ing
.
how
understand
me
cried
her
father
an
grily
.
prince
vasfli
finds
you
to
his
taste
as
a
daughterinlaw
and
makes
a
proposal
to
you
on
his
pupils
behalf
.
thats
how
its
to
be
un
derstood
1
how
understand
it

..
.
and
i
ask
you
i
do
not
know
what
you
think
father
whispered
the
princess
.
i
i
what
of
me
leave
me
out
of
the
question
.
im
not
going
to
get
married
.
what
about
you
thats
what
i
want
to
know
.
the
princess
saw
that
her
father
regarded
the
matter
with
disapproval
but
at
that
mo
ment
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
her
fate
would
be
decided
now
or
never
.
she
lowered
her
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
the
gaze
under
which
she
felt
that
she
could
not
think
but
would
only
be
able
to
submit
from
habit
and
she
said
i
wish
only
to
do
your
will
but
if
i
had
to
express
my
own
desire

.

.

.
she
had
no
time
to
finish
.
the
old
prince
interrupted
her
.
thats
admirable
he
shouted
.
he
will
take
you
with
your
dowry
and
take
mademoi
selle
bourienne
into
the
bargain

the
wife
while

.
the
prince
stopped
.
he
saw
the
effect
these
words
had
produced
on
his
daughter
.
she
low
ered
her
head
and
was
ready
to
burst
into
tears
.
now
then
now
then
im
only
joking
he
said
.

this
princess
i
hold
to
the
principle
that
a
maiden
has
a
full
right
to
choose

i
give

..
.
go
to
your
room
think
it
over
and
come
back
in
an
hour
and
tell
me
in
his
presence

go
yes
or
no
yes
or
no
yes
or
no
he
still
shouted
when
the
princess
as
if
lost
in
a
fog
had
already
staggered
out
of
the
study
.
her
fate
was
decided
and
happily
decided
.
but
what
her
father
had
said
about
mademoi
selle
bourienne
was
dreadful
.
it
was
untrue
to
be
sure
but
still
it
was
terrible
and
she
could
not
help
thinking
of
it
.
she
was
going
straight
on
through
the
conservatory
neither
seeing
nor
hearing
anything
when
suddenly
the
well
known
whisperingof
mademoiselle
bourienne
aroused
her
.
she
raised
her
eyes
and
two
steps
away
saw
anatole
embracing
the
frenchwom
an
and
whispering
something
to
her
.
with
a
horrified
expression
on
his
handsome
face
an
atole
looked
at
princess
mary
but
did
not
at
once
take
his
arm
from
the
waist

not

whos

moment
ana

face
seemed
to
say
.
princess
mary
looked
at
them
in
silence
.
she
could
not
understand
it
.
at
last
mademoiselle
bourienne
gave
a
scream
and
ran
away
.
anatole
bowed
to
prin
cess
mary
with
a
gay
smile
as
if
inviting
her
to
join
in
a
laugh
at
this
strange
incident
and
then
shrugging
his
shoulders
went
to
the
door
that
led
to
his
own
apartments
.
an
hour
later
tikhon
came
to
call
princess
mary
to
the
old
prince
he
added
that
prince
vasiii
was
also
there
.
when
tikhon
came
to
her
princess
mary
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
her
room
holding
the
weeping
mademoiselle
bourienne
in
her
arms
and
gently
stroking
her
hair
.
the
princess
beautiful
eyes
with
all
their
former
calm
radiance
were
looking
with
tend
er
affection
and
pity
at
mademoiselle
bouri
ennes
pretty
face
.
no

lost
your
affection

said
mademoiselle
bourienne
.

i
will
try
to
do

not

was
the
count
at

handed
a
letter
addressed
in
his

hand
writing

on
receiving
it
he
ran
on

to
his

closed

began

in

on

of

arrival
of

went
softly
into

the
count
with
it
in

sobbing

laughing

anna
mikhaylovna
sat
down
beside
him
with
her
own
handkerchief
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
and
from
the
letter
then
having
dried
her
own
eyes
she
comforted
the
count
and
decided
that
at
dinner
and
till
teatime
she
would
pre
pare
the
countess
and
after
tea
with
gods
help
would
inform
her
.
at
dinner
anna
mikhaylovna
talked
the
whole
time
about
the
war
news
and
about
ni
k61enka
twice
asked
when
the
last
letter
had
been
received
from
him
though
she
knew
that
already
and
remarked
that
they
might
very
likely
be
getting
a
letter
from
him
that
day
.
each
time
that
these
hints
began
to
make
the
countess
anxious
and
she
glanced
uneasily
at
the
count
and
at
anna
mikhaylovna
the
lat
ter
very
adroitly
turned
the
conversation
to
in
significant
matters
.
natasha
who
of
the
whole
family
was
the
most
gifted
with
a
capacity
to
feel
any
shades
of
intonation
look
and
ex
pression
pricked
up
her
ears
from
the
begin
ning
of
the
meal
and
was
certain
that
there
was
some
secret
between
her
father
and
anna
mikhayvna
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
her
brotuer
and
that
anna
mikhiylovna
was
preparing
them
for
it
.
bold
as
she
was
nata

who
knew
how
sensitive
her
mother
was
to
anything
relating
to
nik61enkadid
not
ven
ture
to
ask
any
questions
at
dinner
but
she
was
too
excited
to
eat
anything
and
kept
wrig
gling
about
on
her
chair
regardless
of
her
gov
erness
remarks
.
after
dinner
she
rushed
head
long
after
anna
mikhdylovna
and
dashing
at
her
flung
herself
on
her
neck
as
soon
as
she
overtook
her
in
the
sitting
room
.

said

a

reading

in

told

instantly
turning

natasha
seeing
the
impression
the
news
of
her
brothers
wound
produced
on
s6nya
felt
for
the
first
time
the
sorrowful
side
of
the
news
.
she
rushed
to
s6nya
hugged
her
and
began
to
cry
.
a
little
wound
but
he
has
been
made
an
officer
he
is
well
now
he

said
she
through
her
tears
.
there
now
its
true
that
all

remarked
petya
pacing
the

with
large
resolute

now
im

very

natasha
smiled
through
her
tears

no

she
said
that
it
was
all
over
and
that
hes
now
an
officer
.
thank

said
s6nya
crossing
herself
.
but
perhaps
she
deceived
you

asked
after

s6nya
smiled

that

evidently
wishing

give

a

.

.
no
she
shut
her
eyes
.
no
theres
nothing
at
all
.
oh
natdsha
said
s6nya
looking
ecstati
cally
and
earnestly
at
her
friend
as
if
she
did
ot
consider
her
worthy
to
hear
what
she
meant

say
and
as
if
she
were
saying
it
to
someone
ise
with
whom
joking
was
out
of
the
ques
on
i
am
in
love
with
your
brother
once
for
11
and
whatever
may
happen
to
him
or
to
me
hall
never
cease
to
love
him
as
long
as
i
live
.
natdsha
looked
at
s6nya
with
wondering
nd
inquisitive
eyes
and
said
nothing
.
she
felt
lat
sonya
was
speaking
the
truth
that
there
ras
such
love
as
s6nya
was
speaking
of
.
but

jatdsha
had
not
yet
felt
anything
like
it
.
she
believed
it
could
be
but
did
not
understand
it
.
shall
you
write
to
him
she
asked
.
s6nya
became
thoughtful
.
the
question
of
how
to
write
to
nicholas
and
whether
she
ought
to
write
tormented
her
.
now
that
he
was
already
an
officer
and
a
wounded
hero
would
it
be
right
to
remind
him
of
herself
and
as
it
might
seem
of
the
obligations
to
her
he
had
taken
on
himself
i
dont
know
.
i
think
if
he
writes
i
will
write
too
she
said
blushing
.
and
you
wont
feel
ashamed
to
write
to
him
s6nya
smiled
.
no
.
and
i
should
be
ashamed
to
write
to
boris
.
im
not
going
to
.
why
should
you
be
ashamed
well
i
dont
know
.
its
awkward
and
would
make
me
ashamed
.
and
i
know
why
shed
be
ashamed
said
petya
offended
by
natashas
previous
remark
.
its
because
she
was
in
love
with
that
fat
one
in
spectacles
that
was
how
ptya
described
his
namesake
the
new
count
bezukhov
and
now
shes
in
love
with
that
singer
he
meant
natdshas
italian
singing
master
thats
why
shes
ashamed
ptya
youre
a
stupid
said
natdsha
.
not
more
stupid
than
you
madam
said
the
nineyearold
ptya
with
the
air
of
an
old
brigadier
.
the
countess
had
been
prepared
by
anna
mikhdylovnas
hints
at
dinner
.
on
retiring
to
her
own
room
she
sat
in
an
armchair
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
miniature
portrait
of
her
son
on
the
lid
of
a
snuffbox
while
the
tears
kept
coming
into
her
eyes
.
anna
mikhdylovna
with
the
let
ter
came
on
tiptoe
to
the
countess
door
and
paused
.
dont
come
in
she
said
to
the
old
count
who
was
following
her
come
later
.
and
she
went
in
closing
the
door
behind
her
.
the
count
put
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
and
lis
tened
.
at
first
he
heard
the
sound
of
indifferent
voices
then
anna
mikhdylovnas
voice
alone
in
a
long
speech
then
a
cry
then
silence
then
both
voices
together
with
glad
intonations
and
then
footsteps
.
anna
mikhdylovna
opened
the
door
.
her
face
wore
the
proud
expression
of
a
surgeon
who
has
just
performed
a
difficult
operation
and
admits
the
public
to
appreciate
his
skill
.
it
is
donel
she
said
to
the
count
pointing
triumphantly
to
the
countess
who
sat
holding
in
one
hand
the
snuffbox
with
its
portrait
and
in
the
other
the
letter
and
pressing
them
al
ternately
to
her
lips
.
when
she
saw
the
count
she
stretched
out
her
arms
to
him
embraced
his
bald
head
over
which
she
again
looked
at
the
letter
and
the
portrait
and
in
order
to
press
them
again
to
her
lips
she
slightly
pushed
away
the
bald
head
.
vea
natasha
s6nya
and
ptya
now
en
tered
the
room
and
the
reading
of
the
letter
began
.
after
a
brief
description
of
the
cam
paign
and
the
two
battles
in
which
he
had
tak
en
part
and
his
promotion
nicholas
said
that
he
kissed
his
fathers
and
mothers
hands
ask
ing
for
their
blessing
and
that
he
kissed
vra
natdsha
and
pihya
.
besides
that
he
sent
greet
ings
to
monsieur
schelling
madame
schoss
and
his
old
nurse
and
asked
them
to
kiss
for
him
dear
s6nya
whom
he
loved
and
thought
of
just
the
same
as
ever
.
when
she
heard
this
s6nya
blushed
so
that
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
unable
to
bear
the
looks
turned
upon
her
ran
away
into
the
dancing
hall
whirled
round
it
at
full
speed
with
her
dress
puffed
out
like
a
balloon
and
flushed
and
smiling
plumped
down
on
the
floor
.
the
countess
was
crying
.
why
are
you
crying
mamma
asked
vdra
.
from
all
he
says
one
should
be
glad
and
not
cry
.
this
was
quite
true
but
the
count
the
count
ess
and
natasha
looked
at
her
reproachfully
.
and
who
is
it
she
takes
after
thought
the
countess
.
nicholas
letter
was
read
over
hundreds
of
times
and
those
who
were
considered
worthy
to
hear
it
had
to
come
to
the
countess
for
she
did
not
let
it
out
of
her
hands
.
the
tutors
came
and
the
nurses
and
dmitri
and
several
ac
book
three
quaintances
and
the
countess
reread
the
letter
each
time
with
fresh
pleasure
and
each
time
discovered
in
it
fresh
proofs
of
nik61enkas
vir
tues
.
how
strange
how
extraordinary
how
joy
ful
it
seemed
that
her
son
the
scarcely
per
ceptible
motion
of
whose
tiny
limbs
she
had
felt
twenty
years
ago
within
her
that
son
about
whom
she
used
to
have
quarrels
with
the
too
indulgent
count
that
son
who
had
first
learned
to
say
pear
and
then
granny
that
this
son
should
now
be
away
in
a
foreign
land
amid
strange
surroundings
a
manly
warrior
doing
some
kind
of
mans
work
of
his
own
without
help
or
guidance
.
the
universal
experience
of
ages
showing
that
children
do
grow
impercep
tibly
from
the
cradle
to
manhood
did
not
exist
for
the
countess
.
her
sons
growth
toward
man
hood
at
each
of
its
stages
had
seemed
as
extra
ordinary
to
her
as
if
there
had
never
existed
the
millions
of
human
beings
who
grew
up
in
the
same
way
.
as
twenty
years
before
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
little
creature
who
lived
somewhere
under
her
heart
would
ever
cry
suck
her
breast
and
begin
to
speak
so
now
she
could
not
believe
that
that
little
creature
could
be
this
strong
brave
man
this
model
son
and
officer
that
judging
by
this
letter
he
now
was
.

for
more
than
a
week
preparations
were
be
ing
made
rough
drafts
of
letters
to
nicholas
from
all
the
household
were
written
and
copied
out
while
under
the
supervision
of
the
count
ess
and
the
solicitude
of
the
count
money
and
all
things
necessary
for
the
uniform
and
equip
ment
of
the
newly
commissioned
officer
were
collected
.
anna
mikhaylovna
practical
wom
an
that
she
was
had
even
managed
by
favor
with
army
authorities
to
secure
advantageous
means
of
communication
for
herself
and
her
son

.
she
had
opportunities
of
sending
her
letters
to
the
grand
duke
constan
tine
pdvlovich
who
commanded
the
guards
.
the
rost6vs
supposed
that
the
russian
guards
a
broad
was
quite
a
definite
address
and
that
if
a
letter
reached
the
grand
duke
in
command
of
the
guards
there
was
no
reason
why
it
should
not
reach
the
pavlograd
regiment
which
was
presuma
bly
somewhere
in
the
same
neighborhood
.
and
so
it
was
decided
to
send
the
letters
and
money
by
the
grand
dukes
courier
to
boris
and
boris
was
to
forward
them
to
nicholas
.
the
letters
were
from
the
old
count
the
countess
ptya
vera
natasha
and
s6nya
and
finally
there
were
six
thousand
rubles
for
his
outfit
and
vari
ous
other
things
the
old
count
sent
to
his
son
.
chapter
vii
on
the
twelfth
of
november
kutiizovs
active
army
in
camp
before
olmiitz
was
preparing
to
be
reviewed
next
day
by
the
two
emperors
the
russian
and
the
austrian
.
the
guards
just
arrived
from
russia
spent
the
night
ten
miles
from
olmiitz
and
next
morning
were
to
come
straight
to
the
review
reaching
the
field
at
olmiitz
by
ten
oclock
.
that
day
nicholas
rost6v
received
a
letter
from
borfs
telling
him
that
the
ismaylov
regi
ment
was
quartered
for
the
night
ten
miles
from
olmiitz
and
that
he
wanted
to
see
him
as
he
had
a
letter
and
money
for
him
.
rostov
was
particularly
in
need
of
money
now
that
the
troops
after
their
active
service
were
stationed
near
olmiitz
and
the
camp
swarmed
with
well
provisioned
sutlers
and
austrian
jews
offering
all
sorts
of
tempting
wares
.
the
pavlograds
held
feast
after
feast
celebrating
awards
they
had
received
for
the
campaign
and
made
ex
peditions
to
olmiitz
to
visit
a
certain
caroline
the
hungarian
who
had
recently
opened
ares
taurant
there
with
girls
as
waitresses
.
rost6v
who
had
just
celebrated
his
promotion
to
a
cornetcy
and
bought
denfsovs
horse
bedouin
was
in
debt
all
round
to
his
comrades
and
the
sutlers
.
on
receiving
boris
letter
he
rode
with
a
fellow
officer
to
olmiitz
dined
there
drank
a
bottle
of
wine
and
then
set
off
alone
to
the
guards
camp
to
find
his
old
playmate
.
rost6v
had
not
yet
had
time
to
get
his
uniform
.
he
had
on
a
shabby
cadet
jacket
decorated
with
a
soldiers
cross
equally
shabby
cadets
riding
breeches
lined
with
worn
leather
and
an
of
ficers
saber
with
a
sword
knot
.
the
don
horse
he
was
riding
was
one
he
had
bought
from
a
cossack
during
the
campaign
and
he
wore
a
crumpled
hussar
cap
stuck
jauntily
back
on
one
side
of
his
head
.
as
he
rode
up
to
the
camp
he
thought
how
he
would
impress
borfs
and
all
his
comrades
of
the
guards
by
his
appearance
that
of
a
fighting
hussar
who
had
been
under
fire
.
the
guards
had
made
their
whole
march
as
if
on
a
pleasure
trip
parading
their
cleanli
ness
and
discipline
.
they
had
come
by
easy
war
and
peace
stages
their
knapsacks
conveyed
on
carts
and
the
austrian
authorities
had
provided
excel
lent
dinners
for
the
officers
at
every
halting
place
.
the
regiments
had
entered
and
left
the
town
with
their
bands
playing
and
by
the
grand
dukes
orders
the
men
had
marched
all
the
way
instep
a
practice
on
which
the
guards
prided
themselves
the
officers
on
foot
and
at
their
proper
posts
.
boris
had
been
quartered
and
had
marched
all
the
way
with
berg
who
was
already
in
command
of
a
company
.
berg
who
had
obtained
his
captaincy
during
the
campaign
had
gained
the
confidence
of
his
superiors
by
his
promptitude
and
accuracy
and
had
arranged
his
money
matters
very
satisfac
torily
.
boris
during
the
campaign
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
many
persons
who
might
prove
useful
to
him
and
by
a
letter
of
recom
mendation
he
had
brought
from
pierre
had
be
come
acquainted
with
prince
andrew
bolk6n
ski
through
whom
he
hoped
to
obtain
a
post
on
the
commander
in
chiefs
staff
.
berg
and
boris
having
rested
after
yesterdays
march
were
sitting
clean
and
neatly
dressed
at
a
round
table
in
the
clean
quarters
allotted
to
them
playing
chess
.
berg
held
a
smoking
pipe
between
his
knees
.
boris
in
the
accurate
way
characteristic
of
him
was
building
a
little
pyra
mid
of
chessmen
with
his
delicate
white
fingers
while
awaiting
bergs
move
and
watched
his
opponents
face
evidently
thinking
about
the
game
as
he
always
thought
only
of
whatever
he
was
engaged
on
.
well
how
are
you
going
to
get
out
of
that
he
remarked
.
well
try
to
replied
berg
touching
a
pawn
and
then
removing
his
hand
.
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
.
here
he
is
at
last
shouted
rost6v
.
and
berg
too
oh
you
petisenfans
allay
cushay
dormir

he
exclaimed
imitating
his
russian
nurses
french
at
which
he
and
boris
used
to
laugh
long
ago
.
dear
me
how
you
have
changed
boris
rose
to
meet
rost6v
but
in
doing
so
did
not
omit
to
steady
and
replace
some
chess
men
that
were
falling
.
he
was
about
to
em
brace
his
friend
but
nicholas
avoided
him
.
with
that
peculiar
feeling
of
youth
that
dread
of
beaten
tracks
and
wish
to
express
itself
in
a
manner
different
from
that
of
its
elders
which
is
often
insincere
nicholas
wished
to
do
some
thing
special
on
meeting
his
friend
.
he
wanted
to
pinch
him
push
him
do
anything
but
kiss
hima
thing
everybody
did
.
but
notwithstand
1
little
children
go
to

and
sleep
.tr
.
ing
this
boris
embraced
him
in
a
quiet
friend
ly
way
and
kissed
him
three
times
.
they
had
not
met
for
nearly
half
a
year
and
being
at
the
age
when
young
men
take
their
first
steps
on
lifes
road
each
saw
immense
changes
in
the
other
quite
a
new
reflection
of
the
society
in
which
they
had
taken
those
first
steps
.
both
had
changed
greatly
since
they
last
met
and
both
were
in
a
hurry
to
show
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
in
them
.
oh
you
damned
dandies
clean
and
fresh
as
if
youd
been
to
a
fete
not
like
us
sinners
of
the
line
cried
rost6v
with
martial
swagger
and
with
baritone
notes
in
his
voice
new
to
boris
pointing
to
his
own
mudbespattered
breeches
.
the
german
landlady
hearing
ros
tovs
loud
voice
popped
her
head
in
at
the
door
.
eh
is
she
pretty
he
asked
with
a
wink
.
why
do
you
shout
so
youll
frighten
them


said
boris
.
i
did
not
expect
you
today
he
added
.
i
only
sent
you
the
note
yesterday
by
bolk6nski
an
adjutant
of
kutuzovs
whos
a
friend
of
mine
.
i
did
not
think
he
would
get
it
to
you
so
quickly
well
how
are
you
been
under
fire
already
asked
boris
.
without
answering
rostov
shook
the
sol
diers
cross
of
st
.
george
fastened
to
the
cord
ing
of
his
uniform
and
indicating
a
bandaged
arm
glanced
at
berg
with
a
smile
.
as
you
see
he
said
.
indeed
yes
yes
said
boris
with
a
smile
.
and
we
too
have
had
a
splendid
march
.
you
know
of
course
that
his
imperial
highness
rode
with
our
regiment
all
the
time
so
that
we
had
every
comfort
and
every
advantage
.
what
receptions
we
had
in
poland
what
dinners
and
balls
i
cant
tell
you
.
and
the
tsarvich
was
very
gracious
to
all
our
officers
.
and
the
two
friends
told
each
other
of
their
doings
the
one
of
his
hussar
revels
and
life
in
the
fighting
line
the
other
of
the
pleasures
and
advantages
of
service
under
members
of
the
imperial
family
.
oh
you
guards
said
rost6v
.
i
say
send
for
some
wine
.
boris
made
a
grimace
.
if
you
really
want
it
said
he
.
he
went
to
his
bed
drew
a
purse
from
un
der
the
clean
pillow
and
sent
for
wine
.
yes
and
i
have
some
money
and
a
letter
to
give
you
he
added
.
rost6v
took
the
letter
and
throwing
the
money
on
the
sofa
put
both
arms
on
the
table
and
began
to
read
.
after
reading
a
few
lines
he
glanced
angrily
at
berg
then
meeting
his
book
three
133
eyes
hid
his
face
behind
the
letter
.
well
theyve
sent
you
a
tidy
sum
said
berg
eying
the
heavy
purse
that
sank
into
the
sofa
.
as
for
us
count
we
get
along
on
our
pay
.
i
can
tell
you
for
myself

.

.

.
i
say
berg
my
dear
fellow
said
rost6v
when
you
get
a
letter
from
home
and
meet
one
of
your
own
people
whom
you
want
to
talk
everything
over
with
and
i
happen
to
be
there
ill
go
at
once
to
be
out
of
your
way
do
go
somewhere
anywhere

..
.
to
the
devil
1
he
exclaimed
and
immediately
seizing
him
by
the
shoulder
and
looking
amiably
into
his
face
evidently
wishing
to
soften
the
rudeness
of
his
words
he
added
dont
be
hurt
my
dear
fel
low
you
know
i
speak
from
my
heart
as
to
an
old
acquaintance
.
oh
dont
mention
it
count
i
quite
un
derstand
said
berg
getting
up
and
speaking
in
a
muffled
and
guttural
voice
.
go
across
to
our
hosts
they
invited
you
added
boris
.
berg
put
on
the
cleanest
of
coats
without
a
spot
or
speck
of
dust
stood
before
a
looking
glass
and
brushed
the
hair
on
his
temples
up
wards
in
the
way
affected
by
the
emperor
alexander
and
having
assured
himself
from
the
way
rostov
looked
at
it
that
his
coat
had
been
noticed
left
the
room
with
a
pleasant
smile
.
oh
dear
what
a
beast
i
am
muttered
ros
tov
as
he
read
the
letter
.
why
oh
what
a
pig
i
am
not
to
have
written
and
to
have
given
them
such
a
fright
oh
what
a
pig
i
am
he
repeated
flushing
suddenly
.
well
have
you
sent
gabriel
for
some
wine
all
right
lets
have
some
in
the
letter
from
his
parents
was
enclosed
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
bagrati6n
which
the
old
countess
at
anna
mikhdylovnas
advice
had
obtained
through
an
acquaintance
and
sent
to
her
son
asking
him
to
take
it
to
its
des
tination
and
make
use
of
it
.
what
nonsense
much
i
need
it
said
ros
t6v
throwing
the
letter
under
the
table
.
why
have
you
thrown
that
away
asked
boris
.
it
is
some
letter
of
recommendation

.

.

.
what
the
devil
do
i
want
it
for
why
what
the
devil
said
boris
picking
it
up
and
reading
the
address
.
this
letter
would
be
of
great
use
to
you
.
i
want
nothing
and
i
wont
be
anyones
adjutant
.
why
not
inquired
boris
.
its
a
lackeys
job
you
are
still
the
same
dreamer
i
see
re
marked
boris
shaking
his
head
.
and
youre
still
the
same
diplomatist
but
thats
not
the
point
.

.

.

.
come
how
are
you
asked
rost6v
.
well
as
you
see
.
so
far
everythings
all
right
but
i
confess
i
should
much
like
to
be
an
adjutant
and
not
remain
at
the
front
.
why
because
when
once
a
man
starts
on
military
service
he
should
try
to
make
as
successful
a
career
of
it
as
possible
.
oh
thats
it
said
rost6v
evidently
think
ing
of
something
else
.
he
looked
intently
and
inquiringly
into
his
friends
eyes
evidently
trying
in
vain
to
find
the
answer
to
some
question
.
old
gabriel
brought
in
the
wine
.
shouldnt
we
now
send
for
berg
asked
boris
.
he
would
drink
with
you
.
i
cant
.
well
send
for
him

.

.

.
and
how
do
you
get
on
with
that
german
asked
rost6v
with
a
contemptuous
smile
.
he
is
a
very
very
nice
honest
and
pleasant
fellow
answered
boris
.
again
rost6v
looked
intently
into
boris
eyes
and
sighed
.
berg
returned
and
over
the
bottle
of
wine
conversation
between
the
three
officers
became
animated
.
the
guardsmen
told
rost6v
of
their
march
and
how
they
had
been
made
much
of
in
russia
poland
and
abroad
.
they
spoke
of
the
sayings
and
doings
of
their
commander
the
grand
duke
and
told
stories
of
his
kindness
and
irascibility
.
berg
as
usual
kept
silent
when
the
subject
did
not
relate
to
himself
but
in
connection
with
the
stories
of
the
grand
dukes
quick
temper
he
related
with
gusto
how
in
galicia
he
had
managed
to
deal
with
the
grand
duke
when
the
latter
made
a
tour
of
the
regiments
and
was
annoyed
at
the
irregularity
of
a
movement
.
with
a
pleasant
smile
berg
related
how
the
grand
duke
had
ridden
up
to
him
in
a
violent
passion
shout
ing
arnautsl
1
arnauts
was
the
tsare
vichs
favorite
expression
when
he
was
in
a
rage
and
called
for
the
company
commander
would
you
believe
it
count
i
was
not
at
all
alarmed
because
i
knew
i
was
right
.
with
out
boasting
you
know
i
may
say
that
i
know
the
army
orders
by
heart
and
know
the
regu
lations
as
well
as
i
do
the
lords
prayer
.
so
count
there
never
is
any
negligence
in

war
and
peace
company
and
so
my
conscience
was
at
ease
.
i
came
forward

berg
stood
up
and
showed
how
he
presented
himself
with
his
hand
to
his
cap
and
really
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
a
face
to
express
greater
respect
and
self
complacency
than
his
did
.
well
he
stormed
at
me
as
the
saying
is

andstormedand
stormed
it
was
not
a
matter
of
life
but
rather
of
death
as
the
saying
is

albanians
and
dev
ils
and
to
siberia

said
berg
with
a
saga
cious
smile
.
i
knew
i
was
in
the
right
so
i
kept
silent
was
not
that
best
count

.

.

.
hey
are
you
dumb
he
shouted
.
still
i
remained
silent
.
and
what
do
you
think
count
the
next
day
it
was
not
even
mentioned
in
the
orders
of
the
day
.
thats
what
keeping
ones
head
means
.
thats
the
way
count
said
berg
lighting
his
pipe
and
emitting
rings
of
smoke
.
yes
that
was
fine
said
rostov
smiling
.
but
boris
noticed
that
he
was
preparing
to
make
fun
of
berg
and
skillfully
changed
the
subject
.
he
asked
him
to
tell
them
how
and
where
he
got
his
wound
.
this
pleased
rost6v
and
he
began
talking
about
it
and
as
he
went
on
became
more
and
more
animated
.
he
told
them
of
his
schon
grabern
affair
just
as
those
who
have
taken
part
in
a
battle
generally
do
describe
it
that
is
as
they
would
like
it
to
have
been
as
they
have
heard
it
described
by
others
and
as
sounds
well
but
not
at
all
as
it
really
was
.
rost6v
was
a
truthful
young
man
and
would
on
no
account
have
told
a
deliberate
lie
.
he
began
his
story
meaning
to
tell
everything
just
as
it
happened
but
imperceptibly
invol
untarily
and
inevitably
he
lapsed
into
false
hood
.
if
he
had
told
the
truth
to
his
hearers
who
like
himself
had
often
heard
stories
of
at
tacks
and
had
formed
a
definite
idea
of
what
an
attack
was
and
were
expecting
to
hear
just
such
a
story
they
would
either
not
have
be
lieved
him
or
still
worse
would
have
thought
that
rostov
was
himself
to
blame
since
what
generally
happens
to
the
narrators
of
cavalry
attacks
had
not
happened
to
him
.
he
could
not
tell
them
simply
that
everyone
went
at
a
trot
and
that
he
fell
off
his
horse
and
sprained
his
arm
and
then
ran
as
hard
as
he
could
from
a
frenchman
into
the
wood
.
besides
to
tell
everything
as
it
really
happened
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
make
an
effort
of
will
to
tell
only
what
happened
.
it
is
very
difficult
to
tell
the
truth
and
young
people
are
rarely
capable
of
it
.
his
hearers
expected
a
story
of
how
be
side
himself
and
all
aflame
with
excitement
he
had
flown
like
a
storm
at
the
square
cut
his
way
in
slashed
right
and
left
how
his
saber
had
tasted
flesh
and
he
had
fallen
exhausted
and
so
on
.
and
so
he
told
them
all
that
.
in
the
middle
of
his
story
just
as
he
was
saying
you
cannot
imagine
what
a
strange
frenzy
one
experiences
duringanattackprince
andrew
whom
boris
was
expecting
entered
the
room
.
prince
andrew
who
liked
to
help
young
men
was
flattered
by
being
asked
for
his
assistance
and
being
well
disposed
toward
boris
who
had
managed
to
please
him
the
day
before
he
wished
to
do
what
the
young
man
wanted
.
having
been
sent
with
papers
from
kutiiov
to
the
tsardvich
he
looked
in
on
boris
hoping
to
find
him
alone
.
when
he
came
in
and
saw
an
hussar
of
the
line
recounting
his
military
exploits
prince
andrew
could
not
endure
that
sort
of
man
he
gave
boris
a
pleas
ant
smile
frowned
as
with
halfclosed
eyes
he
looked
at
rost6v
bowed
slightly
and
wea
rily
and
sat
down
languidly
on
the
sofa
he
felt
it
unpleasant
to
have
dropped
in
on
bad
company
.
rostov
flushed
up
on
noticing
this
but
he
did
not
care
this
was
a
mere
stran
ger
.
glancing
however
at
boris
he
saw
that
he
too
seemed
ashamed
of
the
hussar
of
the
line
.
in
spite
of
prince
andrews
disagreeable
ironical
tone
in
spite
of
the
contempt
with
which
rostov
from
his
fighting
army
point
of
view
regarded
all
these
little
adjutants
on
the
staff
of
whom
the
newcomer
was
evidently
one
rost6v
felt
confused
blushed
and
became
si
lent
.
boris
inquired
what
news
there
might
be
on
the
staff
and
what
without
indiscretion
one
might
ask
about
our
plans
.
we
shall
probably
advance
replied
bol
k6nski
evidently
reluctant
to
say
more
in
the
presence
of
a
stranger
.
berg
took
the
opportunity
to
ask
with
great
politeness
whether
as
was
rumored
the
allow
ance
of
forage
money
to
captains
of
companies
would
be
doubled
.
to
this
prince
andrew
an
swered
with
a
smile
that
he
could
give
no
opinion
on
such
an
important
government
or
der
and
berg
laughed
gaily
.
as
to
your
business
prince
andrew
con
tinued
addressing
boris
we
will
talk
of
it
later
and
he
looked
round
at
rost6v
.
come
to
me
after
the
review
and
we
will
do
what
is
possible
.
and
having
glanced
round
the
room
prince
andrew
turned
to
rostov
whose
state
of
unconquerable
childish
embarrassment
now
changing
to
anger
he
did
not
condescend
to
notice
and
said
i
think
you
were
talking
of
the
schon
grabern
affair
were
you
there
book
three
i
was
there
said
rost6v
angrily
as
if
in
tending
to
insult
the
aidedecamp
.
bolk6nski
noticed
the
hussars
state
of
mind
and
it
amused
him
.
with
a
slightly
contemptu
ous
smile
he
said
yes
there
are
many
stories
now
told
about
that
affair
yes
stories
repeated
rost6v
loudly
look
ing
with
eyes
suddenly
grown
furious
now
at
boris
now
at
bolk6nski
.
yes
many
stories
but
our
stories
are
the
stories
of
men
who
have
been
under
the
enemys
fire
our
stories
have
some
weight
not
like
the
stories
of
those
fel
lows
on
the
staff
who
get
rewards
without
do
ing
anything
of
whom
you
imagine
me
to
be
one
said
prince
andrew
with
a
quiet
and
particularly
amiable
smile
.
a
strange
feeling
of
exasperation
and
yet
of
respect
for
this
mans
selfpossession
mingled
at
that
moment
in
rost6vs
soul
.
i
am
not
talking
about
you
he
said
i
dont
know
you
and
frankly
i
dont
want
to
.
i
am
speaking
of
the
staff
in
general
.
and
i
will
tell
you
this
prince
andrew
in
terrupted
in
a
tone
of
quiet
authority
you
wish
to
insult
me
and
i
am
ready
to
agree
with
you
that
it
would
be
very
easy
to
do
so
if
you
havent
sufficient
selfrespect
but
admit
that
the
time
and
place
are
very
badly
chosen
.
in
a
day
or
two
we
shall
all
have
to
take
part
in
a
greater
and
more
serious
duel
and
besides
drubetsk6y
who
says
he
is
an
old
friend
of
yours
is
not
at
all
to
blame
that
my
face
has
the
misfortune
to
displease
you
.
however
he
added
rising
you
know
my
name
and
where
to
find
me
but
dont
forget
that
i
do
not
re
gard
either
myself
or
you
as
having
been
at
all
insulted
and
as
a
man
older
than
you
my
ad
vice
is
to
let
the
matter
drop
.
well
then
on
friday
after
the
review
i
shall
expect
you
drubetsk6y
.
au
revoir
exclaimed
prince
an
drew
and
with
a
bow
to
them
both
he
went
out
.
only
when
prince
andrew
was
gone
did
rost6v
think
of
what
he
ought
to
have
said
.
and
he
was
still
more
angry
at
having
omitted
to
say
it
.
he
ordered
his
horse
at
once
and
coldly
taking
leave
of
boris
rode
home
.
should
he
go
to
headquarters
next
day
and
challenge
that
affected
adjutant
or
really
let
the
matter
drop
was
the
question
that
worried
him
all
the
way
.
he
thought
angrily
of
the
pleasure
he
would
have
at
seeing
the
fright
of
that
small
and
frail
but
proud
man
when
covered
by
his
pistol
and
then
he
felt
with
surprise
that
of
all
the
men
he
knew
there
was
none
he
would
so
much
like
to
have
for
a
friend
as
that
very
adjutant
whom
he
so
hated
.
chapter
viii
the
day
after
rost6v
had
been
to
see
boris
a
review
was
held
of
the
austrian
and
russian
troops
both
those
freshly
arrived
from
russia
and
those
who
had
been
campaigning
under
kutuzov
.
the
two
emperors
the
russian
with
his
heir
the
tsardvich
and
the
austrian
with
the
archduke
inspected
the
allied
army
of
eighty
thousand
men
.
from
early
morning
the
smart
clean
troops
were
on
the
move
forming
up
on
the
field
be
fore
the
fortress
.
now
thousands
of
feet
and
bayonets
moved
and
halted
at
the
officers
com
mand
turned
with
banners
flying
formed
up
at
intervals
and
wheeled
round
other
similar
masses
of
infantry
in
different
uniforms
now
was
heard
the
rhythmic
beat
of
hoofs
and
the
jingling
of
showy
cavalry
in
blue
red
and
green
braided
uniforms
with
smartly
dressed
bandsmen
in
front
mounted
on
black
roan
or
gray
horses
then
again
spreading
out
with
the
brazen
clatter
of
the
polished
shining
cannon
that
quivered
on
the
gun
carriages
and
with
the
smell
of
linstocks
came
the
artillery
which
crawled
between
the
infantry
and
cavalry
and
took
up
its
appointed
position
.
not
only
the
generals
in
full
parade
uniforms
with
their
thin
or
thick
waists
drawn
in
to
the
utmost
their
red
necks
squeezed
into
their
stiff
collars
and
wearing
scarves
and
all
their
decorations
not
only
the
elegant
pomaded
officers
but
every
soldier
with
his
freshly
washed
and
shaven
face
and
his
weapons
clean
and
pol
ished
to
the
utmost
and
every
horse
groomed
till
its
coat
shone
like
satin
and
every
hair
of
its
wetted
mane
lay
smooth
felt
that
no
small
matter
was
happening
but
an
important
and
solemn
affair
.
every
general
and
every
soldier
was
conscious
of
his
own
insignificance
aware
of
being
but
a
drop
in
that
ocean
of
men
and
yet
at
thesame
time
was
conscious
of
his
strength
as
a
part
of
that
enormous
whole
.
from
early
morning
strenuous
activities
and
efforts
had
begun
and
by
ten
oclock
all
had
been
brought
into
due
order
.
the
ranks
were
drown
up
on
the
vast
field
.
the
whole
army
was
extended
in
three
lines
the
cavalry
in
front
behind
it
the
artillery
and
behind
that
again
the
infantry
.
a
space
like
a
street
was
left
between
each
two
lines
of
troops
.
the
three
parts
of
that
army
were
sharply
distinguished
kutiizovs
fighting
army
with
the
pdvlograds
on
the
right
136
war
and
peace
flank
of
the
front
those
recently
arrived
from
russia
both
guards
and
regiments
of
the
line
and
the
austrian
troops
.
but
they
all
stood
in
the
same
lines
under
one
command
and
in
a
like
order
.
like
wind
over
leaves
ran
an
excited
whisper
theyre
coming
theyre
com
ing
alarmed
voices
were
heard
and
a
stir
of
final
preparation
swept
over
all
the
troops
.
from
the
direction
of
olmiitz
in
front
of
them
a
group
was
seen
approaching
.
and
at
that
moment
though
the
day
was
still
a
light
gust
of
wind
blowing
over
the
army
slightly
stirred
the
streamers
on
the
lances
and
the
un
folded
standards
fluttered
against
their
staffs
.
it
looked
as
if
by
that
slight
motion
the
army
itself
was
expressing
its
joy
at
the
approach
of
the
emperors
.
one
voice
was
heard
shouting
eyes
front
then
like
the
crowing
of
cocks
at
sunrise
this
was
repeated
by
others
from
various
sides
and
all
became
silent
.
in
the
deathlike
stillness
only
the
tramp
of
horses
was
heard
.
this
was
the
emperors
suites
.
the
emperors
rode
up
to
the
flank
and
the
trumpets
of
the
first
cavalry
regiment
played
the
general
march
.
it
seemed
as
though
not
the
trumpeters
were
playing
but
as
if
the
army
it
self
rejoicing
at
the
emperors
approach
had
naturally
burst
into
music
.
amid
these
sounds
only
the
youthful
kindly
voice
of
the
emperor
alexander
was
clearly
heard
.
he
gave
the
words
of
greeting
and
the
first
regiment
roared
hur
rah
so
deafeningly
continuously
and
joy
fully
that
the
men
themselves
were
awed
by
their
multitude
and
the
immensity
of
the
pow
er
they
constituted
.
rostov
standing
in
the
front
lines
of
kutu
zovs
army
which
the
tsar
approached
first
ex
perienced
the
same
feeling
as
every
other
man
in
that
army
a
feeling
of
selfforgetfulness
a
proud
consciousness
of
might
and
a
passion
ate
attraction
to
him
who
was
the
cause
of
this
triumph
.
he
felt
that
at
a
single
word
from
that
man
all
this
vast
mass
and
he
himself
an
insignifi
cant
atom
in
it
would
go
through
fire
and
water
commit
crime
die
or
perform
deeds
of
highest
heroism
and
so
he
could
not
but
trem
ble
and
his
heart
stand
still
at
the
imminence
of
that
word
.
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
thundered
from
all
sides
one
regiment
after
another
greet
ing
the
tsar
with
the
strains
of
the
march
and
then
hurrah

.

.

.
then
the
general
march
and
again
hurrah
hurrah
growing
ever
stronger
and
fuller
and
merging
into
a
deafen
ing
roar
.
till
the
tsar
reached
it
each
regiment
in
its
silence
and
immobility
seemed
like
a
lifeless
body
but
as
soon
as
he
came
up
it
became
alive
its
thunder
joining
the
roar
of
the
whole
line
along
which
he
had
already
passed
.
through
the
terrible
and
deafening
roar
of
those
voices
amid
the
square
masses
of
troops
standing
motionless
as
if
turned
to
stone
hun
dreds
of
riders
composing
the
suites
moved
carelessly
but
symmetrically
and
above
all
free
ly
and
in
front
of
them
two
men
the
emper
ors
.
upon
them
the
undivided
tensely
passion
ate
attention
of
that
whole
mass
of
men
was
concentrated
.
the
handsome
young
emperor
alexander
in
the
uniform
of
the
horse
guards
wearing
a
cocked
hat
with
its
peaks
front
and
back
with
his
pleasant
face
and
resonant
though
not
loud
voice
attracted
everyones
attention
.
rostov
was
not
far
from
the
trumpeters
and
with
his
keen
sight
had
recognized
the
tsar
and
watched
his
approach
.
when
he
was
with
in
twenty
paces
and
nicholas
could
clearly
distinguish
every
detail
of
his
handsome
hap
py
young
face
he
experienced
a
feeling
of
tend
erness
and
ecstasy
such
as
he
had
never
be
fore
known
.
every
trait
and
every
movement
of
the
tsars
seemed
to
him
enchanting
.
stopping
in
front
of
the
pdvlograds
the
tsar
said
something
in
french
to
the
austrian
em
peror
and
smiled
.
seeing
that
smile
rost6v
involuntarily
smiled
himself
and
felt
a
still
stronger
flow
of
love
for
his
sovereign
.
he
longed
to
show
that
love
in
some
way
and
knowing
that
this
was
impos
sible
was
ready
to
cry
.
the
tsar
called
the
colo
nel
of
the
regiment
and
said
a
few
words
to
him
.
oh
god
what
would
happen
to
me
if
the
emperor
spoke
to
me
thought
rost6v
.
i
should
die
of
happiness
the
tsar
addressed
the
officers
also
i
thank
you
all
gentlemen
i
thank
you
with
my
whole
heart
.
to
rost6v
every
word
sounded
like
a
voice
from
heaven
.
how
gladly
would
he
have
died
at
once
for
his
tsar
you
have
earned
the
st
.
georges
standards
and
will
be
worthy
of
them
.
oh
to
die
to
die
for
him
thought
rost6v
.
the
tsar
said
something
more
which
ros
t6v
did
not
hear
and
the
soldiers
straining
their
lungs
shouted
hurrah
rost6v
too
bending
over
his
saddle
shouted
hurrah
with
all
his
might
feeling
that
he
book
would
like
to
injure
himself
by
that
shout
if
only
to
express
his
rapture
fully
.
the
tsar
stopped
a
few
minutes
in
front
of
the
hussars
as
if
undecided
.
how
can
the
emperor
be
undecided
thought
rost6v
but
then
even
this
indecision
appeared
to
him
majestic
and
enchanting
like
everything
else
the
tsar
did
.
that
hesitation
lasted
only
an
instant
.
the
tsars
foot
in
the
narrow
pointed
boot
then
fashionable
touched
the
groin
of
the
bobtailed
bay
mare
he
rode
his
hand
in
a
white
glove
gathered
up
the
reins
and
he
moved
off
accom
panied
by
an
irregularly
swaying
sea
of
aides
decamp
.
farther
and
farther
he
rode
away
stopping
at
other
regiments
till
at
last
only
his
white
plumes
were
visible
to
rost6v
from
amid
the
suites
that
surrounded
the
emperors
.
among
the
gentlemen
of

bolk6nski
sitting
his
horse
indolently
and
carelessly
.
rost6v
recalled
their
quarrel
of
yesterday
and
the
question
presented
itself
whether
he
ought
or
ought
not
to
challenge
bolk6nski
.
of
course
not
he
now
thought
.
is
it
worth
thinking
or
speaking
of
it
at
such
a
moment
at
a
time
of
such
love
such
rap
ture
and
such
selfsacrifice
what
do
any
of
our
quarrels
and
affronts

and
for

everybody
now
.
when
the
emperor
had
passed
nearly

a
ceremonial

rode
past
too
at
the
rear
of
his
squadron
that
is
alone
and
in

of
the
emperor
.
before
he
reached
him
rost6v
who
was
a
splendid
horseman
spurred
bedouin
twice
and
successfully
put
him
to
the
showy
trot
in
which
the

went

excited

rost6v
himself
his

past

it
.
fine

remarked
the

.
my
god
how
happy
i
should
be
if
he
or
dered
me
to
leap
into
the
fire
this
instant
thought
rost6v
.
when
the
review
was
over
the
newly
ar
three
137
rived
officers
and
also
kuttizovs
collected
in
groups
and
began
to
talk
about
the
awards
about
the
austrians
and
their
uniforms
about
their
lines
about
bonaparte
and
how
badly
the
latter
would
fare
now
especially
if
the
es
sen
corps
arrived
and
prussia
took
our
side
.
but
the
talk
in
every
group
was
chiefly
about
the
emperor
alexander
.
his
every
word
and
movement
was
described
with
ecstasy
.
they
all
had
but
one
wish
to
advance
as
soon
as
possible
against
the
enemy
under
the
emperors
command
.
commanded
by
the
em
peror

they
could
not
fail
to
vanquish
anyone

it
whom
it
might
so
thought
ros
tov
and
most
of
the
officers
after
the
review
.
all
were
then
more
confident
of
victory
than
the
winning
of
two
battles
would
have
made
them
.
chapter
ix
the
day
after
the
review
boris
in
his
best
uniform
and
with
his
comrade
bergs
best
wishes
for
success
rode
to
olmiitz
to
see
bol
konski
wishing
to
profit
by
his
friendliness
and
obtain
for
himself
the
best
post
he
could
pref
erably
that
of
adjutant
to
some
important
personage
a
position
in
the
army
which
seemed
to
him
most
attractive
.
it
is
all
very
well
for
rost6v
whose
father
sends
him
ten
thousand
rubles
at
a
time
to
talk
about
not
wishing
to
cringe
to
anybody
and
not
be
anyones
lackey
but
i
who
have
nothing
but
my
brains
have
to
make
a
career
and
must
not
miss
opportunities
but
must
avail
myself
of
them
he
reflected
.
he
did
not
find
prince
andrew
in
olmiitz
that
day
but
the
appearance
of
the
town
where
the
headquarters
and
the
diplomatic
corps
were
stationed
and
the
two
emperors
were
living
with
their
suites
households
and
courts
only
strengthened
his
desire
to
belong
to
that
higher
world
.
he
knew
no
one
and
despite
his
smart
guardsmans
uniform
all
these
exalted
per
sonages
passing
in
the
streets
in
their
elegant
carriages
with
their
plumes
ribbons
and
med
als
both
courtiers
and
military
men
seemed
so
immeasurably
above
him
an
insignificant
officer
of
the
guards
that
they
not
only
did
not
wish
to
but
simply
could
not
be
aware
of
his
existence
.
at
the
quarters
of
the
command
er
in
chief
kutiizov
where
he
inquired
for
bolk6nski
all
the
adjutants
and
even
the
or
derlies
looked
at
him
as
if
they
wished
to
im
press
on
him
that
a
great
many
officers
like
him
were
always
coming
there
and
that
every
body
was
heartily
sick
of
them
.
in
spite
of
this
138
war
and
peace
or
rather
because
of
it
next
day
november
15
after
dinner
he
again
went
to
olmiitz
and
en
tering
the
house
occupied
by
kutiizov
asked
for
bolk6nski
.
prince
andrew
was
in
and
boris
was
shown
into
a
large
hall
probably
formerly
used
for
dancing
but
in
which
five
beds
now
stood
and
furniture
of
various
kinds
a
table
chairs
and
a
clavichord
.
one
adjutant
near
est
the
door
was
sitting
at
the
table
in
a
per
sian
dressing
gown
writing
.
another
the
red
stout
nesvitski
lay
on
a
bed
with
his
arms
un
der
his
head
laughing
with
an
officer
who
had
sat
down
beside
him
.
a
third
was
playing
a
vi
ennese
waltz
on
the
clavichord
while
a
fourth
lying
on
the
clavichord
sang
the
tune
.
bol
k6nski
was
not
there
.
none
of
these
gentlemen
changed
his
position
on
seeing
boris
.
the
one
who
was
writing
and
whom
boris
addressed
turned
round
crossly
and
told
him
bolk6nski
was
on
duty
and
that
he
should
go
through
the
door
on
the
left
into
the
reception
room
if
he
wished
to
see
him
.
boris
thanked
him
and
went
to
the
reception
room
where
he
found
some
ten
officers
and
generals
.
when
he
entered
prince
andrew
his
eyes
drooping
contemptuously
with
that
peculiar
expression
of
polite
weariness
which
plainly
says
if
it
were
not
my
duty
i
would
not
talk
to
you
for
a
moment
was
listening
to
an
old
russian
general
with
decorations
who
stood
very
erect
almost
on
tiptoe
with
a
soldiers
obsequious
expression
on
his
purple
face
re
porting
something
.
very
well
then
be
so
good
as
to
wait
said
prince
andrew
to
the
general
in
russian
speaking
with
the
french
intonation
he
affect
ed
when
he
wished
to
speak
contemptuously
and
noticing
boris
prince
andrew
paying
no
more
heed
to
the
general
who
ran
after
him
imploring
him
to
hear
something
more
nod
ded
and
turned
to
him
with
a
cheerful
smile
.
at
that
moment
boris
clearly
realized
what
he
had
before
surmised
that
in
the
army
be
sides
the
subordination
and
discipline
pre
scribed
in
the
military
code
which
he
and
the
others
knew
in
the
regiment
there
was
another
more
important
subordination
which
made
this
tightlaced
purplefaced
general
wait
re
spectfully
while
captain
prince
andrew
for
his
own
pleasure
chose
to
chat
with
lieutenant
drubetsk6y
.
more
than
ever
was
boris
re
solved
to
serve
in
future
not
according
to
the
written
code
but
under
this
unwritten
law
.
he
felt
now
that
merely
by
having
been
rec
ommended
to
prince
andrew
he
had
already
risen
above
the
general
who
at
the
front
had
the
power
to
annihilate
him
a
lieutenant
of
the
guards
.
prince
andrew
came
up
to
him
and
took
his
hand
.
i
am
very
sorry
you
did
not
find
me
in
yes
terday
.
i
was
fussing
about
with
germans
all
day
.
we
went
with
weyrother
to
survey
the
dispositions
.
when
germans
start
being
ac
curate
theres
no
end
to
it
i
boris
smiled
as
if
he
understood
what
prince
andrew
was
alluding
to
as
something
general
ly
known
.
but
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
weyrothers
name
or
even
the
term
disposi
tions
.
well
my
dear
fellow
so
you
still
want
to
be
an
adjutant
i
have
been
thinking
about
you
.
yes
i
was
thinking
for
some
reason
boris
could
not
help
blushing
of
asking
the
com
mander
in
chief
.
he
has
had
a
letter
from
prince
kurdgin
about
me
.
i
only
wanted
to
ask
because
i
fear
the
guards
wont
be
in
ac
tion
he
added
as
if
in
apology
.
all
right
all
right
.
well
talk
it
over
re
plied
prince
andrew
.
only
let
me
report
this
gentlemans
business
and
i
shall
be
at
your
disposal
.
while
prince
andrew
went
to
report
about
the
purplefaced
general
that
gentleman
evi
dently
not
sharing
boris
conception
of
the
ad
vantages
of
the
unwritten
code
of
subordina
tionlooked
so
fixedly
at
the
presumptuous
lieutenant
who
had
prevented
his
finishing
what
he
had
to
say
to
the
adjutant
that
boris
felt
uncomfortable
.
he
turned
away
and
waited
impatiently
for
prince
andrews
return
from
the
commander
in
chiefs
room
.
you
see
my
dear
fellow
i
have
been
think
ing
about
you
said
prince
andrew
when
they
had
gone
into
the
large
room
where
the
clavi
chord
was
.
its
no
use
your
going
to
the
com
mander
in
chief
.
he
would
say
a
lot
of
pleas
ant
things
ask
you
to
dinner
that
would
not
be
bad
as
regards
the
unwritten
code
thought
boris
but
nothing
more
would
come
of
it
.
there
will
soon
be
a
battalion
of
us
aides
decamp
and
adjutants
but
this
is
what
well
do
i
have
a
good
friend
an
adjutant
general
and
an
excellent
fellow
prince
dolgorukov
and
though
you
may
not
know
it
the
fact
is
that
now
kutiizov
with
his
staff
and
all
of
us
count
for
nothing
.
everything
is
now
centered
round
the
emperor
.
so
we
will
go
to
dolgoru
kov
i
have
to
go
there
anyhow
and
i
have
al
ready
spoken
to
him
about
you
.
we
shall
see
whether
he
cannot
attach
you
to
himself
or
find
a
place
for
you
somewhere
nearer
the
sun
.
prince
andrew
always
became
specially
keen
when
he
had
to
guide
a
young
man
and
help
him
to
worldly
success
.
under
cover
of
obtain
ing
help
of
this
kind
for
another
which
from
pride
he
would
never
accept
for
himself
he
kept
in
touch
with
the
circle
which
confers
suc
cess
and
which
attracted
him
.
he
very
readily
took
up
boris
cause
and
went
with
him
to
dol
goriikov
.
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
they
entered
the
palace
at
olmiitz
occupied
by
the
emper
ors
and
their
retinues
.
that
same
day
a
council
of
war
had
been
held
in
which
all
the
members
of
the
hof
kriegsrath
and
both
emperors
took
part
.
at
that
council
contrary
to
the
views
of
the
old
generals
kutiizov
and
prince
schwartzenberg
it
had
been
decided
to
advance
immediately
and
give
battle
to
bonaparte
.
the
council
of
war
was
just
over
when
prince
andrew
accom
panied
by
boris
arrived
at
the
palace
to
find
dolgorukov
.
everyone
at
headquarters
was
still
under
the
spell
of
the
days
council
at
which
the
party
of
the
young
had
triumphed
.
the
voices
of
those
who
counseled
delay
and
ad
vised
waiting
for
something
else
before
advanc
ing
had
been
so
completely
silenced
and
their
arguments
confuted
by
such
conclusive
evi
dence
of
the
advantages
of
attacking
that
what
had
been
discussed
at
the
council
the
coming
battle
and
the
victory
that
would
certainly
re
sult
from
it
no
longer
seemed
to
be
in
the
future
but
in
the
past
.
all
the
advantages
were
on
our
side
.
our
enormous
forces
undoubted
ly
superior
to
napoleons
were
concentrated
in
one
place
the
troops
inspired
by
the
em
perors
presence
were
eager
for
action
.
the
strategic
position
where
the
operations
would
take
place
was
familiar
in
all
its
details
to
the
austrian
general
weyrother
a
lucky
accident
had
ordained
that
the
austrian
army
should
maneuver
the
previous
year
on
the
very
fields
where
the
french
had
now
to
be
fought
the
adjacent
locality
was
known
and
shown
in
every
detail
on
the
maps
and
bonaparte
evi
dently
weakened
was
undertaking
nothing
.
dolgorukov
one
of
the
warmest
advocates
of
an
attack
had
just
returned
from
the
coun
cil
tired
and
exhausted
but
eager
and
proud
of
the
victory
that
had
been
gained
.
prince
andrew
introduced
his
protg
but
prince
dolgonikov
politely
and
firmly
pressing
his
hand
said
nothing
to
boris
and
evidently
un
able
to
suppress
the
thoughts
which
were
up
permost
in
his
mind
at
that
moment
addressed
prince
andrew
in
french
book
three
139
ah
my
dear
fellow
what
a
battle
we
have
gained
god
grant
that
the
one
that
will
result
from
it
will
be
as
victorious
however
my
dear
fellow
he
said
abruptly
and
eagerly
i
must
confess
to
having
been
unjust
to
the
austrians
and
especially
to
weyrother
.
what
exactitude
what
minuteness
what
knowledge
of
the
local
ity
what
foresight
for
every
eventuality
every
possibility
even
to
the
smallest
detail
1
no
my
dear
fellow
no
conditions
better
than
our
pres
ent
ones
could
have
been
devised
.
this
combi
nation
of
austrian
precision
with
russian
val
orwhat
more
could
be
wished
for
so
the
attack
is
definitely
resolved
on
asked
bolk6nski
.
and
do
you
know
my
dear
fellow
it
seems
to
me
that
bonaparte
has
decidedly
lost
his
bearings
you
know
that
a
letter
was
received
from
him
today
for
the
emperor
.
dolgorukov
smiled
significantly
.
is
that
so
and
what
did
he
say
inquired
bolkonski
.
what
can
he
say
tradiridira
and
so
on

.

.

.
merely
to
gain
time
.
i
tell
you
he
is
in
our
hands
thats
certain
but
what
was
most
amus
ing
he
continued
with
a
sudden
goodna
tured
laugh
was
that
we
could
not
think
how
to
address
the
reply
if
not
as
consul
and
of
course
not
as
emperor
it
seemed
to
me
it
should
be
to
general
bonaparte
.

but
between
not
recognizing
him
as
em
peror
and
calling
him
general
bonaparte
there
is
a
difference
remarked
bolk6nski
.
thats
just
it
interrupted
dolgoriikov
quickly
laughing
.
you
know
bilfbin
hes
a
very
clever
fellow
.
he
suggested
addressing
him
as
usurper
and
enemy
of
mankind
.

dolgorukov
laughed
merrily
.
only
that
said
bolk6nski
.
all
the
same
it
was
bilibin
who
found
a
suitable
form
for
the
address
.
he
is
a
wise
and
clever
fellow
.
what
was
it
to
the
head
of
the
french
government

.

.

.
au
chef
du
gouvernement
franfais
said
dolgorukov
with
grave
satisfaction
.
good
wasnt
it
yes
but
he
will
dislike
it
extremely
said
bolk6nski
.
oh
yes
very
much
my
brother
knows
him
hes
dined
with
him
the
present
emperor
more
than
once
in
paris
and
tells
me
he
never
met
a
more
cunning
or
subtle
diplomatist
you
know
a
combination
of
french
adroitness
and
italian
playacting
do
you
know
the
tale
about
him
and
count
mark6v
count
mark6v

war
and
peace
was
the
only
man
who
knew
how
to
handle
him
.
you
know
the
story
of
the
handkerchief
it
is
delightful
and
the
talkative
dolgorukov
turning
now
to
boris
now
to
prince
andrew
told
how
bonaparte
wishing
to
test
mark6v
our
ambas
sador
purposely
dropped
a
handkerchief
in
front
of
him
and
stood
looking
at
mark6v
probably
expecting
mark6v
to
pick
it
up
for
him
and
how
mark6v
immediately
dropped
his
own
beside
it
and
picked
it
up
without
touching
bonapartes
.
delightful
said
bolk6nski
.
but
i
have
come
to
you
prince
as
a
petitioner
on
behalf
of
this
young
man
.
you
see

.

.

.
but
before
prince
andrew
could
finish
an
aidedecamp
came
in
to
summon
dolgorukov
to
the
emper
or
.
oh
what
a
nuisance
said
dolgorukov
getting
up
hurriedly
and
pressing
the
hands
of
prince
andrew
and
boris
.
you
know
i
should
be
very
glad
to
do
all
in
my
power
both
for
you
and
for
this

again
he
pressed
the
hand
of
the
latter
with
an
expression
of
goodnatured
sincere
and
animated
levity

another
time
boris
was
excited
by
the
thought
of
being
so
close
to
the
higher
powers
as
he
felt
himself
to
be
at
that
moment
.
he
was
conscious
that
here
he
was
in
contact
with
the
springs
that
set
in
motion
the
enormous
movements
of
the
mass
of
which
in
his
regiment
he
felt
himself
a
tiny
obedient
and
insignificant
atom
.
they
fol
lowed
prince
dolgorukov
out
into
the
corri
dor
and
met
coming
out
of
the
door
of
the
emperors
room
by
which
dolgoriikov
had
en
tereda
short
man
in
civilian
clothes
with
a
clever
face
and
sharply
projecting
jaw
which
without
spoiling
his
face
gave
him
a
peculiar
vivacity
and
shiftiness
of
expression
.
this
short
man
nodded
to
dolgorukov
as
to
an
intimate
friend
and
stared
at
prince
andrew
with
cool
intensity
walking
straight
toward
him
and
evidently
expecting
him
to
bow
or
to
step
out
of
his
way
.
prince
andrew
did
neither
a
look
of
animosity
appeared
on
his
face
and
the
oth
er
turned
away
and
went
down
the
side
of
the
corridor
.
who
was
that
asked
boris
.
he
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
but
to
me
most
unpleasant
of
men
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
prince
adam
czartoryski
.

.

.

.
it
is
such
men
as
he
who
decide
the
fate
of
nations
added
bolk6nski
with
a
sigh
he
could
not
suppress
as
they
passed
out
of
the
palace
.
next
day
the
army
began
its
campaign
and
up
to
tle
very
battle
of
austerlitz
boris
was
unable
to
see
either
prince
andrew
or
dol
goriikov
again
and
remained
for
a
while
with
the
ismdylov
regiment
.
chapter
x
at
dawn
on
the
sixteenth
of
november
denf
sovs
squadron
in
which
nicholas
rost6v
served
and
which
was
in
prince
bagrati6ns
detach
ment
moved
from
the
place
where
it
had
spent
the
night
advancing
into
action
as
ar
ranged
and
after
going
behind
other
columns
for
about
two
thirds
of
a
mile
was
stopped
on
the
highroad
.
rost6v
saw
the
cossacks
and
then
the
first
and
second
squadrons
of
hussars
and
infantry
battalions
and
artillery
pass
by
and
go
forward
and
then
generals
bagrati6n
and
dolgorukov
ride
past
with
their
adjutants
.
all
the
fear
before
action
which
he
had
experi
enced
as
previously
all
the
inner
struggle
to
conquer
that
fear
all
his
dreams
of
distin
guishing
himself
as
a
true
hussar
in
this
battle
had
been
wasted
.
their
squadron
remained
in
reserve
and
nicholas
rost6v
spent
that
day
in
a
dull
and
wretched
mood
.
at
nine
in
the
morn
ing
he
heard
firing
in
front
and
shouts
of
hur
rah
and
saw
wounded
being
brought
back
there
were
not
many
of
them
and
at
last
he
saw
how
a
whole
detachment
of
french
caval
ry
was
brought
in
convoyed
by
a
sdtnya
of
cossacks
.
evidently
the
affair
was
over
and
though
not
big
had
been
a
successful
engage
ment
.
the
men
and
officers
returning
spoke
of
a
brilliant
victory
of
the
occupation
of
the
town
of
wischau
and
the
capture
of
a
whole
french
squadron
.
the
day
was
bright
and
sun
ny
after
a
sharp
night
frost
and
the
cheerful
glitter
of
that
autumn
day
was
in
keeping
with
the
news
of
victory
which
was
conveyed
not
only
by
the
tales
of
those
who
had
taken
part
in
it
but
also
by
the
joyful
expression
on
the
faces
of
soldiers
officers
generals
and
adju
tants
as
they
passed
rostov
going
or
coming
.
and
nicholas
who
had
vainly
suffered
all
the
dread
that
precedes
a
battle
and
had
spent
that
happy
day
in
inactivity
was
all
the
more
depressed
.
come
here

lets
dwink
to
dwown
our
gwief
shouted
denisov
who
had
settled
down
by
the
roadside
with
a
flask
and
some
food
.
the
officers
gathered
round

eating
and
talking

one
of

dragoon
who
was
being
brought
in
on
foot
by
two
cossacks
.
one
of
them
was
leading
by
the
bridle
a
fine
large
french
horse
he
had
taken
from
the
pris
oner
.
sell
us
that
horse
denfsov
called
out
to
the
cossacks
.
if
you
like
your
honor
the
officers
got
up
and
stood
round
the
cos
sacks
and
their
prisoner
.
the
french
dragoon
was
a
young
alsatian
who
spoke
french
with
a
german
accent
.
he
was
breathless
with
agita
tion
his
face
was
red
and
when
he
heard
some
french
spoken
he
at
once
began
speaking
to
the
officers
addressing
first
one
then
another
.
he
said
he
would
not
have
been
taken
it
was
not
his
fault
but
the
corporals
who
had
sent
him
to
seize
some
horsecloths
though
he
had
told
him
the
russians
were
there
.
and
at
every
word
he
added
but
dont
hurt
my
little
horse
and
stroked
the
animal
.
it
was
plain
that
he
did
not
quite
grasp
where
he
was
.
now
he
excused
himself
for
having
been
taken
pris
oner
and
now
imagining
himself
before
his
own
officers
insisted
on
his
soldierly
discipline
and
zeal
in
the
service
.
he
brought
with
him
into
our
rearguard
all
the
freshness
of
atmos
phere
of
the
french
army
which
was
so
alien
to
us
.
the
cossacks
sold
the
horse
for
two
gold
pieces
and
rost6v
being
the
richest
of
the
of
ficers
now
that
he
had
received
his
money
bought
it
.
but
dont
hurt
my
little
horse
said
the
alsatian
goodnaturedly
to
rost6v
when
the
animal
was
handed
over
to
the
hussar
.
rost6v
smilingly
reassured
the
dragoon
and
gave
him
money
.
alley

said
the
cossack
touching
the
prisoners
arm
to
make
him
go
on
.
the
emperor
the
emperor
was
sud
denly
heard
among
the
hussars
.
all
began
to
run
and
bustle
and
rost6v
saw
coming
up
the
road
behind
him
several
riders
with
white
plumes
in
their
hats
.
in
a
moment
everyone
was
in
his
place
waiting
.
rost6v
did
not
know
or
remember
how
he
ran
to
his
place
and
mounted
.
instantly
his
re
gret
at
not
having
been
in
action
and
his
de
jected
mood
amid
people
of
whom
he
was
weary
had
gone
instantly
every
thought
of
himself
had
vanished
.
he
was
filled
with
hap
piness
at
his
nearness
to
the
emperor
.
he
felt
that
this
nearness
by
itself
made
up
to
him
for
the
day
he
had
lost
.
he
was
happy
as
a
lover
when
the
longedfor
moment
of
meeting
ar
rives
.
not
daring
to
look
round
and
without
looking
round
he
was
ecstatically
conscious
of
his
approach
.
he
felt
it
not
only
from
the
sound
of
the
hoofs
of
the
approaching
caval
cade
but
because
as
he
drew
near
everything
grew
brighter
more
joyful
more
significant
and
more
festive
around
him
.
nearer
and
near
er
to
rost6v
came
that
sun
shedding
beams
of
mild
and
majestic
light
around
and
already
he
felt
himself
enveloped
in
those
beams
he
heard
his
voice
that
kindly
calm
and
majestic
voice
that
was
yet
so
simple
and
as
if
in
ac
cord
with
rostovs
feeling
there
was
a
deathly
stillness
amid
which
was
heard
the
emperors
voice
.
the
pavlograd
hussars
he
inquired
.
the
reserves
sire
replied
a
voice
a
very
human
one
compared
to
that
which
had
said
the
pdvlograd
hussars
the
emperor
drew
level
with
rostov
and
halted
.
alexanders
face
was
even
more
beau
tiful
than
it
had
been
three
days
before
at
the
review
.
it
shone
with
such
gaiety
and
youth
such
innocent
youth
that
it
suggested
the
live
liness
of
a
fourteenyearold
boy
and
yet
it
was
the
face
of
the
majestic
emperor
.
casually
while
surveying
the
squadron
the
emperors
eyes
met
rostovs
and
rested
on
them
for
not
more
than
two
seconds
.
whether
or
no
the
emperor
understood
what
was
going
on
in
rostovs
soul
it
seemed
to
rostov
that
he
un
derstood
everything
at
any
rate
his
lightblue
eyes
gazed
for
about
two
seconds
into
rost6vs
face
.
a
gentle
mild
light
poured
from
them
.
then
all
at
once
he
raised
his
eyebrows
ab
ruptly
touched
his
horse
with
his
left
foot
and
galloped
on
.
the
younger
emperor
could
not
restrain
his
wish
to
be
present
at
the
battle
and
in
spite
of
the
remonstrances
of
his
courtiers
at
twelve
oclock
left
the
third
column
with
which
he
had
been
and
galloped
toward
the
vanguard
.
before
he
came
up
with
the
hussars
several
adjutants
met
him
with
news
of
the
successful
result
of
the
action
.
this
battle
which
consisted
in
the
capture
of
a
french
squadron
was
represented
as
a
brilliant
victory
over
the
french
and
so
the
emperor
and
the
whole
army
especially
while
the
smoke
hung
over
the
battlefield
believed
that
the
french
had
been
defeated
and
were
retreating
against
their
will
.
a
few
minutes
after
the
emperor
had
passed
the
pavlograd
division
was
ordered
to
advance
.
in
wischau
itself
a
petty
german
town
rostov
saw
the
emperor
again
.
in
the
market
place
where
142
war
and
peace
there
had
been
some
rather
heavy
firing
before
the
emperors
arrival
lay
several
killed
and
wounded
soldiers
whom
there
had
not
been
time
to
move
.
the
emperor
surrounded
by
his
suite
of
officers
and
courtiers
was
riding
a
bobtailed
chestnut
mare
a
different
one
from
that
which
he
had
ridden
at
the
review
and
bending
to
one
side
he
gracefully
held
a
gold
lorgnette
to
his
eyes
and
looked
at
a
soldier
who
lay
prone
with
blood
on
his
uncovered
head
.
the
wounded
soldier
was
so
dirty
coarse
and
revolting
that
his
proximity
to
the
emper
or
shocked
rostov
.
rost6v
saw
how
the
em
perors
rather
round
shoulders
shuddered
as
if
a
cold
shiver
had
run
down
them
how
his
left
foot
began
convulsively
tapping
the
horses
side
with
the
spur
and
how
the
welltrained
horse
looked
round
unconcerned
and
did
not
stir
.
an
adjutant
dismounting
lifted
the
sol
dier
under
the
arms
to
place
him
on
a
stretch
er
that
had
been
brought
.
the
soldier
groaned
.
gently
gentlyl
cant
you
do
it
more
gent
ly
said
the
emperor
apparently
suffering
more
than
the
dying
soldier
and
he
rode
away
.
rostov
saw
tears
filling
the
emperors
eyes
and
heard
him
as
he
was
riding
away
say
to
czartoryski
what
a
terrible
thing
war
is
what
a
terrible
thing
quelle
terrible
chose
que
la

the
troops
of
the
vanguard
were
stationed
before
wischau
within
sight
of
the
enemys
lines
which
all
day
long
had
yielded
ground
to
us
at
the
least
firing
.
the
emperors
gratitude
was
announced
to
the
vanguard
rewards
were
promised
and
the
men
received
a
double
ra
tion
of
vodka
.
the
campfires
crackled
and
the
soldiers
songs
resounded
even
more
merrily
than
on
theprevious
night
.
denisov
celebrated
his
promotion
to
the
rank
of
major
and
ros
t6v
who
had
already
drunk
enough
at
the
end
of
the
feast
proposed
the
emperors
health
.

the

the
enthusiastic

of

officers
.
and
the
old
cavalry
captain
kfrsten
shouted
enthusiastically
and
no
less
sincerely
than
the
twentyyearold
rost6v
.
when
the
officers
had
emptied
and
smashed
their
glasses
kirsten
filled
others
and
in

and
breeches
went
glass

to
the

and
with
his
long
gray

his
white

showing
under

he
stood
in

in

he
exclaimed
in
his
dashing
old
hussars
bari
tone
.
the
hussars
crowded
round
and
responded
heartily
with
loud
shouts
.

that
night
when
all
had
separated
denfsov
with
his
short
hand
patted

as

he
said
.

.

.

.
no
you
dont
understand
and
rostov
got
up
and
went
wandering
among
the
campfires
dreaming
of
what
happi
ness
it
would
be
to
die
not
in
saving
the
em
perors
life
he
did
not
even
dare
to
dream
of
that
but
simply
to
die
before
his
eyes
.
he
really
was
in
love
with
the
tsar
and
the
glory
of
the
russian
arms
and
the
hope
of
future
triumph
.
and
he
was
not
the
only
man
to
ex
perience
that
feeling
during
those
memorable
days
preceding
the
battle
of
austcrlitz
nine
tenths
of
the
men
in
the
russian
army
were
then
in
love
though
less
ecstatically
with
their
tsar
and
the
glory
of
the
russian
arms
.
chapter
xi
the
next
day
the
emperor
stopped
at
wis
chau
and
villier
his
physician
was
repeated
ly
summoned
to
see
him
.
at
headquarters
and
among
the
troops
near
by
the
news
spread
that
the
emperor
was
unwell
.
he
ate
nothing
and
had
slept
badly
that
night
those
around
him
reported
.
the
cause
of
this
indisposition
was
the
strong
impression
made
on
his
sensitive
mind
by
the
sight
of
the
killed
and
wounded
.
at
daybreak
on
the
seventeenth
a
french
officer
who
had
come
with
a
flag
of
truce
de
manding
an
audience
with
the
russian
em
peror
was
brought
into
wischau
from
our
out
book
three
143
posts
.
this
officer
was
savary
.
the
emperor
had
only
just
fallen
asleep
and
so
savary
had
to
wait
.
at
midday
he
was
admitted
to
the
em
peror
and
an
hour
later
he
rode
off
with
prince
dolgoriikovtothe
advanced
post
of
the
french
army
.
it
was
rumored
that
savary
had
been
sent
to
propose
to
alexander
a
meeting
with
napo
leon
.
to
the
joy
and
pride
of
the
whole
army
a
personal
interview
was
refused
and
instead
of
the
sovereign
prince
dolgorukov
the
vic
tor
at
wischau
was
sent
with
savary
to
negoti
ate
with
napoleon
if
contrary
to
expectations
these
negotiations
were
actuated
by
a
real
de
sire
for
peace
.
toward
evening
dolgorukov
came
back
went
straight
to
the
tsar
and
remained
alone
with
him
for
a
long
time
.
on
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
of
no
vember
the
army
advanced
two
days
march
and
the
enemys
outposts
after
a
brief
inter
change
of
shots
retreated
.
in
the
highest
army
circles
from
midday
on
the
nineteenth
a
great
excitedly
bustling
activity
began
whlh
lasted
till
the
morning
of
the
twentieth
when
the
memorable
battle
of
austerlitz
was
fought
.
till
midday
on
the
nineteenth
the
activity
the
eager
talk
running
to
and
fro
and
dis
patching
of
adjutants
was
con
fined
to
the
em
perors
headquarters
.
but
on
the
afternoon
of
that
day
this
activity
reached
kutiizovs
head
quarters
and
the
staffs
of
the
commanders
of
columns
.
by
evening
the
adjutants
had
spread
it
to
all
ends
and
parts
of
the
army
and
in
the
night
from
the
nineteenth
to
the
twentieth
the
whole
eighty
thousand
allied
troops
rose
from
their
bivouacs
to
the
hum
of
voices
and
the
army
swayed
and
started
in
one
enormous
mass
six
miles
long
.
the
concentrated
activity
which
had
begun
at
the
emperors
headquarters
in
the
morning
and
had
started
the
whole
movement
that
fol
lowed
was
like
the
first
movement
of
the
main
wheel
of
a
large
tower
clock
.
one
wheel
slow
ly
moved
another
was
set
in
motion
and
a
third
and
wheels
began
to
revolve
faster
and
faster
levers
and
cogwheels
to
work
chimes
to
play
figures
to
pop
out
and
the
hands
to
ad
vance
with
regular
motion
as
a
result
of
all
that
activity
.
just
as
in
the
mechanism
of
a
clock
so
in
the
mechanism
of
the
military
machine
an
im
pulse
once
given
leads
to
the
final
result
and
just
as
indifferently
quiescent
till
the
moment
when
motion
is
transmitted
to
them
are
the
parts
of
the
mechanism
which
the
impulse
has
not
yet
reached
.
wheels
creak
on
their
axles
as
the
cogs
engage
one
another
and
the
revolving
pulleys
whirr
with
the
rapidity
of
their
move
ment
but
a
neighboring
wheel
is
as
quiet
and
motionless
as
though
it
were
prepared
to
re
main
so
for
a
hundred
years
but
the
moment
comes
when
the
lever
catches
it
and
obeying
the
impulse
that
wheel
begins
to
creak
and
joins
in
the
common
motion
the
result
and
aim
of
which
are
beyond
its
ken
.
just
as
in
a
clock
the
result
of
the
compli
cated
motion
of
innumerable
wheels
and
pul
leys
is
merely
a
slow
and
regular
movement
of
the
hands
which
show
the
time
so
the
result
of
all
the
complicated
human
activities
of
1
60000
russians
and
french
all
their
passions
desires
remorse
humiliations
sufferings
out
bursts
of
pride
fear
and
enthusiasm
was
only
the
loss
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
the
socalled
battle
of
the
three
emperors
that
is
to
say
a
slow
movement
of
the
hand
on
the
dial
of
hu
man
history
.
prince
andrew
was
on
duty
that
day
and
in
constant
attendance
on
the
commander
in
chief
.
at
six
in
the
evening
kutiizov
went
to
the
emperors
headquarters
and
after
staying
but
a
short
time
with
the
tsar
went
to
see
the
grand
marshal
of
the
court
count
tolst6y
.
bolk6nski
took
the
opportunity
to
go
in
to
get
some
details
of
the
coming
action
from
dolgorukov
.
he
felt
that
kutiizov
was
upset
and
dissatisfied
about
something
and
that
at
headquarters
they
were
dissatisfied
with
him
and
also
that
at
the
emperors
headquarters
everyone
adopted
toward
him
the
tone
of
men
who
know
something
others
do
not
know
he
therefore
wished
to
speak
to
dolgorukov
.
well
how
dyou
do
my
dear
fellow
said
dolgorukov
who
was
sitting
at
tea
with
bili
bin
.
the
fete
is
for
tomorrow
.
how
is
your
old
fellow
out
of
sorts
i
wont
say
he
is
out
of
sorts
but
i
fancy
he
would
like
to
be
heard
.
but
they
heard
him
at
the
council
of
war
and
will
hear
him
when
he
talks
sense
but
to
temporize
and
wait
for
something
now
when
bonaparte
fears
nothing
so
much
as
a
general
battle
is
impossible
.
yes
you
have
seen
him
said
prince
an
drew
.
well
what
is
bonaparte
like
how
did
he
impress
you
yes
i
saw
him
and
am
convinced
that
he
fears
nothing
so
much
as
a
general
engage
ment
repeated
dolgonikov
evidently
priz
ing
this
general
conclusion
which
he
had
ar
144
war
and
peace
rived
at
from
his
interview
with
napoleon
.
if
he
werent
afraid
of
a
battle
why
did
he
ask
for
that
interview
why
negotiate
and
above
all
why
retreat
when
to
retreat
is
so
contrary
to
his
method
of
conducting
war
believe
me
he
is
afraid
afraid
of
a
general
battle
.
his
hour
has
come
mark
my
words
i
but
tell
me
what
is
he
like
eh
said
prince
andrew
again
.
he
is
a
man
in
a
gray
overcoat
very
anxi
ous
that
i
should
call
him
your
majesty
but
who
to
his
chagrin
got
no
title
frommel
thats
the
sort
of
man
he
is
and
nothing
more
re
plied
dolgoriikov
looking
round
at
bilibin
with
a
smile
.
despite
my
great
respect
for
old
kutiizov
he
continued
we
should
be
a
nice
set
of
fel
lows
if
we
were
to
wait
about
and
so
give
him
a
chance
to
escape
or
to
trick
us
now
that
we
certainly
have
him
in
our
hands
no
we
mustnt
forget
suv6rov
and
his
rule
not
to
put
yourself
in
a
position
to
be
attacked
but
yourself
to
attack
.
believe
me
in
war
the
en
ergy
of
young
men
often
shows
the
way
better
than
all
the
experience
of
old
cunctators
.
but
in
what
position
are
we
going
to
at
tack
him
i
have
been
at
the
outposts
today
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
where
his
chief
forces
are
situated
said
prince
andrew
.
he
wished
to
explain
to
dolgoriikov
a
plan
of
attack
he
had
himself
formed
.
oh
that
is
all
the
same
dolgoriikov
said
quickly
and
getting
up
he
spread
a
map
on
the
table
.
all
eventualities
have
been
fore
seen
.
if
he
is
standing
before
brunn

.

.

.
and
prince
dolgoriikov
rapidly
but
indis
tinctly
explained
weyrothers
plan
of
a
flank
ing
movement
.
prince
andrew
began
to
reply
and
to
state
his
own
plan
which
might
have
been
as
good
as
weyrothers
but
for
the
disadvantage
that
weyrothers
had
already
been
approved
.
as
soon
as
prince
andrew
began
to
demonstrate
the
defects
of
the
latter
and
the
merits
of
his
own
plan
prince
dolgoriikov
ceased
to
listen
to
him
and
gazed
absentmindedly
not
at
the
map
but
at
prince
andrews
face
.
there
will
be
a
council
of
war
at
kutiizovs
tonight
though
you
can
say
all
this
there
re
marked
dolgorukov
.
i
will
do
so
said
prince
andrew
moving
away
from
the
map
.
whatever
are
you
bothering
about
gentle
men
said
bilibin
who
till
then
had
listened
with
an
amused
smile
to
their
conversation
and
now
was
evidently
ready
with
a
joke
.
whether
tomorrow
brings
victory
or
defeat
the
glory
of
our
russian
arms
is
secure
.
except
your
kutiizov
there
is
not
a
single
russian
in
command
of
a
column
the
commanders
are
herr
general
wimpfen
le
comte
de
langer
on
le
prince
de
lichtenstein
le
prince
de
ho
henlohe
and
finally
prishprish
1
and
so
on
like
all
those
polish
names
.
be
quiet
backbiter
said
dolgoriikov
.
it
is
not
true
there
are
now
two
russians
milo
rddovich
and
dokhtiirov
and
there
would
be
a
third
count
arakchev
if
his
nerves
were
not
too
weak
.
however
i
think
general
kutiizov
has
come
out
said
prince
andrew
.
i
wish
you
good
luck
and
success
gentlemen
he
added
and
went
out
after
shaking
hands
with
dol
gorukov
and
bilibin
.
on
the
way
home
prince
andrew
could
not
refrain
from
asking
kutiizov
who
was
sitting
silently
beside
him
what
he
thought
of
tomor
rows
battle
.
kutiizov
looked
sternly
at
his
adjutant
and
after
a
pause
replied
i
think
the
battle
will
be
lost
and
so
i
told
count
tolst6y
and
asked
him
to
tell
the
emperor
.
what
do
you
think
he
replied
but
my
dear
general
i
am
en
gaged
with
rice
and
cutlets
look
after
military
matters
yourself
yes

.

.

.
that
was
the
answer
i
got
chapter
xii
shortly
after
nine
oclock
that
evening
wey
rother
drove
with
his
plans
to
kutiizovs
quar
ters
where
the
council
of
war
was
to
be
held
.
all
the
commanders
of
columns
were
sum
moned
to
the
commander
in
chiefs
and
with
the
exception
of
prince
bagrati6n
who
de
clined
to
come
were
all
there
at
the
appointed
time
.
weyrother
who
was
in
full
control
of
the
proposed
battle
by
his
eagerness
and
briskness
presented
a
marked
contrast
to
the
dissatisfied
and
drowsy
kutiizov
who
reluctantly
played
the
part
of
chairman
and
president
of
the
council
of
war
.
weyrother
evidently
felt
him
self
to
be
at
the
head
of
a
movement
that
had
already
become
unrestrainable
.
he
was
like
a
horse
running
downhill
harnessed
to
a
heavy
cart
.
whether
he
was
pulling
it
or
beingpushed
by
it
he
did
not
know
but
rushed
along
at
headlong
speed
with
no
time
to
consider
what
this
movement
might
lead
to
.
weyrother
had
been
twice
that
evening
to
the
enemys
picket
line
to
reconnoiter
personally
and
twice
to
the

general

tr

book
three
emperors
russian
and
austrian
to
report
and
explain
and
to
his
headquarters
where
he
had
dictated
the
dispositions
in
german
and
now
much
exhausted
he
arrived
at
kutiizovs
.
he
was
evidently
so
busy
that
he
even
for
got
to
be
polite
to
the
commander
in
chief
.
he
interrupted
him
talked
rapidly
and
indistinct
ly
without
looking
at
the
man
he
was
address
ing
and
did
not
reply
to
questions
put
to
him
.
he
was
bespattered
with
mud
and
had
a
piti
ful
weary
and
distracted
air
though
at
the
same
time
he
was
haughty
and
selfconfident
.
kutiizov
was
occupying
a
noblemans
castle
of
modest
dimensions
near
ostralitz
.
in
the
large
drawing
room
which
had
become
the
commander
in
chiefs
office
were
gathered
ku
tiizov
himself
weyrother
and
the
members
of
the
council
of
war
.
they
were
drinking
tea
and
only
awaited
prince
bagrati6n
to
begin
the
council
.
at
last
bagrati6ns
orderly
came
with
the
news
that
the
prince
could
not
at
tend
.
prince
andrew
came
in
to
inform
the
commander
in
chief
of
this
and
availing
him
self
of
permission
previously
given
him
by
ku
tiizov
to
be
present
at
the
council
he
remained
in
the
room
.
since
prince
bagration
is
not
coming
we
may
begin
said
weyrother
hurriedly
rising
from
his
seat
and
going
up
to
the
table
on
which
an
enormous
map
of
the
environs
of
briinn
was
spread
out
.
kutiizov
with
his
uniform
unbuttoned
so
that
his
fat
neck
bulged
over
his
collar
as
if
es
caping
was
sitting
almost
asleep
in
a
low
chair
with
his
podgy
old
hands
resting
symmetri
cally
on
its
arms
.
at
the
sound
of
weyrothers
voice
he
opened
his
one
eye
with
an
effort
.
yes
yes
if
you
please
1
it
is
already
late
said
he
and
nodding
his
head
he
let
it
droop
and
again
closed
his
eye
.
if
at
first
the
members
of
the
council
thought
that
kutiizov
was
pretending
to
sleep
the
sounds
his
nose
emitted
during
the
reading
that
followed
proved
that
the
commander
in
chief
at
that
moment
was
absorbed
by
a
far
more
serious
matter
than
a
desire
to
show
his
contempt
for
the
dispositions
or
anything
else
he
was
engaged
in
satisfying
the
irresistible
human
need
for
sleep
.
he
really
was
asleep
.
weyrother
with
the
gesture
of
a
man
too
busy
to
lose
a
moment
glanced
at
kutiizov
and
having
convinced
himself
that
he
was
asleep
took
up
a
paper
and
in
a
loud
monotonous
voice
began
to
read
out
the
dispositions
for
the
impending
battle
under
a
heading
which
he
also
read
out
dispositions
for
an
attack
on
the
enemy
position
behind
kobelnitz
and
sokolnitz
no
vember
30
1805
.
the
dispositions
were
very
complicated
and
difficult
.
they
began
as
follows
as
the
enemys
left
wing
rests
on
wooded
hills
and
his
right
extends
along
kobelnitz
and
sokolnitz
behind
the
pondsuhat
are
there
while
we
on
the
other
hand
with
our
left
wing
by
far
outflank
his
right
it
is
advantageous
to
attack
the
enemys
latter
wing
especially
if
we
occupy
the
villages
of
sokolnitz
and
kobelnitz
whereby
we
can
both
fall
on
his
flank
and
pur
sue
him
over
the
plain
between
schlappanitz
and
the
thuerassa
forest
avoiding
the
defiles
of
schlappanitz
and
bellowitz
which
cover
the
enemys
front
.
for
this
object
it
is
necessary
that

the
first
column
inarches

.

.

.
the
second
column
marches

.

.

.
the
third
column
marches

.

.

.
and
so
on
read
weyrother
.
the
generals
seemed
to
listen
reluctantly
to
the
difficult
dispositions
.
the
tall
fairhaired
general
buxhowden
stood
leaning
his
back
against
the
wall
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
burning
candle
and
seemed
not
to
listen
or
even
to
wish
to
be
thought
to
listen
.
exactly
opposite
weyrother
with
his
glistening
wideopen
eyes
fixed
upon
him
and
his
mustache
twisted
up
wards
sat
the
ruddy
milorddovich
in
a
mili
tary
pose
his
elbows
turned
outwards
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
his
shoulders
raised
.
he
remained
stubbornly
silent
gazing
at
wey
rothers
face
and
only
turned
away
his
eyes
when
the
austrian
chief
of
staff
finished
read
ing
.
then
milorddovich
looked
round
signifi
cantly
at
the
other
generals
.
but
one
could
not
tell
from
that
significant
look
whether
he
agreed
or
disagreed
and
was
satisfied
or
not
with
the
arrangements
.
next
to
weyrother
sat
count
langeron
who
with
a
subtle
smile
that
never
left
his
typically
southern
french
face
during
the
whole
time
of
the
reading
gazed
at
his
deli
cate
fingers
which
rapidly
twirled
by
its
cor
ners
a
gold
snuffbox
on
which
was
a
portrait
.
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
longest
sentences
he
stopped
the
rotary
motion
of
the
snuffbox
raised
his
head
and
with
inimical
politeness
lurking
in
the
corners
of
his
thin
lips
inter
rupted
weyrother
wishing
to
say
something
.
but
the
austrian
general
continuing
to
read
frowned
angrily
and
jerked
his
elbows
as
if
to
say
you
can
tell
me
your
views
later
but
now
be
so
good
as
to
look
at
the
map
and
listen
.
langeron
lifted
his
eyes
with
an
expression
of
perplexity
turned
round
to
milorddovich
as
if
seeking
an
explanation
but
meeting
the
lat
146
war
and
peace
ters
impressive
but
meaningless
gaze
drooped
his
eyes
sadly
and
again
took
to
twirling
his
snuffbox
.
a
geography
lesson
i

he
muttered
as
if
to
himself
but
loud
enough
to
be
heard
.
przebyszwski
with
respectful
but
dignified
politeness
held
his
hand
to
his
ear
toward
weyrother
with
the
air
of
a
man
absorbed
in
attention
.
dohktiirov
a
little
man
sat
opposite
weyrother
with
an
assiduous
and
modest
mien
and
stooping
over
the
outspread
map
conscientiously
studied
the
dispositions
and
the
unfamiliar
locality
.
he
asked
weyrother
several
times
to
repeat
words
he
had
not
clear
ly
heard
and
the
difficult
names
of
villages
.
weyrother
complied
and
dohkturov
noted
them
down
.
when
the
reading
which
lasted
more
than
an
hour
was
over
langeron
again
brought
his
snuffbox
to
rest
and
without
looking
at
wey
rother
or
at
anyone
in
particular
began
to
say
how
difficult
it
was
to
carry
out
such
a
plan
in
which
the
enemys
position
was
assumed
to
be
known
whereas
it
was
perhaps
not
known
since
the
enemy
was
in
movement
.
langeron
s
objections
were
valid
but
it
was
obvious
that
their
chief
aim
was
to
show
general
weyroth
er
who
had
read
his
dispositions
with
as
much
selfconfidence
as
if
he
were
addressing
school
children
that
he
had
to
do
not
with
fools
but
witlrmen
who
could
teach
him
something
in
military
matters
.
when
the
monotonous
sound
of
weyroth
ers
voice
ceased
kutuzov
opened
his
eye
as
a
miller
wakes
up
when
the
soporific
drone
of
the
mill
wheel
is
interrupted
.
he
listened
to
what
langeron
said
as
if
remarking
so
you
are
still
at
that
silly
business
quickly
closed
his
eye
again
and
let
his
head
sink
still
lower
.
langeron
trying
as
virulently
as
possible
to
sting
weyrothers
vanity
as
author
of
the
mili
tary
plan
argued
that
bonaparte
might
easily
attack
instead
of
being
attacked
and
so
render
the
whole
of
this
plan
perfectly
worthless
.
weyrother
met
all
objections
with
a
firm
and
contemptuous
smile
evidently
prepared
be
forehand
to
meet
all
objections
be
they
what
they
might
.
if
he
could
attack
us
he
would
have
done
so
today
said
he
.
so
you
think
he
is
powerless
said
langer
on
.
he
has
forty
thousand
men
at
most
re
plied
weyrother
with
the
smile
of
a
doctor
to
whom
an
old
wife
wishes
to
explain
the
treat
ment
of
a
case
.
in
that
case
he
is
inviting
his
doom
by
awaiting
our
attack
said
langeron
with
a
subtly
ironical
smile
again
glancing
round
for
support
to
milorddovich
who
was
near
him
.
but
milorddovich
was
at
that
moment
evi
dently
thinking
of
anything
rather
than
of
what
the
generals
were
disputing
about
.
ma
foil
said
he
tomorrow
we
shall
see
all
that
on
the
battlefield
.
weyrother
again
gave
that
smile
which
seemed
to
say
that
to
him
it
was
strange
and
ridiculous
to
meet
objections
from
russian
generals
and
to
have
to
prove
to
them
what
he
had
not
merely
convinced
himself
of
but
had
also
convinced
the
sovereign
emperors
of
.
the
enemy
has
quenched
his
fires
and
a
continual
noise
is
heard
from
his
camp
said
he
.
what
does
that
mean
either
he
is
retreat
ing
which
is
the
only
thing
we
need
fear
or
he
is
changing
his
position
.
he
smiled
iron
ically
.
but
even
if
he
also
took
up
a
position
in
the
thuerassa
he
merely
saves
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
all
our
arrangements
to
the
minutest
detail
remain
the
same
.
how
is
that

.

.

.
began
prince
andrew
who
had
for
long
been
waiting
an
opportunity
to
express
his
doubts
.
kutuzov
here
woke
up
coughed
heavily
and
looked
round
at
the
generals
.
gentlemen
the
dispositions
for
tomorrow
or
rather
for
today
for
it
is
past
midnight
cannot
now
be
altered
said
he
.
you
have
heard
them
and
we
shall
all
do
our
duty
.
but
before
a
battle
there
is
nothing
more
impor
tant

.

.

.
he
paused
than
to
have
a
good
sleep
.
he
moved
as
if
to
rise
.
the
generals
bowed
and
retired
.
it
was
past
midnight
.
prince
an
drew
went
out
.
the
council
of
war
at
which
prince
andrew
had
not
been
able
to
express
his
opinion
as
he
had
hoped
to
left
on
him
a
vague
and
uneasy
impression
.
whether
dolgoriikov
and
wey
rother
or
kutuzov
langeron
and
the
others
who
did
not
approve
of
the
plan
of
attack
were
right
he
did
not
know
.
but
was
it
really
not
possible
for
kutiizov
to
state
his
views
plainly
to
the
emperor
is
it
possible
that
on
account
of
court
and
personal
considerations
tens
of
thousands
of
lives
and
my
life
my
life
he
thought
must
be
risked
yes
it
is
very
likely
that
i
shall
be
killed
tomorrow
he
thought
.
and
suddenly
at
this
thought
of
death
a
whole
series
of
most
dis
tant
most
intimate
memories
rose
in
his
im
book
agination
he
remembered
his
last
parting
from
his
father
and
his
wife
he
remembered
the
days
when
he
first
loved
her
.
he
thought
of
her
pregnancy
and
felt
sorry
for
her
and
for
himself
and
in
a
nervously
emotional
and
sof
tened
mood
he
went
out
of
the
hut
in
which
he
was
billeted
with
nesvitski
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
before
it
.
the
night
was
foggy
and
through
the
fog
the
moonlight
gleamed
mysteriously
.
yes
tomor
row
tomorrow
he
thought
.
tomorrow
ev
erything
may
be
over
for
me
all
these
mem
ories
will
be
no
more
none
of
them
will
have
any
meaning
for
me
.
tomorrow
perhaps
even
certainly
i
have
a
presentiment
that
for
the
first
time
i
shall
have
to
show
all
i
can
do
.
and
his
fancy
pictured
the
battle
its
loss
the
concentration
of
fighting
at
one
point
and
the
hesitation
of
all
the
commanders
.
and
then
that
happy
moment
that
toulon
for
which
he
had
so
long
waited
presents
itself
to
him
at
last
.
he
firmly
and
clearly
expresses
his
opin
ion
to
kutuzov
to
weyrother
and
to
the
em
perors
.
all
are
struck
by
the
justness
of
his
views
but
no
one
undertakes
to
carry
them
out
so
he
takes
a
regiment
a
divisionstipu
lates
that
no
one
is
to
interfere
with
his
ar
rangementsleads
his
division
to
the
decisive
point
and
gains
the
victory
alone
.
but
death
and
suffering
suggested
another
voice
.
prince
andrew
however
did
not
answer
that
voice
and
went
on
dreaming
of
his
triumphs
.
the
dispositions
for
the
next
battle
are
planned
by
him
alone
.
nominally
he
is
only
an
adjutant
on
kutiizovs
staff
but
he
does
everything
alone
.
the
next
battle
is
won
by
him
alone
.
kutuzov
is
removed
and
he
is
appointed

.

.

.
well
and
then
asked
the
other
voice
.
if
before
that
you
are
not
ten
times
wounded
killed
or
betrayed
well

.

.

.
what
then

.

.

.
well
then
prince
andrew
answered
himself
i
dont
know
what
will
happen
and
dont
want
to
know
and
cant
but
if
i
want
this
want
glory
want
to
be
known
to
men
want
to
be
loved
by
them
it
is
not
my
fault
that
i
want
it
and
want
nothing
but
that
and
live
only
for
that
.
yes
for
that
alone
i
shall
never
tell
any
one
but
oh
god
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
love
nothing
but
fame
and
mens
esteem
death
wounds
the
loss
of
family
i
fear
nothing
.
and
precious
and
dear
as
many
persons
are
to
me
father
sister
wife
those
dearest
to
me
yet
dreadful
and
unnatural
as
it
seems
i
would
give
them
all
at
once
for
a
moment
of
glory
of
tri
umph
over
men
of
love
from
men
i
dont
know
and
never
shall
know
for
the
love
of
three
147
these
men
here
he
thought
as
he
listened
to
voices
in
kuttizovs
courtyard
.
the
voices
were
those
of
the
orderlies
who
were
packing
up
one
voice
probably
a
coachmans
was
teasing
kutiizovs
old
cook
whom
prince
andrew
knew
and
who
was
called
tit
.
he
was
saying
tit
i
say
tit
well
returned
the
old
man
.
go
tit
thresh
a
bit
said
the
wag
.
oh
go
to
the
devil
called
out
a
voice
drowned
by
the
laughter
of
the
orderlies
and
servants
.
all
the
same
i
love
and
value
nothing
but
triumph
over
them
all
i
value
this
mystic
pow
er
and
glory
that
is
floating
here
above
me
in
this
mist
chapter
xiii
that
same
night
rost6v
was
with
a
platoon
on
skirmishing
duty
in
front
of
bagrati6ns
detachment
.
his
hussars
were
placed
along
the
line
in
couples
and
he
himself
rode
along
the
line
trying
to
master
the
sleepiness
that
kept
coming
over
him
.
an
enormous
space
with
our
armys
campfires
dimly
glowing
in
the
fog
could
be
seen
behind
him
in
front
of
him
was
misty
darkness
.
rostov
could
see
nothing
peer
as
he
would
into
that
foggy
distance
now
some
thing
gleamed
gray
now
there
was
something
black
now
little
lights
seemed
to
glimmer
where
the
enemy
ought
to
be
now
he
fancied
it
was
only
something
in
his
own
eyes
.
his
eyes
kept
closing
and
in
his
fancy
appeared
now
the
emperor
now
denfsov
and
now
moscow
memories
and
he
again
hurriedly
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
close
before
him
the
head
and
ears
of
the
horse
he
was
riding
and
sometimes
when
he
came
within
six
paces
of
them
the
black
figures
of
hussars
but
in
the
distance
was
still
the
same
misty
darkness
.
why
not

..
.
it
might
easily
happen
thought
rost6v
that
the
emperor
will
meet
me
and
give
me
an
order
as
he
would
to
any
other
officer
hell
say
go
and
find
out
whats
there
.
there
are
many
stories
of
his
getting
to
know
an
officer
in
just
such
a
chance
way
and
attaching
him
to
himself
what
if
he
gave
me
a
place
near
him
oh
how
i
would
guard
him
how
i
would
tell
him
the
truth
how
i
would
unmask
his
deceiv
ers
and
in
order
to
realize
vividly
his
love
and
devotion
to
the
sovereign
rost6v
pictured
to
himself
an
enemy
or
a
deceitful
german
whom
he
would
not
only
kill
with
pleasure
but
whom
he
would
slap
in
the
face
before
the
emperor
.
suddenly
a
distant
shout
aroused
him
.
he
started
and
opened
his
eyes
.

and
peace
where
am

oh
yes
in

aft

.
what
a
nuisance
that
our
squadron
will
be
in
reserve
tomorrow
he
thought
.
ill
ask
leave
to
go
to
the
front
this
may
be
my
only
chance
of
see
ing
the
emperor
.
it
wont
be
long
now
before
i
am
off
duty
.
ill
take
another
turn
and
when
i
get
back
ill
go
to
the
general
and
ask
him
.
he
readjusted
himself
in
the
saddle
and
touched
up
his
horse
to
ride
once
more
round
his
hus
sars
.
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
getting
light
er
.
to
the
left
he
saw
a
sloping
descent
lit
up
and
facing
it
a
black
knoll
that
seemed
as
steep
as
a
wall
.
on
this
knoll
there
was
a
white
patch
that
rost6v
could
not
at
all
make
out
was
it
a
glade
in
the
wood
lit
up
by
the
moon
or
some
unmelted
snow
or
some
white
houses
he
even
thought
something
moved
on
that
white
spot
.
i
expect
its
snow

.

.

.
that
spot

..
.
a
spot
une

thought
.

.

.keep
to
theright
your
honor
there
are
bushes
here
came
the
voice
of
an
hussar
past
whom
rost6v
was
rid
ing
in
the
act
of
falling
asleep
.
rost6v
lifted
his
head
that
had
sunk
almost
to
his
horses
mane
and
pulled
up
beside
the
hussar
.
he
was
suc
cumbing
to
irresistible
youthful
childish
drow
siness
.
but
what
was
i
thinking
i
mustnt
for
get
.
how
shall
i
speak
to
the
emperor
no
thats
not
it
thats
tomorrow
.
oh
yes
natdsha

.

.

.
sabretache

.

.

.
saber
them

.

.

.
whom
the
hussars

.

.

.
ah
the
hussars
with
mustaches
.
along
the
tverskiya
street
rode
the
hussar
with
mustaches

..
.
i
thought
about
him
too
just
opposite
guryevs
house

.

.

.
old
guryev

.

.

.
oh
but
denfsovs
a
fine
fellow
.
but
thats
all
nonsense
.
the
chief
thing
is
that
the
em
peror
is
here
.
how
he
looked
at
me
and
wished
to
say
something
but
dared
not
no
it
was
i
who
dared
not
.
but
thats
nonsense
the
chief
thing
is
not
to
forget
the
important
thing
i
was
thinking
of
.
yes
natdsha
sabretache
oh
yes
yes
thats
right
and
his
head
once
more
sank
to
his
horses
neck
.
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
being
fired
at
.
what
what
what

.

.

.
cut
them
down
what

.

.

.
said
rost6v
waking
up
.
at
the
moment
he
opened
his
eyes
he
heard
in
front
of
him
where
the
enemy
was
the
longdrawn
shouts
of
thou
sands
of
voices
.
his
horse
and
the
horse
of
the
hussar
near
him
pricked
their
ears
at
these
shouts
.
over
there
where
the
shouting
came
from
a
fire
flared
up
and
went
out
again
then
another
and
all
along
the
french
line
on
the
hill
fires
flared
up
and
the
shouting
grew
loud
er
and
louder
.
rost6v
could
hear
the
sound
of
french
words
but
could
not
distinguish
them
.
the
din
of
many
voices
was
too
great
all
he
could
hear
was
ahahah
and
rrrr
whats
that
what
do
you
make
of
it
said
rost6v
to
the
hussar
beside
him
.
that
must
be
the
enemys
camp
the
hussar
did
not
reply
.
why
dont
you
hear
it
rost6v
asked
again
after
waiting
for
a
reply
.
who
can
tell
your
honor
replied
the
hus
sar
reluctantly
.
from
the
direction
it
must
be
the
enemy
repeated
rost6v
.
it
may
be
he
or
it
may
be
nothing
muttered
the
hussar
.
its
dark

.

.

.
steady
he
cried
to
his
fidgeting
horse
.
rost6vs
horse
was
also
getting
restive
it
pawed
the
frozen
ground
pricking
its
ears
at
the
noise
and
looking
at
the
lights
.
the
shout
ing
grew
still
louder
and
merged
into
a
general
roar
that
only
an
army
of
several
thousand
men
could
produce
.
the
lights
spread
farther
and
farther
probably
along
the
line
of
the
french
camp
.
rost6v
no
longer
wanted
to
sleep
.
the
gay
triumphant
shouting
of
the
enemy
army
had
a
stimulating
effect
on
him
.
vive
iempereur
vempereur
he
now
heard
distinctly
.
they
cant
be
far
off
probably
just
beyond
the
stream
he
said
to
the
hussar
beside
him
.
the
hussar
only
sighed
without
replying
and
coughed
angrily
.
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
approaching
at
a
trot
along
the
line
of
hussars
was
heard
and
out
of
the
foggy
darkness
the
figure
of
a
sergeant
of
hussars
suddenly
ap
peared
looming
huge
as
an
elephant
.
your
honor
the
generals
i
said
the
sergeant
riding
up
to
rost6v
.
rostov
still
looking
round
toward
the
fires
and
the
shouts
rode
with
the
sergeant
to
meet
some
mounted
men
who
were
riding
along
the
line
.
one
was
on
a
white
horse
.
prince
bagra
ti6n
and
prince
dolgorukov
with
their
adju
tants
had
come
to
witness
the
curious
phenom
enon
of
the
lights
and
shouts
in
the
enemys
camp
.
rost6v
rode
up
to
bagrati6n
reported
to
him
and
then
joined
the
adjutants
listen
ing
to
what
the
generals
were
saying
.
believe
me
said
prince
dolgorukov
ad
dressing
bagrati6n
it
is
nothing
but
a
trick
he
has
retreated
and
ordered
the
rearguard
to
kindle
fires
and
make
a
noise
to
deceive
us
.

evening
but
now
i
dont
know
your
excellency
.
shall
i
go
with
some
of
my
hussars
to
see
replied
rost6v
.
bagrati6n
stopped
and
before
replying
tried
to
see
rost6vs
face
in
the
mist
.
well
go
and
see
he
said
after
a
pause
.
yes
sir
.
rost6v
spurred
his
horse
called
to
sergeant
fddchenko
and
two
other
hussars
told
them
to
follow
him
and
trotted
downhill
in
the
direc
tion
from
which
the
shouting
came
.
he
felt
both
frightened
and
pleased
to
be
riding
alone
with
three
hussars
into
that
mysterious
and
dangerous
misty
distance
where
no
one
had
been
before
him
.
bagrati6n
called
to
him
from
the
hill
not
to
go
beyond
the
stream
but
ros
tdv
pretended
not
to
hear
him
and
did
not
stop
but
rodeon
and
on
continually
mistaking
bushes
for
trees
and
gullies
for
men
and
con
tinually
discovering
his
mistakes
.
having
de
scended
the
hill
at
a
trot
he
no
longer
saw
ei
ther
our
own
or
the
enemys
fires
but
heard
the
shouting
of
the
french
more
loudly
and
distinctly
.
in
the
valley
he
saw
before
him
something
like
a
river
but
when
he
reached
it
he
found
it
was
a
road
.
having
come
out
onto
the
road
he
reined
in
his
horse
hesitating
whether
to
ride
along
it
or
cross
it
and
ride
over
the
black
field
up
the
hillside
.
to
keep
to
the
road
which
gleamed
white
in
the
mist
would
have
been
safer
because
it
would
be
easier
to
see
people
coming
along
it
.
follow
me
said
he
crossed
the
road
and
began
rid
ing
up
the
hill
at
a
gallop
toward
the
point
where
the
french
pickets
had
been
standing
that
evening
.
your
honor
there
he
is
cried
one
of
the
hussars
behind
him
.
and
before
rost6v
had
time
to
make
out
what
the
black
thing
was
that
had
suddenly
appeared
in
the
fog
there
was
a
flash
followed
by
a
report
and
a
bullet
whizzing
high
up
in
the
mist
with
a
plaintive
sound
passed
out
of
hearing
.
another
musket
missed
fire
but
flashed
in
the
pan
.
rost6v
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
back
.
four
more
reports
followed
at
intervals
and
the
bullets
passed
somewhere
in
the
fog
singing
in
differ
ent
tones
.
rost6v
reined
in
his
horse
whose
spirits
had
risen
like
his
own
at
the
firing
and
went
back
at
a
footpace
.
well
some
more
some
more
a
merry
voice
was
saying
in
his
soul
.
but
no
more
shots
came
.
only
when
approaching
bagrati6n
did
ros
t6v
let
his
horse
gallop
again
and
with
his
hand
at
the
salute
rode
up
to
the
general
.
dolgorukov
was
still
insisting
that
the
french
had
retreated
and
had
only
lit
fires
to
deceive
us
.
what
does
that
prove
he
was
saying
as
rost6v
rode
up
.
they
might
rejreat
and
leave
the
pickets
.
its
plain
that
they
have
not
all
gone
yet
prince
said
bagration
.
wait
till
tomorrow
morning
well
find
out
everything
tomorrow
.
the
picket
is
still
on
the
hill
your
excel
lency
just
where
itwas
in
the
even
ing
report
ed
rostov
stooping
forward
with
his
hand
at
the
salute
and
unable
to
repress
the
smile
of
delight
induced
by
his
ride
and
especially
by
the
sound
of
the
bullets
.
very
good
very
good
said
bagrati6n
.
thank

.

emperor
thought
rost6v
.
thank
god
the
fires
and
shouting
in
the
enemys
army
were
occasioned
by
the
fact
that
while
napole
ons
proclamation
was
being
read
to
the
troops
the
emperor
himself
rode
round
his
bivouacs
.
the
soldiers
on
seeing
him
lit
wisps
of
straw
and
ran
after
him
shouting

they

with

do
not
break

on
the
plea

let
every

be
fully
imbued
with
the
thought
that

defeat
these

napoleon
chapter
xiv
at
five
in
the
morning
it
was
still
quite
dark
.
the
troops
of
the
center
the
reserves
and
ba
grati6ns
right
flank
had
not
yet
moved
but
on
the
left
flank
the
columns
of
infantry
cavalry
and
artillery
which
were
to
be
the
first
to
de
scend
the
heights
to
attack
the
french
right
flank
and
drive
it
into
the
bohemian
moun
tains
according
to
plan
were
already
up
and
astir
.
the
smoke
of
the
campfires
into
which
they
were
throwing
everything
superfluous
made
the
eyes
smart
.
it
was
cold
and
dark
.
the
officers
were
hurriedly
drinking
tea
and
break
fasting
the
soldiers
munching
biscuitand
beat
ing
a
tattoo
with
their
feet
to
warm
themselves
gathering
round
the
fires
throwing
into
the
flames
the
remains
of
sheds
chairs
tables
wheels
tubs
and
everything
that
they
did
not
want
or
could
not
carry
away
with
them
.
aus
trian
column
guides
were
moving
in
and
out
among
the
russian
troops
and
served
as
her
alds
of
the
advance
.
as
soon
as
an
austrian
of
ficer
showed
himself
near
a
commanding
offi
cers
quarters
the
regiment
began
to
move
the
soldiers
ran
from
the
fires
thrust
their
pipes
in
to
their
boots
their
bags
into
the
carts
got
their
muskets
ready
and
formed
rank
.
the
of
ficers
buttoned
up
their
coats
buckled
on
their
swords
and
pouches
and
moved
along
the
ranks
shouting
.
the
train
drivers
and
orderlies
har
nessed
and
packed
the
wagons
and
tied
on
the
loads
.
the
adjutants
and
battalion
and
regi
mental
commanders
mounted
crossed
them
selves
gave
final
instructions
orders
and
com
missions
to
the
baggage
men
who
remained
be
hind
and
the
monotonous
tramp
of
thousands
of
feet
resounded
.
the
column
moved
forward
without
knowing
where
and
unable
from
the
masses
around
them
the
smoke
and
the
increas
ing
fog
to
see
either
the
place
they
were
leav
ing
or
that
to
which
they
were
going
.
war
and
peace
a
soldier
on
the
march
is
hemmed
in
and
borne
along
by
his
regiment
as
much
as
a
sailor
is
by
his
ship
.
however
far
he
has
walked
whatever
strange
unknown
and
dangerous
places
he
reaches
just
as
a
sailor
is
always
sur
rounded
by
the
same
decks
masts
and
rigging
of
his
ship
so
the
soldier
always
has
around
him
the
same
comrades
the
same
ranks
the
same
sergeant
major
ivan
mitrich
the
same
company
dog
jack
and
the
same
commanders
.
the
sailor
rarely
cares
to
know
the
latitude
in
which
his
ship
is
sailing
but
on
the
day
of
bat
tleheaven
knows
how
and
whencea
stern
note
of
which
all
are
conscious
sounds
in
the
moral
atmosphere
of
an
army
announcing
the
approach
of
something
decisive
and
solemn
and
awakening
in
the
men
an
unusual
curios
ity
.
on
the
day
of
battle
the
soldiers
excitedly
try
to
get
beyond
the
interests
of
their
regiment
they
listen
intently
look
about
and
eagerly
ask
concerning
what
is
going
on
around
them
.
the
fog
had
grown
so
dense
that
though
it
was
growing
light
they
could
not
see
ten
paces
ahead
.
bushes
looked
like
gigantic
trees
and
level
ground
like
cliffs
and
slopes
.
anywhere
on
any
side
one
might
encounter
an
enemy
in
visible
ten
paces
off
.
but
the
columns
advanced
for
a
long
time
always
in
thesame
fog
descend
ing
and
ascending
hills
avoiding
gardens
and
enclosures
going
over
new
and
unknown
ground
and
nowhere
encountering
the
enemy
.
on
the
contrary
the
soldiers
became
aware
that
in
front
behind
and
on
all
sides
other
russian
columns
were
moving
in
the
same
di
rection
.
every
soldier
felt
glad
to
know
that
to
the
unknown
place
where
he
was
going
many
more
of
our
men
were
going
too
.
there
now
the
kiirskies
have
also
gone
past
was
being
said
in
the
ranks
.
its
wonderful
what
a
lot
of
our
troops
have
gathered
lads

last
night
i
looked
at
thecamp
fires
and
there
was
no
end
of
them
.
a
regular
moscow
1
though
none
of
the
column
commanders
rode
up
to
the
ranks
or
talked
to
the
men
the
commanders
as
we
saw
at
the
council
of
war
were
out
of
humor
and
dissatisfied
with
the
af
fair
and
so
did
not
exert
themselves
to
cheer
the
men
but
merely
carried
out
the
orders
yet
the
troops
marched
gaily
as
they
always
do
when
going
into
action
especially
to
an
attack
.
but
when
they
had
marched
for
about
an
hour
in
the
dense
fog
the
greater
part
of
the
men
had
to
halt
and
an
unpleasant
consciousness
of
some
dislocation
and
blunder
spread
through
the
ranks
.
how
such
a
consciousness
is
com
book
three
municated
is
very
difficult
to
define
but
it
cer
tainly
is
communicated
very
surely
and
flows
rapidly
imperceptibly
and
irrepressibly
as
water
does
in
a
creek
.
had
the
russian
army
been
alone
without
any
allies
it
might
perhaps
have
been
a
long
time
before
this
consciousness
of
mismanagement
became
a
general
convic
tion
but
as
it
was
the
disorder
was
readily
andnaturally
attributed
to
thestupid
germans
and
everyone
was
convinced
that
a
dangerous
muddle
had
been
occasioned
by
the
sausage
eaters
.
why
have
we
stopped
is
the
way
blocked
or
have
we
already
come
up
against
the
french
no
one
cant
hear
them
.
theyd
be
firing
if
we
had
.
they
were
in
a
hurry
enough
to
start
us
and
now
here
we
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
field
without
rhyme
or
reason
.
its
all
those
damned
germans
muddling
what
stupid
devils
yes
id
send
them
on
in
front
but
no
fear
theyre
crowding
up
behind
.
and
now
here
we
stand
hungry
.
i
say
shall
we
soon
be
clear
they
say
the
cavalry
are
blocking
the
way
said
an
officer
.
ah
those
damned
germans
they
dont
know
their
own
country
said
another
.
what
division
are
you
shouted
an
adju
tant
riding
up
.
the
eighteenth
.
then
why
are
you
here
you
should
have
gone
on
long
ago
now
you
wont
get
there
till
evening
.
what
stupid
orders
they
dont
themselves
know
what
they
are
doing
said
the
officer
and
rode
off
.
then
a
general
rode
past
shouting
something
angrily
not
in
russian
.
tafalafa
but
what
hes
jabbering
no
one
can
make
out
said
a
soldier
mimicking
the
general
who
had
ridden
away
.
id
shoot
them
the
scoundrels
we
were
ordered
to
be
at
the
place
before
nine
but
we
havent
got
halfway
.
fine
orders
was
being
repeated
on
different
sides
.
and
the
feeling
of
energy
with
which
the
troops
had
started
began
to
turn
into
vexation
and
anger
at
the
stupid
arrangements
and
at
the
germans
.
the
cause
of
the
confusion
was
that
while
the
austrian
cavalry
was
moving
toward
our
left
flank
the
higher
command
found
that
our
center
was
too
far
separated
from
our
right
flank
and
the
cavalry
were
all
ordered
to
turn
back
to
the
right
.
several
thousand
cavalry
crossed
in
front
of
the
infantry
who
had
to
wait
.
at
the
front
an
altercation
occurred
between
an
austrian
guide
and
a
russian
general
.
the
general
shouted
a
demand
that
the
cavalry
should
be
halted
the
austrian
argued
that
not
he
but
the
higher
command
was
to
blame
.
the
troops
meanwhile
stood
growing
listless
and
dispirited
.
after
an
hours
delay
they
at
last
moved
on
descending
the
hill
.
the
fog
that
was
dispersing
on
the
hill
lay
still
more
densely
below
where
they
were
descending
.
in
front
in
the
fog
a
shot
was
heard
and
then
an
other
at
first
irregularly
at
varying
intervals
trata

.

.

.
tat
and
then
more
and
more
regular
ly
and
rapidly
and
the
action
at
the
goldbach
stream
began
.
not
expecting
to
come
on
the
enemy
down
by
the
stream
and
having
stumbled
on
him
in
the
fog
hearing
no
encouraging
word
from
their
commanders
and
with
a
consciousness
of
being
too
late
spreading
through
the
ranks
and
above
all
being
unable
to
see
anything
in
front
or
around
them
in
the
thick
fog
the
russians
exchanged
shots
with
the
enemy
la
zily
and
advanced
and
again
halted
receiving
no
timely
orders
from
ttye
officers
or
adjutants
who
wandered
about
in
the
fog
in
those
un
known
surroundings
unable
to
find
their
own
regiments
.
in
this
way
the
action
began
for
the
first
second
and
third
columns
which
had
gone
down
into
the
valley
.
the
fourth
col
umn
with
which
kutiizov
was
stood
on
the
pratzen
heights
.
below
where
the
fight
was
beginning
there
was
still
thick
fog
on
the
higher
ground
it
was
clearing
but
nothing
could
be
seen
of
what
was
going
on
in
front
.
whether
all
the
enemy
forces
were
as
we
supposed
six
miles
away
or
whether
they
were
near
by
in
that
sea
of
mist
no
one
knew
till
after
eight
oclock
.
it
was
nine
oclock
in
the
morning
.
the
fog
lay
unbroken
like
a
sea
down
below
but
high
er
up
at
the
village
of
schlappanitz
where
na
poleon
stood
with
his
marshals
around
him
it
was
quite
light
.
above
him
was
a
clear
blue
sky
and
the
suns
vast
orb
quivered
like
a
huge
hol
low
crimson
float
on
the
surface
of
that
milky
sea
of
mist
.
the
whole
french
army
and
even
napoleon
himself
with
his
staff
were
not
on
the
far
side
of
the
streams
and
hollows
of
sok
olnitz
and
schlappanitz
beyond
which
we
in
tended
to
take
up
our
position
and
begin
the
action
but
were
on
this
side
so
close
to
our
own
forces
that
napoleon
with
the
naked
eye
could
distinguish
a
mounted
man
from
one
on
war
and
peace
foot
.
napoleon
in
the
blue
cloak
which
he
had
worn
on
his
italian
campaign
sat
on
his
small
gray
arab
horse
a
little
in
front
of
his
marshals
.
he
gazed
silently
at
the
hills
which
seemed
to
rise
out
of
the
sea
of
mist
and
on
which
the
russian
troops
were
moving
in
the
distance
and
he
listened
to
the
sounds
of
firing
in
the
valley
.
not
a
single
muscle
of
his
face
which
in
those
days
was
still
thin
moved
.
his
gleam
ing
eyes
were
fixed
intently
on
one
spot
.
his
predictions
were
being
justified
.
part
of
the
russian
force
had
already
descended
into
the
valley
toward
the
ponds
and
lakes
and
part
were
leaving
these
pratzen
heights
which
he
intended
to
attack
and
regarded
as
the
key
to
the
position
.
he
saw
over
the
mist
that
in
a
hol
low
between
two
hills
near
the
village
of
prat
zen
the
russian
columns
their
bayonets
glit
tering
were
moving
continuously
in
one
direc
tion
toward
the
valley
and
disappearing
one
after
another
into
the
mist
.
from
information
he
had
received
the
evening
before
from
the
sound
of
wheels
and
footsteps
heard
by
the
out
posts
during
the
night
by
the
disorderly
move
ment
of
the
russian
columns
and
from
all
in
dications
he
saw
clearly
that
the
allies
believed
him
to
be
far
away
in
front
of
them
and
that
the
columns
moving
near
pratzen
constituted
the
center
of
the
russian
army
and
that
that
center
was
already
sufficiently
weakened
to
be
successfully
attacked
.
but
still
he
did
not
begin
the
engagement
.
today
was
a
great
day
for
him
the
anniver
sary
of
his
coronation
.
before
dawn
he
had
slept
for
a
few
hours
and
refreshed
vigorous
and
in
good
spirits
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
out
into
the
field
in
that
happy
mood
in
which
every
thing
seems
possible
and
everything
succeeds
.
he
sat
motionless
looking
at
the
heights
visible
above
the
mist
and
his
cold
face
wore
that
special
look
of
confident
selfcom
placent
happiness
that
one
sees
on
the
face
of
a
boy
happily
in
love
.
the
marshals
stood
be

him
not
venturing
to
distract
his
atten
tion
.
he
looked
now
at
the
pratzen
heights
now
at
the
sun
floating
up
out
of
the
mist
.
when
the
sun
had
entirely
emerged
from
the
fog
and
fields
and
mist
were
aglow
with
dazzling
light
as
if
he
had
only
awaited
this
to
begin
the
action
he
drew
the
glove
from
his
shapely
white
hand
made
a
sign
with
it
to
the
marshals
and
ordered
the
action
to
begin
.
the
marshals
accompanied
by
adjutants
galloped
off
in
different
directions
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
chief
forces
of
the
french
army
moved
rapidly
toward
those
pratzen
heights
which
were
being
more
and
more
denuded
by

the

that
was
to
take
the
place
of
przeby

and

columns
which
had
already
gone
down
into

.
he
greeted
the
men
of
the
foremost
regiment
and
gave
them
the
order
to
march
thereby
indicating
that
he
intended
to
lead
that
column
himself
.
when
he
had
reached
the
village
of
pratzen
he
halted
.
prince
andrew
was
behind
among
the
immense
number
forming
the
commander
in
chiefs
suite
.
he
was
in
a
state
of
suppressed
ex
citement
and
irritation
though
controlledly
calm
as
a
man
is
at
the
approach
of
a
long
awaited
moment
.
he
was
firmly
convinced
that
this
was
the
day
of
his
toulon
or
his
bridge
of
arcola
.

how
it
would
come
about
he
did
not
know
but
he
felt
sure
it
would
do
so
.
the
lo
cality
and
the
position
of
our
troops
were
known
to
him
as
far
as
they
could
be
known
to
anyone
in
our
army
.
his
own
strategic
plan
which
obviously
could
not
now
be
carried
out
was
forgotten
.
now
entering
into
weyrothers
plan
prince
andrew
considered
possible
con
tingencies
and
formed
new
projects
such
as
might
call
for
his
rapidity
of
perception
and
decision
.
to
the
left
down
below
in
the
mist
the
mus
ketry
fire
of
unseen
forces
could
be
heard
.
it
was
there
prince
andrew
thought
the
fight
would
concentrate
.
there
we
shall
encounter
difficulties
and
there
thought
he
i
shall
be
sent
with
a
brigade
or
division
and
there
stand
ard
in
hand
i
shall
go
forward
and
break
what
ever
is
in
front
of
me
.
he
could
not
look
calmly
at
the
standards
of
the
passing
battalions
.
seeing
them
he
kept
thinking
that
may
be
the
very
standard
with
which
i
shall
lead
the
army
.
in
the
morning
all
that
was
left
of
the
night
mist
on
the
heights
was
a
hoar
frost
now
turn
ing
to

but
in
the

it
still
lay
like
a
milkwhite
sea
.
nothing
was
visible
in
the
val

to
the
left
into
which
our
troops
had
de
scended
and
from
whence
came
the
sounds
of

.
above

was
the

on

the

were
entering

with
a
sound
of
hoofs
and
wheels
and
now
and
then
a

similar

the

was
standing
at

letting

seemed

and

the

came
to

without

obstructed

he
said
angri
ly
to

who
had
ridden
up
.

you

laughed
bitterly
.

exclaimed
kutuzov
bit
terly
.

kindly

yes
sir

my
dear
fellow
nesvftski
whispered
to
prince
andrew
the
old
man
is
as
surly
as
a
dog
.
an
austrian
officer
in
a
white
uniform
with
green
plumes
in
his
hat
galloped
up
to
kutu
zov
and
asked
in
the
emperors
name
had
the
fourth
column
advanced
into
action
.
kutuzov
turned
round
without
answering
and
his
eye
happened
to
fall
upon
prince
an
drew
who
was
beside
him
.
seeing
him
kutu
zovs
malevolent
and
caustic
expression
sof
tened
as
if
admitting
that
what
was
being
done
was
not
his

fault
and
still
not

the

hardly
had
prince

started
than
he
stopped
him
.
and
ask
whether
sharpshooters
have
been
posted
he
added
.
what
are
they
doing
what

he
murmured
to
him
self
still
not
replying
to
the
austrian
.
prince
andrew
galloped
off
to
execute
the
order
.
overtaking
the
battalions
that
continued
to
advance
he
stopped
the
third
division
and
con
vinced
himself
that
there
really
were
no
sharp
shooters
in
front
of
our
columns
.
the
colonel
at
the
head
of
the
regiment
was
much
surprised
at
the
commander
in
chiefs
order
to
throw
out
skirmishers
.
he
had
felt
perfectly
sure
that
there
were
other
troops
in
front
of
him
and
that
the
enemy
must
be
at
least
six
miles
away
.
there
was
really
nothing
to
be
seen
in
front
except
a
barren
descent
hidden
by
dense
mist
.
having
given
orders
in
the
commander
in
chiefs
name
to
rectify
this
omission
prince
andrew
galloped
back
.
kutuzov
still
in
the
same
place
his
stout
body
resting
heavily
in
the
saddle
with
the
lassitude
of
age
sat
yawn
ing
wearily
with
closed
eyes
.
the
troops
were
no
longer
moving
but
stood
with
the
butts
of
their
muskets
on
the
ground
.
all
right
all
right
he
said
to
prince
an
drew
and
turned
to
a
general
who
watch
in
hand
was
saying
it
was
time
they
started
as
all
the
leftflank
columns
had
already
descended
.
plenty
of
time
your
excellency
muttered
kutuzov
in
the
midst
of
a
yawn
.
plenty
of
time
he
repeated
.
just
then
at
a
distance
behind
kutuzov
was
heard
the
sound
of
regiments
saluting
and
this
sound
rap
idly
came
nearer
along
the
whole
extended
line
of
the
advancing
russian
col
umns
.
evidently
the
person
they
were
greeting
was
riding
quickly
.
when
the
soldiers
of
the
regiment
in
front
of
which
kutuzov
was
stand
ing
began
to
shout
he
rode
a
little
to
one
side
and
looked
round
with
a
frown
.
along
the
road
from
pratzen
galloped
what
looked
like
a
squadron
of
horsemen
in
various
uniforms
.
two
of
them
rode
side
by
side
in
front
at
full
gallop
.
one
in
a
black
uniform
with
white
plumes
in
his
hat
rode
a
bobtailed
chestnut
horse
the
other
who
was
in
a
white
uniform
rode
a
black
one
.
these
were
the
two
emper
ors
followed
by
their
suites
.
kutuzov
affecting
the
manners
of
an
old
soldier
at
the
front
gave
the
command
attention
and
rode
up
to
the
emperors
with
a
salute
.
his
whole
ap
pearance
and
manner
were
suddenly
trans
formed
.
he
put
on
the
air
of
a
subordinate
who
obeys
without
reasoning
.
with
an
affecta
tion
of
respect
which
evidently
struck
alex
ander
unpleasantly
he
rode
up
and
saluted
.
this
unpleasant
impression
merely
flitted
over
the
young
and
happy
face
of
the
emperor

war
and
peace
like
a
cloud
of
haze
across
a
clear
sky
and
van
ished
.
after
his
illness
he
looked
rather
thin
ner
that
day
than
on
the
field
of
olmiitz
where
bolkonski
had
seen
him
for
the
first
time
abroad
but
there
was
still
the
same
bewitching
combination
of
majesty
and
mildness
in
his
fine
gray
eyes
and
on
his
delicate
lips
the
same
capacity
for
varying
expression
and
the
same
prevalent
appearance
of
goodhearted
innocent
youth
.
at
the
olmiitz
review
he
had
seemed
more
majestic
here
he
seemed
brighter
and
more
energetic
.
he
was
slightly
flushed
after
gallop
ing
two
miles
and
reining
in
his
horse
he
sighed
restfully
and
looked
round
at
the
faces
of
his
suite
young
and
animated
as
his
own
.

and

others
all
richly

gay
young
men
on

wellgroomed
fresh
only
slightly
heated
horses
exchanging
remarks
and
smiling
had
stopped
behind
the
emperor
.
the
emperor
francis
a
rosy
long
faced
young
man
sat
very
erect
on
his
hand
some
black
horse
looking
about
him
in
a
lei
surely
and
preoccupied
manner
.
he
beckoned
to
one
of
his
white
adjutants
and
asked
some
questionmost
likely
he
is
asking
at
what
oclock
they
started
thought
prince
andrew
watching
his
old
acquaintance
with
a
smile
he
could
not
repress
as
he
recalled
his
reception
at
brtinn
.
in
the
emperors
suite
were
the
picked
young
orderly
officers
of
the
guard
and
line
regiments
russian
and
austrian
.
among
them
were
grooms
leading
the
tsars
beautiful
relay
horses
covered
with
embroidered
cloths
.
as
when
a
window
is
opened
a
whiff
of
fresh
air
from
the
fields
enters
a
stuffy
room
so
a
whiff
of
youthfulness
energy
and
confidence
of
success
reached
kutuzovs
cheerless
staff
with
the
galloping
advent
of
all
these
brilliant
young
men
.

he
shrugged
his
rather
round
shoul
ders
and
glanced
at

was
near
him
as
if
complaining
of

the
tsar
with
another
glance
at
the
emperor

as
if
inviting
him
if
not
to
join
in
at
least
to
listen
to
what
he
was
saying

but
the
emperor

continued
to
look
about
him
and
did
not
listen

kutuzov
in
a
resounding
voice
apparently
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
not

and
again
something
in

face
twitched

clearly

though
he
may
be
he
should

he
certainly
should

their
glances
seemed
to

the
tsar
looked
intently
and
observantly
into
kutuzovs
eye
waiting
to
hear
whether
he
would
say
anything
more
.
but
kutuzov
with
respectfully
bowed
head
seemed
also
to
be
waiting
.
the
silence
lasted
for
about
a

kutiizov

his
head

again
assuming

tone

general

he
touched
his
horse
and
having
called

the
commander

gave
him

time
now
passing
so
gallantly
before
the
emperors
that
he
forgot
the
sovereigns
presence
.

its
not
the

had
to
take
cried
he
.
glad
to
do
our
best
shouted
the

.
the
emperors
horse
started
at
the
sudden
cry
.
this
horse
that
had
carried
the
sovereign
at
reviews
in
russia
bore
him
also
here
on
the
field
of
austerlitz
enduring
the
heedless
blows
of
his
left
foot
and
pricking
its
ears
at
the
sound
of
shots
just
as
it
had
done
on
the
empress
field
not
understanding
the
significance
of
the
fir
ing
nor
of
the
nearness
of
the
emperor
fran
cis
black
cob
nor
of
all
that
was
being
said
thought
and
felt
that
day
by
its
rider
.
the
emperor
turned
with
a
smile
to
one
of
his
followers
and
made
a
remark
to
him
point
ing
to
the
gallant
apsherons

chapter

kutizov
accompanied
by
his
adjutants
rode
at
a
walking
pace
behind
the
carabineers
.
when
he
had
gone
less
than
half
a
mile
in
the
rear
of
the
column
he
stopped
at
a
solitary
deserted
house
that
had
probably
once
been
an
inn
where
two
roads
parted
.
both
of
them
led
downhill
and
troops
were
marching
along
both
.
the
fog
had
begun
to
clear
and
enemy
troops
were
already
dimly
visible
about
a
mile
and
a
half
off
on
the
opposite
heights
.
down
below
on
the
left
the
firing
became
more
dis
tinct
.
kutiizov
had
stopped
and
was
speaking
to
an
austrian
general
.
prince
andrew
who
was
a
little
behind
and
looking
at
them
turned
to
an
adjutant
to
ask
him
for
a
field
glass
.
look
look
said
this
adjutant
looking
not
at
the
troops
in
the
distance
but
down
the
hill
before
him
.
its
the
french
the
two
generals
and
the
adjutant
took
hold
of
the
field
glass
trying
to
snatch
it
from
one
another
.
the
expression
on
all
their
faces
sud
denly
changed
to
one
of
horror
.
the
french
were
supposed
to
be
a
mile
and
a
half
away
but
had
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
appeared
just
in
front
of
us

but
how
is
that
said
dif
ferent
voices
.
with
the
naked
eye
prince
andrew
saw
be
low
them
to
the
right
not
more
than
five
hun
dred
paces
from
where
kutiizov
was
standing
a
dense
french
column
coining
up
to
meet
the
apsherons
.

here
it
is
the
decisive
moment
has
arrived
.
my
turn
has
come
thought
prince
andrew
and
striking
his
horse
he
rode
up
to
kutiizov
.
the
apsherons
must
be
stopped
your
ex
cellency
cried
he
.
but
at
that
very
instant
a
cloud
of
smoke
spread
all
round
firing
was
heard
quite
close
at
hand
and
a
voice
of
naive
terror
barely
two
steps
from
prince
andrew
shouted
brothers
alls
lost
and
at
this
voice
as
if
at
a
command
everyone
began
to
run
.
confused
and
everincreasing
crowds
were
running
back
to
where
five
minutes
before
the
troops
had
passed
the
emperors
.
not
only
would
it
have
been
difficult
to
stop
that
crowd
it
was
even
impossible
not
to
be
carried
back
with
it
oneself
.
bolk6nski
only
tried
not
to
lose
touch
with
it
and
looked
around
bewildered
and
unable
to
grasp
what
was
happening
in
front
of
him
.
nesvftski
with
an
angry
face
red
and
unlike
himself
was
shouting
to
kutiizov
that
if
he
did
not
ride
away
at
once
he
would
certainly
be
taken
prisoner
.
kutiizov
remained
in
the
same
place
and
without
answering
drew
out
a
handkerchief
.
blood
was
flowing
from
his
cheek
.
prince
andrew
forced
his
way
to
him
.
you
are
wounded
he
asked
hardly
able
to
master
the
trembling
of
his
lower
jaw
.
the
wound
is
not
here
it
is
there
said
kutiizov
pressing
the
handkerchief
to
his
wounded
cheek
and
pointing
to
the
fleeing
soldiers
.
stop
them
he
shouted
and
at
the
same
moment
probably
realizing
that
it
was
impossible
to
stop
them
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
to
the
right
.
a
fresh
wave
of
the
flying
mob
caught
him
and
bore
him
back
with
it
.
the
troops
were
running
in
such
a
dense
mass
that
once
surrounded
by
them
it
was
dif
ficult
to
get
out
again
.

was
shouting

round
and

by
a

kutiizov

more
than

prince
andrew
trying
to
keep
near
kutuzov
saw
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
amid
the
smoke
a
russian
battery
that
was
still
firingand
french
men
running
toward
it
.
higher
up
stood
some
russian
infantry
neither
moving
forward
to
protect
the
battery
nor
backward
with
the
flee
ing
crowd
.
a
mounted
general
separated
him
self
from
the
infantry
and
approached
kuttizov
.
of
kutrizovs
suite
only
four
remained
.
they
were
all
pale
and
exchanged
looks
in
silence
.

gasped
kutuzov
to
the
regimental
commander
pointing
to
the
flying
soldiers
but
at
that
instant
as
if
to
pun
ish
him
for
those
words
bullets
flew
hissing
across
the
regiment
and
across
kutiizovs
suite
like
a
flock
of
little
birds
.
the
french
had
attacked
the
battery
and
seeing
kutuzov
were
firing
at
him
.
after
this
volley
the
regimental
commander
clutched
at
his
leg
several
soldiers
fell
and
a
second
lieu
tenant
who
was
holding
the
flag
let
it
fall
from
his
hands
.
it
swayed
and
fell
but
caught
on
the
muskets
of
the
nearest
soldiers
.
the
soldiers
started
firing
without
orders

whispered
his
voice

from
a
con
sciousness
of
the
feebleness
of

bolk6nski


he
whispered
pointing
to
the
disordered
bat
talion
and
at
the
enemy
whats
that
but
before
he
had
finished
speaking
prince
andrew
feeling
tears
of
shame
and
anger
choking
him
had
already
leapt
from
his
horse
and
run
to
the
standard
.
forward
lads
he
shouted
in
a
voice
pierc
ing
as
a
childs
.
here
it
is
thought
he
seizing
the
staff
of
the
standard
and
hearing
with
pleasure
the
whistle
of
bullets
evidently
aimed
at
him
.
sev
eral
soldiers
fell
.
hurrah
shouted
prince
andrew
and
scarcely
able
to
hold
up
the
heavy
standard
he
ran
forward
with
full
confidence
that
the
whole
battalion
would
follow
him
.
and
really
he
only
ran
a
few
steps
alone
.
one
soldier
moved
and
then
another
and
soon
the
whole
battalion
ran
forward
shouting
hur
rah
and
overtook
him
.
a
sergeant
of
the
bat
talion
ran
up
and
took
the
flag
that
was
sway
ing
from
its
weight
in
prince
andrews
hands
but
he
was
immediately
killed
.
prince
andrew
again
seized
the
standard
and
dragging
it
by
the
staff
ran
on
with
the
battalion
.
in
front
he
saw
our
artillerymen
some
of
whom
were
fight
ing
while
others
having
abandoned
theirguns
were
running
toward
him
.
he
also
saw
french
infantry
soldiers
who
were
seizing
the
artillery
horses
and
turning
the
guns
round
.
prince
an
drew
and
the
battalion
were
already
within
twenty
paces
of
the
cannon
.
he
heard
the
whis
tle
of
bullets
above
him
unceasingly
and
to
right
and
left
of
him
soldiers
continually
groaned
and
dropped
.
but
he
did
not
look
at
them
he
looked
only
at
what
was
going
on
in
front
of
him
at
the
battery
.
he
now
saw
clear
ly
the
figure
of
a
redhaired
gunner
with
his
shako
knocked
awry
pulling
one
end
of
a
mop
while
a
french
soldier
tugged
at
the
other
.
he
could
distinctly
see
the
distraught
yet
angry
expression
on
the
faces
of
these
two
men
who
evidently
did
not
realize
what
they
were
doing
.
what
are
they
about
thought
prince
an
drew
as
he
gazed
at
them
.
why
doesnt
the
redhaired
gunner
run
away
as
he
is
unarmed
why
doesnt
the
frenchman
stab
him
he
will
not
get
away
before
the
frenchman
remembers
his
bayonet
and
stabs
him
.

.

.

.
and
really
another
french
soldier
trailing
his
musket
ran
up
to
the
struggling
men
and
the
fate
of
the
redhaired
gunner
who
had
tri
umphantly
secured
the
mop
and
still
did
not
realize
what
awaited
him
was
about
to
be
de
cided
.
but
prince
andrew
did
not
see
how
it
ended
.
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
one
of
the
soldiers
near
him
hit
him
on
the
head
with
the
full
swing
of
a
bludgeon
.
it
hurt
a
little
but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
pain
distracted
him
and
prevented
his
seeing
what
he
had
been
looking
at
.
whats
this
am
i
falling
my
legs
are
giv
ing
way
thought
he
and
fell
on
his
back
.
he
opened
his
eyes
hoping
to
see
how
the
strug
gle
of
the
frenchmen
with
the
gunners
ended
whether
the
redhaired
gunner
had
been
killed
or
not
and
whether
the
cannon
had
been
cap
tured
or
saved
.
but
he
saw
nothing
.
above
him
there
was
now
nothing
but
the
sky
the
lofty
sky
not
clear
yet
still
immeasurably
lofty
with
gray
clouds
gliding
slowly
across
it
.
how
quiet
peaceful
and
solemn
notat
all
as
i
ran
thought
prince
andrew
not
as
we
ran
shout
ing
and
fighting
not
at
all
as
the
gunner
and
the
frenchman
with
frightened
and
angry
faces
struggled
for
the
mop
how
differently
do
those
clouds
glide
across
that
lofty
infinite
sky
how
was
it
i
did
not
see
that
lofty
sky
before
and
how
happy
i
am
to
have
found
it
at
last
yes
all
is
vanity
all
falsehood
except
that
in
finite
sky
.
there
is
nothing
nothing
but
that
.
but
even
it
does
not
exist
there
is
nothing
but
quiet
and
peace
.

on
our
right
flank
commanded
by
bagrati6n
at
nine
oclock
the
battle
had
not
yet
begun
.
not
wishing
to
agree
to
dolgorukovs
demand
to
commence
the
action
and
wishing
to
avert
responsibility
from
himself
prince
bagrati6n
proposed
to
dolgorukov
to
send
to
inquire
of
the
commander
in
chief
.
bagrati6n
knew
that
as
the
distance
between
the
two
flanks
was
more
than
six
miles
even
if
the
messenger
were
not
killed
which
he
very
likely
would
be
and
found
the
commander
in
chief
which
would
be
very
difficult
he
would
not
be
able
to
get
back
before
evening
.
bagrati6n
cast
his
large
expressionless
sleepy
eyes
round
his
suite
and
the
boyish
face
of
ros
tov
breathless
with
excitement
and
hope
was
the
first
to
catch
his
eye
.
he
sent
him
.
and
if
i
should
meet
his
majesty
before
i
meet
the
commander
in
chief
your
excellency
said
rost6v
with
his
hand
to
his
cap
.
you
can
give
the
message
to
his
majesty
said
dolgorukov
hurriedly
interrupting
ba
grati6n
.
on
being
relieved
from
picket
duty
rost6v
had
managed
to
get
a
few
hours
sleep
before
morning
and
felt
cheerful
bold
and
resolute
with
elasticity
of
movement
faith
in
his
good
fortune
and
generally
in
that
state
of
mind
which
makes
everything
seem
possible
pleas
ant
and
easy
.
all
his
wishes
were
being
fulfilled
that
morn
ing
there
was
to
be
a
general
engagement
in
which
he
was
taking
part
more
than
that
he
was
orderly
to
the
bravest
general
and
still
more
he
was
going
with
a
message
to
kutiizov
perhaps
even
to
the
sovereign
himself
.
the
morning
was
bright
he
had
a
good
horse
under
him
and
his
heart
was
full
of
joy
and
happi
ness
.
on
receiving
the
order
he
gave
his
horse
the
rein
and
galloped
along
the
line
.
at
first
he
rode
along
the
line
of
bagrati6ns
troops
which
had
not
yet
advanced
into
action
but
were
standing
motionless
then
he
came
to
the
region
occupied
by
uvarovs
cavalry
and
here
he
noticed
a
stir
and
signs
of
preparation
for
battle
having
passed
uvarovs
cavalry
he
clear
ly
heard
the
sound
of
cannon
and
musketry
ahead
of
him
.
the
firing
grew
louder
and
loud
er
.
in
the
fresh
morning
air
were
now
heard
not
two
or
three
musket
shots
at
irregular
in
tervals
as
before
followed
by
one
or
two
can
non
shots
but
a
roll
of
volleys
of
musketry
from
the
slopes
of
the
hill
before
pratzen
in
terrupted
by
such
frequent
reports
of
cannon
that
sometimes
several
of
them
were
not
sep
arated
from
one
another
but
merged
into
a
general
roar
.
he
could
see
puffs
of
musketry
smoke
that
seemed
to
chase
one
another
down
the
hill
sides
and
clouds
of
cannon
smoke
rolling
spreading
and
mingling
with
one
another
.
he
could
also
by
the
gleam
of
bayonets
visible
through
the
smoke
make
out
moving
masses
of
infantry
and
narrow
lines
of
artillery
with
green
caissons
.
rost6v
stopped
his
horse
for
a
moment
on
a
hillock
to
see
what
was
going
on
but
strain
his
attention
as
he
would
he
could
not
understand
or
make
out
anything
of
what
was
happening
there
in
the
smoke
men
of
some
sort
were
mov
ing
about
and
in
front
and
behind
moved
lines
of
troops
but
why
whither
and
who
they
were
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
.
these
sights
and
sounds
had
no
depressing
or
intimidating
ef
fect
on
him
on
the
contrary
they
stimulated
his
energy
and
determination
.
go
on
go
on
give
it
them
he
mentally
exclaimed
at
these
sounds
and
again
proceed
ed
to
gallop
along
the
line
penetrating
farther
and
farther
into
the
region
where
the
army
was
already
in
action
.
how
it
will
be
there
i
dont
know
but
all
will
be
well
thought
rost6v
.
after
passing
some
austrian
troops
he
no
ticed
that
the
next
part
of
the
line
the
guards
was
already
in
action
.
so
much
the
better
i
shall
see
it
close
he
thought
.
he
was
riding
almost
along
the
front
line
.
a
handful
of
men
came
galloping
toward
him
.
they
were
our
uhlans
who
with
disordered
ranks
were
returning
from
the
attack
.
rost6v
got
out
of
their
way
involuntarily
noticed
that
one
of
them
was
bleeding
and
galloped
on
.
that
is
no
business
of
mine
he
thought
.
he
had
not
ridden
many
hundred
yards
after
that
before
he
saw
to
his
left
across
the
whole
width
of
the
field
an
enormous
mass
of
caval
ry
in
brilliant
white
uniforms
mounted
on
black
horses
trotting
straight
toward
him
and
across
his
path
.
rostov
put
his
horse
to
full
gallop
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
these
men
and
he
would
have
got
clear
had
they
continued
at
the
same
speed
but
they
kept
increasing
their
pace
so
that
some
of
the
horses
were
already
galloping
.
rost6v
heard
the
thud
of
their
hoofs
and
the
jingle
of
their
weapons
and
saw
their
horses
their
figures
and
even
their
faces
more
and
more
distinctly
.
they
were
our
horse
guards
advancing
to
attack
the
french
war
and
peace
cavalry
that
was
coming
to
meet
them
.
the
horse
guards
were
galloping
but
still
holding
in
their
horses
.
rost6v
could
already
see
their
faces
and
heard
the
command
charge
shouted
by
an
officer
who
was
urging
his
thoroughbred
to
full
speed
.
rost6v
fearing
to
be
crushed
or
swept
into
the
attack
on
the
french
galloped
along
the
front
as
hard
as
his
horse
could
go
but
still
was
not
in
time
to
avoid
them
.
the
last
of
the
horse
guards
a
huge
pock
marked
fellow
frowned
angrily
on
seeing
ros
t6v
before
him
with
whom
he
would
inevita
bly
collide
.
this
guardsman
would
certainly
have
bowled
rost6v
and
his
bedouin
over
rost6v
felt
himself
quite
tiny
and
weak
com
pared
to
these
gigantic
men
and
horses
had
it
not
occurred
to
rost6v
to
flourish
his
whip
be
fore
the
eyes
of
the
guardsmans
horse
.
the
heavy
black
horse
sixteen
hands
high
shied
throwing
back
its
ears
but
the
pockmarked
guardsman
drove
his
huge
spurs
in
violently
and
the
horse
flourishing
its
tail
and
extending
its
neck
galloped
on
yet
faster
.
hardly
had
the
horse
guards
passed
rost6v
before
he
heard
them
shout
hurrah
and
looking
back
saw
that
their
foremost
ranks
were
mixed
up
with
some
foreign
cavalry
with
red
epaulets
prob
ably
french
.
he
could
see
nothing
more
for
immediately
afterwards
cannon
began
firing
from
somewhere
and
smoke
enveloped
every
thing
.
at
that
moment
as
the
horse
guards
hav
ing
passed
him
disappeared
in
the
smoke
ros
t6v
hesitated
whether
to
gallop
after
them
or
to
go
where
he
was
sent
.
this
was
the
brilliant
charge
of
the
horse
guards
that
amazed
the
french
themselves
.
rost6v
was
horrified
to
hear
later
that
of
all
that
mass
of
huge
and
handsome
men
of
all
those
brilliant
rich
youths
officers
and
cadets
who
had
galloped
past
him
on
their
thousandruble
horses
only
eighteen
were
left
after
the
charge
.
why
should
i
envy
them
my
chance
is
not
lost
ancunaybe
i
shall
see
the
emperor
imme
diately
thojught
rost6v
and
galloped
on
.
when
he
came
level
with
the
foot
guards
he
noticed
that
about
them
and
around
them
cannon
balls
were
flying
of
which
he
was
aware
not
so
much
because
he
heard
their
sound
as
because
he
saw
uneasiness
on
the
sol
diers
faces
and
unnatural
warlike
solemnity
on
those
of
the
officers
.
passing
behind
one
of
the
lines
of
a
regiment
of
foot
guards
he
heard
a
voice
calling
him
by
name
.
rost6v
what
he
answered
not
recognizing
boris
.
i
say
weve
been
in
the
front
line
our
reg
iment
attacked
said
boris
with
the
happy
smile
seen
on
the
faces
of
young
men
who
have
been
under
fire
for
the
first
time
.
rost6v
stopped
.
have
you
he
said
.
well
how
did
it
go
we
drove
them
back
said
boris
with
an
imation
growing
talkative
.
can
you
imagine
it
and
he
began
describing
how
the
guards
having
taken
up
their
position
and
seeing
troops
before
them
thought
they
were
austri
ans
and
all
at
once
discovered
from
the
cannon
balls
discharged
by
those
troops
that
they
were
themselves
in
the
front
line
and
had
unexpect
edly
to
go
into
action
.
rostcw
without
hearing
boris
to
the
end
spurred
his
horse
.
where
are
you
off
to
asked
boris

with
a
message
to

there

is

rost6v
had
said
his
highness
and
pointing
to
the
grand

who
with
his
high
shoulders
and
frowning
brows
stood
a
hundred
paces
away
from
them
in
his
helmet
and
horse
guards

shouting
something
to
a
pale
white
uniformed
austrian
officer
.

he
said
something

but
rost6v
did
not

to
hear
it
and
rode
away
.
having
passed
the
guards
and
traversed
an
empty
space
rostov
to
avoid
again
getting
in

of
the
first
line
as
he
had
done
when
the
horse

charged
followed
the
line
of
reserves
going
far
round
the
place
where
the
hottest
musket
fire
and
cannonade
were
heard
.
suddenly
he
heard
musket
fire
quite
close
in
front
of
him
and
behind
our
troops
where
he
could
never
have
expected
the
enemy
to
be
.
what
can
it
be
he
thought
.
the
enemy
in

of

army
impossible
and
sud
denly
he
was
seized
by
a
panic
of
fear
for
him
self
and
for
the
issue
of
the
whole
battle
.
but
be
that
what
it
may

reflected
there
is
no

round
it
now
.
i
must
look
for

if
all
is

it
is
for

to

but
neither
they
nor
a
single
commanding
of

were
there
only
disorganized
crowds
of
troops
of
various
kinds

he
urged
on
his
al
ready
weary
horse
to
get
quickly
past
these
crowds
but
the
farther
he
went
the
more
dis
organized
they
were
.
the

on

with

russian

some

and

the

said
the

pointing

and
he
walked

talking

said
an

.
where
is
he
to
go
that
way

.
rost6v
considered
and
then
went
in
the
di
rection
where
they
said
he
would
be
killed
.
its
all
the
same
now
.
if
the
emperor
i
i6o
war
and
peace
wounded
am
i
to
try
to
save
myself
he
thought
.
he
rode
on
to
the
region
where
the
greatest
number
of
men
had
perished
in
flee
ing
from
pratzen
.
the
french
had
not
yet
oc
cupied
that
region
and
the
russians
the
un
injured
and
slightly
woundedhad
left
it
long
ago
.
all
about
the
field
like
heaps
of
manure
on
wellkept
plowland
lay
from
ten
to
fifteen
dead
and
wounded
to
each
couple
of
acres
.
the
wounded
crept
together
in
twos
and
threes
and
one
could
hear
their
distressing
screams
and
groans
sometimes
feigned
or
so
it
seemed
to
rost6v
.
he
put
his
horse
to
a
trot
to
avoid
see
ing
all
these
suffering
men
and
he
felt
afraid
afraid
not
for
his
life
but
for
the
courage
he
needed
and
which
he
knew
would
not
stand
the
sight
of
these
unfortunates
.
the
french
who
had
ceased
firing
at
this
field
strewn
with
dead
and
wounded
where
there
was
no
one
left
to
fire
at
on
seeing
an
adjutant
riding
over
it
trained
a
gun
on
him
and
fired
several
shots
.
the
sensation
of
those
terrible
whistling
sounds
and
of
the
corpses
around
him
merged
in
rost6vs
mind
into
a
single
feeling
of
terror
and
pity
for
himself
.
he
remembered
his
mothers
last
letter
.
what
would
she
feel
thought
he
if
she
saw
me
here
now
on
this
field
with
the
cannon
aimed
at
me
in
the
village
of
hosjeradek
there
were
rus
sian
troops
retiring
from
the
field
of
battle
who
though
still
in
some
confusion
were
less
disordered
.
the
french
cannon
did
not
reach
there
and
the
musketry
fire
sounded
far
away
.
here
everyone
clearly
saw
and
said
that
the
battle
was
lost
.
no
one
whom
rost6v
asked
could
tell
him
where
the
emperor
or
kuttizov
was
.
some
said
the
report
that
the
emperor
was
wounded
was
correct
others
that
it
was
not
and
explained
the
false
rumor
that
had
spread
by
the
fact
that
the
emperors
carriage
had
really
galloped
from
the
field
of
battle
with
the
pale
and
terrified
oberhofmarschal
count
tolst6y
who
had
ridden
out
to
the
bat
tlefield
with
others
in
the
emperors
suite
.
one
officer
told
rost6v
that
he
had
seen
someone
from
headquarters
behind
the
village
to
the
left
and
thither
rost6v
rode
not
hoping
to
find
anyone
but
merely
to
ease
his
conscience
.
when
he
had
ridden
about
two
miles
and
had
passed
the
last
of
the
russian
troops
he
saw
near
a
kitchen
garden
with
a
ditch
round
it
two
men
on
horseback
facing
the
ditch
.
one
with
a
white
plume
in
his
hat
seemed
familiar
to
rostov
the
other
on
a
beautiful
chestnut
horse
which
rost6v
fancied
he
had
seen
be
fore
rode
up
to
the
ditch
struck
his
horse
with
his
spurs
and
giving
it
the
rein
leaped
lightly
over
.
only
a
little
earth
crumbled
from
the
bank
under
the
horses
hind
hoofs
.
turning
the
horse
sharply
he
again
jumped
the
ditch
and
deferentially
addressed
the
horseman
with
the
white
plumes
evidently
suggesting
that
he
should
do
the
same
.
the
rider
whose
figure
seemed
familiar
to
rost6v
and
involuntarily
riveted
his
attention
made
a
gesture
of
refusal
with
his
head
and
hand
and
by
that
gesture
rost6v
instantly
recognized
his
lamented
and
adored
monarch
.
but
it
cant
be
he
alone
in
the
midst
of
this
empty
field
1
thought
rost6v
.
at
that
moment
alexander
turned
his
head
and
rost6v
saw
the
beloved
features
that
were
so
deeply
engraved
on
his
memory
.
the
emperor
was
pale
his
cheeks
sunken
and
his
eyes
hollow
but
the
charm
the
mildness
of
his
features
was
all
the
greater
.
rost6v
was
happy
in
the
assurance
that
the
rumors
about
the
emperor
being
wounded
were
false
.
he
was
happy
to
be
see
ing
him
.
he
knew
that
he
might
and
even
ought
to
go
straight
to
him
and
give
the
message
dol
gorukov
had
ordered
him
to
deliver
.
but
as
a
youth
in
love
trembles
is
unnerved
and
dares
not
utter
the
thoughts
he
has
dreamed
of
for
nights
but
looks
around
for
help
or
a
chance
of
delay
and
flight
when
the
longedfor
moment
comes
and
he
is
alone
with
her
so
rost6v
now
that
he
had
attained
what
he
had
longed
for
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
did
not
know
how
to
approach
the
em
peror
and
a
thousand
reasons
occurred
to
him
why
it
would
be
inconvenient
unseemly
and
impossible
to
do
so
.
what
i
it
is
as
if
i
were
glad
of
a
chance
to
take
advantage
of
his
being
alone
and
de
spondent
a
strange
face
may
seem
unpleasant
or
painful
to
him
at
this
moment
of
sorrow
besides
what
can
i
say
to
him
now
when
my
heart
fails
me
and
my
mouth
feels
dry
at
the
mere
sight
of
him
not
one
of
the
innumer
able
speeches
addressed
to
the
emperor
that
he
had
composed
in
his
imagination
could
he
now
recall
.
those
speeches
were
intended
for
quite
other
conditions
they
were
for
the
most
part
to
be
spoken
at
a
moment
of
victory
and
triumph
generally
when
he
was
dying
of
wounds
and
the
sovereign
had
thanked
him
for
heroic
deeds
and
while
dying
he
expressed
the
love
his
actions
had
proved
.
besides
how
can
i
ask
the
emperor
for
his

decided
and
sorrowfully
and
with
a
heart
full
of
despair
he
rode
away
continually
looking
back
at
the
tsar
who
still
remained
in
the
same
attitude
of
indecision
.
while
rost6v
was
thus
arguing
with
him
self
and
riding
sadly
away
captain
von
toll
chanced
to
ride
to
the
same
spot
and
seeing
the
emperor
at
once
rode
up
to
him
offered
his
services
and
assisted
him
to
cross
the
ditch
on
foot
.
the
emperor
wishing
to
rest
and
feel
ing
unwell
sat
down
under
an
apple
tree
and
von
toll
remained
beside
him
.
rost6v
from
a
distance
saw
with
envy
and
remorse
how
von
toll
spoke
long
and
warmly
to
the
emperor
and
how
the
emperor
evidently
weeping
cov
ered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
pressed
von

hand
.
and
i
might
have
been
in

rostov
and
hardly
restraining
his
tears
of
pity
for
the
emperor
he
rode
on
in
utter
despair
not
knowing
where
to
or
why
he
was
now
riding
.
his
despair
was
all
the
greater
from
feeling
that
his
own
weakness
was
the
cause
of
his
grief
.

might

not

might
but
should
have
gone
up
to
the
sovereign
.
it
was
a
unique
chance
to
show
his
devotion
to
the
emperor
and
he
had
not
made
use
of
it
what
have
i
done
thought
he
.
and
he
turned
round
and
galloped
back
to
the
place
where
he
had
seen
the
emperor
but
there
was
no
one

only
some
carts
and

were
passing
by

one
of

turned

of

from

running

moved

the

in

were

chapter

on
the
pratzen
heights
where
he
had
fallen
with
the
flagstaff
in
his
hand
lay
prince
an
drew
bolk6nski
bleeding
profusely
and
un
consciously
uttering
a
gentle
piteous
and
childlike
moan
.
toward
evening
he
ceased
moaning
and
be
came
quite
still
.
he
did
not
know
how
long
his
unconsciousness
lasted
.
suddenly
he
again
felt
that
he
was
alive
and
suffering
from
a
burn
ing
lacerating
pain
in
his
head
.
where
is
it
that
lofty
sky
that
i
did
not
know
till
now
but
saw
today
was
his
first
thought
.
and
i
did
not
know
this
suffering
either
he
thought
.
yes
i
did
not
know
any
thing
anything
at
all
till
now
.
but
where
am
i
he
listened
and
heard
the
sound
of
approach
ing
horses
and
voices
speaking
french
.
he
opened
his
eyes
.
above
him
again
was
the
same
lofty
sky
with
clouds
that
had
risen
and
were
floating
still
higher
and
between
them
gleamed
blue
infinity
.
he
did
not
turn
his
head
and
did
not
see
those
who
judging
by
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
voices
had
ridden
up
and
stopped
near
him
.
it
was
napoleon
accompanied
by
two
aides
decamp
.
bonaparte
riding
over
the
battlefield
had
given
final
orders
to
strengthen
the
bat
teries
firing
at
the
augesd
dam
and
was
look
ing
at
the
killed
and
wounded
left
on
the

.
fine
men
remarked
napoleon
looking
at
a
dead
russian
grenadier
who
with
his
face
buried
in
the
ground
and
a
blackened
nape
lay
on
his
stomach
with
an
already
stiffened
arm
flung
wide
.

have
some
brought
from
the
reserve
said
napoleon
and
having
gone
on
a
few
steps
he
stopped
before
prince
andrew
who
lay
on
his
back
with
the
flagstaff
that
had
been
dropped
beside
him
.
the
flag
had
already
been
taken
by
the
french
as
a
trophy
.
thats
a
fine
death
said
napoleon
as
he
gazed
at
bolk6nski
.
prince
andrew
understood
that
this
was
said
of
him
and
that
it
was
napoleon
who
said
it
.
he
heard
the
speaker
addressed
as
sire
.
but
he
heard
the
words
as
he
might
have
heard
the
buzzing
of
a
fly
.
not
only
did
they
not
interest
him
but
he
took
no
notice
of
them
and
at
once
forgot
them
.
his
head
was
burning
he
felt
himself
bleeding
to
death
and
he
saw
above
him
the
remote
lofty
and
everlasting
sky
.
he
knew
it
was
napoleon
his
hero
but
at
that
moment
napoleon
seemed
to
him
such
a
small
insignificant
creature
compared
with
what
was
passing
now
between
himself
and
that
lofty
in
finite
sky
with
the
clouds
flying
over
it
.
at
that
moment
it
meant
nothing
to
him
who
might
be
standing
over
him
or
what
was
said
of
him
he
was
only
glad
that
people
were
standing
near
him
and
only
wished
that
they
would
help
him
and
bring
him
back
to
life
which
seemed
to
him
so
beautiful
now
that
he
had
today
learned
to
understand
it
so
differently
.
he
col
lected
all
his
strength
to
stir
and
utter
a
sound
.
he
feebly
moved
his
leg
and
uttered
a
weak
sickly
groan
which
aroused
his
own
pity
.
ah
he
is
alive
said
napoleon
.

this
young
man

up

to

to

victory
.
prince
andrew
remembered
nothing
more
he
lost
consciousness
from
the
terrible
pain
of
being
lifted
onto
the
stretcher
the
jolting
while
being
moved
and
the
probing
of
his
wound
at
the
dressing
station
.
he
did
not
re
gain
consciousness
till
late
in
the
day
when
with
other
wounded
and
captured
russian
of
ficers
he
was
carried
to
the
hospital
.
during
this
transfer
he
felt
a
little
stronger
and
was
able
to
look
about
him
and
even
speak
.
the
first
words
he
heard
on
coming
to
his
senses
were
those
of
a
french
convoy
officer
who
said
rapidly
we
must
halt
here
the
em
peror

pass
here
immediately
it
will
please
him
to

.
so
insignificant
at
that
moment
seemed
to
him
all
the
interests
that
engrossed
napoleon
so
mean
did
his
hero
himself
with
his
paltry
vanity
and
joy
in
victory
appear
compared
to
the
lofty
equitable
and
kindly
sky
which
he
had
seen
and
understood
that
he
could
not
answer
him
.
every
thing
seemed
so
futile
and
insignificant
in
comparison
with
the
stern
and
solemn
train
of
thought
that
weakness
from
loss
of
blood
suffering
and
the
nearness
of

aroused
in
him

looking
into
napoleons
eyes
prince
andrew
thought
of
the
insignificance
of

the
unimportance
of
life
which
no
one
could
understand
and
the
still
greater
unim

of

of

no

the

turned
home
on
leave
.
denisov
was
going
home
to
vor6nezh
and
rost6v
persuaded
him
to
travel
with
him
as
far
as
moscow
and
to
stay
with
him
there
.
meeting
a
comrade
at
the
last
post
station
but
one
before
moscow
denfsov
had
drunk
three
bottles
of
wine
with
him
and
despite
the
jolting
ruts
across
the
snow
covered
road
did
not
once
wake
up
on
the
way
to
moscow
but
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
sleigh
beside
rost6v
who
grew
more
and
more
im
patient
the
nearer
they
got
to
moscow
.
how
much
longer
how
much
longer
oh
these
insufferable
streets

thought
rost6v
when
their
leave
permits
had
been
passed
at
the
town
gate
and
they
had
entered
moscow
.
denfsov
were
here
hes

he
add
ed
leaning
forward
with
his
whole
body
as
if
in
that
position
he
hoped
to
hasten
the
speed
of
the
sleigh
.
denisov
gave
no
answer
.
theres
the
corner
at
the
crossroads
where
the
cabman
zakhar

his
stand
and

denfsov

and
made

to

the
box

to

.

was

rost6v
shouted
when
the
sleigh
was
only
three
houses
from
his
door
.
it
seemed
to
him
the
horses
were
not
moving
at
all
.
at
last
the
sleigh
bore
to
the
right
drew
up
at
an
entrance
and
rost6v
saw
overhead
the
old
familiar
cornice
with
a
bit
of
plaster
broken
off
the
porch
and
the
post
by
the
side
of
the
pavement
.
he
sprang
out
before
the
sleigh
stopped
and
ran
into
the
hall
.
the
house
stood
cold
and
silent
as
if
quite
regard
less
of
who
had
come
to
it
.
there
was
no
one
in
the
hall
.
oh
god
is
everyone
all
right
he
thought
stopping
for
a
moment
with
a
sink
ing
heart
and
then
immediately
starting
to
run
along
the
hall
and
up
the
warped
steps
of
the
familiar
staircase
.
the
wellknown
old
door

which
always
angered
the
countess
when
it
was
not
properly
cleaned
turned
as
loosely
as
ever

he
looked
up
at

his

of

suddenly
changed
to
one
of
delighted
amazement

probably
in

but
changing
his

came
back
and
stooped
to

threw
off
his

ran
on

through
the
large
dark
ballroom
.
all
was
the

there
were
the
same
old
card
tables
and
the
same
chandelier
with
a
cover
over
it
but
someone
had
already
seen
the
young
master
and
be

he
had
reached
the

some
thing
flew
out
from
a
side

like
a

and
began
hugging
and
kissing
him

another
and

another

sprang
from

door
and
a

he
could
not

every

shouted
talked
and
kissed
him
at

into

exclaiming
and

to

natdsha
after

by
the
skirt

away
and
pranced
up
and
down
in
one
place
like
a
goat
and
shrieked
piercingly
.
all
around
were
loving
eyes
glistening
with
tears
of
joy
and
all
around
were
lips
seeking
a
kiss
.
s6nya
too
all
rosy

clung
to
his
arm
and
radiant
with
bliss
looked
eagerly
toward
his
eyes
waiting
for
the
look
for
which
she
longed
.
s6nya
now
was
sixteen
and
she
was
very
pretty
especially
at
this
moment
of
happy
rapturous
excitement
.
she
gazed
at
him
not
taking
her
eyes
off
him
and
smiling
and
holding
her
breath
.
he
gave
her
a
grateful
look
but
was
still
expectant
and
looking
for
someone
.
the
old
countess
had
not
yet
come
.
but
now
steps
were
heard
at
the
door
steps
so
rapid
that
they
could
hardly
be
his
mothers
.
yet
it
was
she
dressed
in
a
new
gown
which
he
did
not
know
made
since
he
had
left
.
all
the
others
let
him
go
and
he
ran
to
her
.
when
they
met
she
fell
on
his
breast
sobbing
.
she
could
not
lift
her
face
but
only
pressed
it
to
nicholas

the
cold
braiding
of
his

natdsha
be

herself
with
rapture
springing
to
him
putting
her
arms
round
him
and
kissing
him
.
this
escapade
made
everybody
feel
confused
.
denfsov
blushed
too
but
smiled
and
taking
natdshas
hand
kissed
it
.
denfsov
was
shown
to
the
room
prepared
for
him
and
the
rostovs
all
gathered
round
nicholas
in
the
sitting
room
.
the
old
countess
not
letting
go
of
his
hand
and
kissing
it
every
moment
sat
beside
him
the
rest
crowding
round
him
watched
every
movement
word
or
look
of
his
never
taking
their
blissfully
adoring
eyes
off
him
.
his
broth
er
and
sisters
struggled
for
the
places
nearest
to
him
and
disputed
with
one
another
who
should
bring
him
his
tea
handkerchief
and
pipe
.
rost6v
was
very
happy
in
the
love
they
showed
him
but
the
first
moment
of
meeting
had
been
so
beatific
that
his
present
joy
seemed
insufficient
and
he
kept
expecting
something
more
more
and
yet
more
.
next
morning
after
the
fatigues
of
their
journey
the
travelers
slept
till
ten
oclock
.
in
the
room
next
their
bedroom
there
was
a
confusion
of
sabers
satchels
sabretaches
open
portmanteaus
and
dirty
boots
.
two
freshly
cleaned
pairs
with
spurs
had
just
been
placed
by
the
wall
.
the
servants
were
bringing
in
jugs
and
basins
hot
water
for
shaving
and
their
wellbrushed
clothes
.
there
was
a
mascu
line
odor
and
a
smell
of
tobacco
.

disheveled
head
from
the
hot
pillow

why

nearly
ten

answered

a
rustle
of
starched
petticoats
and
the
whispering
and
laughter
of

voices
came
from
the
adjoining
room
.
the

in

denfsov
hid
his
hairy
legs
under
the
blanket
looking
with
a
scared
face
at
his
comrade
for
help
.
the
door
having
let

closed
again
.
a
sound
of
laughter
came
from
behind
it
.

natashas

is
this
your

asked
petya
.
or
is
it
yours
he
said
addressing
the
blackmustached
denisov
with
servile
deference
.
rost6v
hurriedly
put
something
on
his
feet
drew
on
his
dressing
gown
and
went
out
.
na
tasha
had
put
on
one
spurred
boot
and
was
just
getting
her
foot
into

.the
other
.
s6nya
when
he
came
in
was
twirling
round
and
was
about
to
expand
her
dresses
into
a
balloon
and
sit
down
.
they
were
dressed
alike
in
new
pale
blue
frocks
and
were
both
fresh
rosy
and
bright
.
s6nya
ran
away
but
natdsha
taking
her
brothers
arm
led
him
into
the
sitting
room
where
they
began
talking
.
they
hardly
gave
one
another
time
to
ask
questions
and
give
replies
concerning
a
thousand
little
mat
ters
which
could
not
interest
anyone
but
them
selves
.
natasha
laughed
at
every
word
he
said
or
that
she
said
herself
not
because
what
they
were
saying
was
amusing
but
because
she
felt
happy
and
was
unable
to
control
her
joy
which
expressed
itself
by
laughter
.
oh
how
nice
how
splendid
she
said
to
everything
.
rost6v
felt
that
under
the
influence
of
the
warm
rays
of
love
that
childlike
smile
which
had
not
once
appeared
on
his
face
since
he
left
home
now
for
the
first
time
after
eighteen
months
again
brightened
his
soul
and
his
face
.
no
but
listen
she
said
now
you
are
quite
a
man
arent
you
im
awfully
glad
youre
my
brother
.
she
touched
his
mustache
.
i
want
to
know
what
you
men
are
like
.
are
you
the
same
as
we
no
why
did
s6nya
run
away
asked
rost6v
.
ah
yes
thats
a
whole
long
story
how
are
you
going
to
speak
to
her
thou
or
you
as
may
happen
said
rost6v
.
no
call
her
you
please
ill
tell
you
all
about
it
some
other
time
.
no
ill
tell
you
now
.
you
know
s6nyas
my
dearest
friend
.
such
a
friend
that
i
burned
my
arm
for
hersake
.look
here
she
pulled
up
her
muslin
sleeve
and
showed
him
a
red
scar
on
her
long
slender
delicate
arm
high
above
the
elbow
on
that
part
that
is
covered
even
by
a
ball
dress
.
i
burned
this
to
prove
my
love
for
her
.
i
just
heated
a
ruler
in
the
fire
and
pressed
it
there
sitting
on
the
sofa
with
the
little
cushions
on
its
arms
in
what
used
to
be
his
old
school
room
and
looking
into
natashas
wildly
bright
eyes
rostov
reentered
that
world
of
home
and
childhood
which
had
no
meaning
for
anyone
else
but
gave
him
some
of
the
best
joys
of
his
life
and
the
burning
of
an
arm
with
a
ruler
as
a
proof
of
love
did
not
seem
to
him
senseless
he
understood
and
was
not
surprised
at
it
.
well
and
is
that
all
he
asked
.
we
are
such
friends
such
friends
all
that
ruler
business
was
just
nonsense
but
we
are
friends
forever
.
she
if
she
loves
anyone
does
it
for
life
but
i
dont
understand
that
i
forget
quickly
.
well
what
then
well
she
loves
me
and
you
like
that
.
natiisha
suddenly
flushed
.
why
you
remember
before
you
went
away

.

.

.
well
she
says
you
are
to
forget
all
that
she
says
i
shall
love
him
always
but
let
him
be
free
.
isnt
that
lovely
and
noble
yes
very
noble
isnt
it
asked
natasha
so
seriously
and
excitedly
that
it
was
evident
that
what
she
was
now
saying
she
had
talked
of
before
with
tears
.
rost6v
became
thoughtful
.
i
never
go
back
on
my
word
he
said
.
be
sides
s6nya
is
so
charming
that
only
a
fool
would
renounce
such
happiness
.
no
no
cried
natasha
she
and
i
have
al
ready
talked
it
over
.
we
knew
youd
say
so
.
but
it
wont
do
because
you
see
if
you
say
that
if
you
consider
yourself
bound
by
your
promise
it
will
seem
as
if
she
had
not
meant
it
seriously
.
it
makes
it
as
if
you
were
marrying
her
because
you
must
and
that
wouldnt
do
at
all
.
rost6v
saw
that
it
had
been
well
considered
by
them
.
s6nya
had
already
struck
him
by
her
beauty
on
the
preceding
day
.
today
when
he
i68
war
and
peace
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
she
seemed
still
more
lovely
.
she
was
a
charming
girl
of
six
teen
evidently
passionately
in
love
with
him
he
did
not
doubt
that
for
an
instant
.
why
should
he
not
love
her
now
and
even
marry
her
rost6v
thought
but
just
now
there
were
so
many
other
pleasures
and
interests
before
him
yes
they
have
taken
a
wise
decision
he
thought
i
must
remain
free
.
well
then
thats
excellent
said
he
.
well
talk
it
over
later
on
.
oh
how
glad
i
am
to
have
you
well
and
are
you
still
true
to
boris
he
continued
.
oh
what
nonsense
cried
natdsha
laugh
ing
.
i
dont
think
about
him
or
anyone
else
and
i
dont
want
anything
of
the
kind
.
dear
me
i
then
what
are
you
up
to
now
now
repeated
natdsha
and
a
happy
smile
lit
up
her
face
.
have
you
seen
duport
no
.
not
seen
duport
the
famous
dancer
well
then
you
wont
understand
.
thats
what
im
up
to
.
curving
her
arms
natdsha
held
out
her
skirts
as
dancers
do
ran
back
a
few
steps
turned
cut
a
caper
brought
her
little
feet
sharply
together
and
made
some
steps
on
the
very
tips
of
her
toes
.
see
im
standing
see
she
said
but
could
not
maintain
herself
on
her
toes
any
longer
.
so
thats
what
im
up
tol
ill
never
marry
any
one
but
will
be
a
dancer
.
only
dont
tell
any
one
.
rost6v
laughed
so
loud
and
merrily
that
denisov
in
his
bedroom
felt
envious
and
na
tdsha
could
not
help
joining
in
.
no
but
dont
you
think
its
nice
she
kept
repeating
.
nice
and
so
you
no
longer
wish
to
marry
boris
natdsha
flared
up
.
i
dont
want
to
marry
anyone
.
and
ill
tell
him
so
when
i
see
him
dear
me
said
rost6v
.
but
thats
all
rubbish
natdsha
chattered
on
.
and
is
denfsov
nice
she
asked
.
yes
indeed
oh
well
then
goodby
go
and
dress
.
is
he
very
terrible
denisov
why
terrible
asked
nicholas
.
no
vdska
is
a
splendid
fellow
.
you
call
him
vdska
thats
funny
and
is
he
very
nice
very
.
well
then
be
quick
.
well
all
have
break
fast
together
.
and
natdsha
rose
and
went
out
of
the
room
on
tiptoe
like
a
ballet
dancer
but
smiling
as
only
happy
girls
of
fifteen
can
smile
.
when
rost6v
met
s6nya
in
the
drawing
room
he
red
dened
.
he
did
not
know
how
to
behave
with
her
.
the
evening
before
in
the
first
happy
mo
ment
of
meeting
they
had
kissed
each
other
but
today
they
felt
it
could
not
be
done
he
felt
that
everybody
including
his
mother
and
sis
ters
was
looking
inquiringly
at
him
and
watch
ing
to
see
how
he
would
behave
with
her
.
he
kissed
her
hand
and
addressed
her
not
as
thou
but
as
you
sdnya
.
but
their
eyes
met
and
said
thou
and
exchanged
tender
kisses
.
her
looks
asked
him
to
forgive
her
for
having
dared
by
natdshas
intermediacy
to
remind
him
of
his
promise
and
then
thanked
him
for
his
love
.
his
looks
thanked
her
for
offering
him
his
free
dom
and
told
her
that
one
way
or
another
he
would
never
cease
to
love
her
for
that
would
be
impossible
.
how
strange
it
is
said
wra
selecting
a
moment
when
all
were
silent
that
s6nya
and
nicholas
now
say
you
to
one
another
and
meet
like
strangers
.
vras
remark
was
correct
as
her
remarks
al
ways
were
but
like
most
of
her
observations
it
made
everyone
feel
uncomfortable
not
only
s6nya
nicholas

.and
natdsha
but
even
the
old
countess
who
dreading
this
love
affair
which
might
hinder
nicholas
from
making
a
brilliant
match
blushed
like
a
girl
.
denfsov
to
rost6vs
surprise
appeared
in
the
drawing
room
with
pomaded
hair
per
fumed
and
in
a
new
uniform
looking
just
as
smart
as
he
made
himself
when
going
into
bat
tle
and
he
was
more
amiable
to
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
than
rost6v
had
ever
expected
to
see
him
.
chapter
ii
on
his
return
to
moscow
from
the
army
nicholas
rost6v
was
welcomed
by
his
home
cir
cle
as
the
best
of
sons
a
hero
and
their
darling
nik61enka
by
his
relations
as
a
charming
at
tractive
and
polite
youngman
by
his
acquaint
ances
as
a
handsome
lieutenant
of
hussars
a
good
dancer
and
one
of
the
best
matches
in
the
city
.
the
rost6vs
knew
everybody
in
moscow
.
the
old
count
had
money
enough
that
year
as
all
his
estates
had
been
remortgaged
and
so
nicholas
acquiring
a
trotter
of
his
own
very
stylish
riding
breeches
of
the
latest
cut
such
as
no
one
else
yet
had
in
moscow
and
boots
of
the
latest
fashion
with
extremely
pointed
toes
book
four
169
and
small
silver
spurs
passed
his
time
very
gaily
.
after
a
short
period
of
adapting
himself
to
the
old
conditions
of
life
nicholas
found
it
very
pleasant
to
be
at
home
again
.
he
felt
that
he
had
grown
up
and
matured
very
much
.
his
despair
at
failing
in
a
scripture
examination
his
borrowing
money
from
gavrfl
to
pay
a
sleigh
driver
his
kissing
s6nya
on
the
sly
he
now
recalled
all
this
as
childishness
he
had
left
immeasurably
behind
.
now
he
was
a
lieuten
ant
of
hussars
in
a
jacket
laced
with
silver
and
wearing
the
cross
of
st
.
george
awarded
to
soldiers
for
bravery
in
action
and
in
the
com
pany
of
wellknown
elderly
and
respected
rac
ing
men
was
training
a
trotter
of
his
own
for
a
race
.
he
knew
a
lady
on
one
of
the
boulevards
whom
he
visited
of
an
evening
.
he
led
the
mazurka
at
the
arkhdrovs
ball
talked
about
the
war
with
field
marshal
kdmenski
visited
the
english
club
and
was
on
intimate
terms
with
a
colonel
of
forty
to
whom
denisov
had
introduced
him
.
his
passion
for
the
emperor
had
cooled
somewhat
in
moscow
.
but
still
as
he
did
not
see
him
and
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
him
he
often
spoke
about
him
and
about
his
love
for
him
letting
it
be
understood
that
he
had
not
told
all
and
that
there
was
something
in
his
feel
ings
for
the
emperor
not
everyone
could
understand
and
with
his
whole
soul
he
shared
the
adoration
then
common
in
moscow
for
the
emperor
who
was
spoken
of
as
the
angel
in
carnate
.
during
rost6vs
short
stay
in
moscow
before
rejoining
the
army
he
did
not
draw
closer
to
s6nya
but
rather
drifted
away
from
her
.
she
was
very
pretty
and
sweet
and
evidently
deep
ly
in
love
with
him
but
he
was
at
the
period
of
youth
when
there
seems
so
much
to
do
that
there
is
no
time
for
that
sort
of
thing
and
a
young
man
fears
to
bind
himself
and
prizes
his
freedom
which
he
needs
for
so
many
other
things
.
when
he
thought
of
s6nya
during
this
stay
in
moscow
he
said
to
himself
ah
there
will
be
and
there
are
many
more
such
girls
somewhere
whom
i
do
not
yet
know
.
there
will
be
time
enough
to
think
about
love
when
i
want
to
but
now
i
have
no
time
.
besides
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
society
of
women
was
rather
derogatory
to
his
manhood
.
he
went
to
balls
and
into
ladies
society
with
an
affectation
of
doing
so
against
his
will
.
the
races
the
english
club
sprees
with
denisov
and
visits
to
a
certain
housethat
was
another
matter
and
quite
the
thing
for
a
dashing
young
hussarl
at
the
beginning
of
march
old
count
rost6v
was
very
busy
arranging
a
dinner
in
honorof
prince
bagrati6n
at
the
english
club
.
the
count
walked
up
and
down
the
hall
in
his
dressing
gown
giving
orders
to
the
club
steward
and
to
the
famous
feoktfst
the
clubs
head
cook
about
asparagus
fresh
cucumbers
strawberries
veal
and
fish
for
this
dinner
.
the
count
had
been
a
member
and
on
the
commit
tee
of
the
club
from
the
day
it
was
founded
.
to
him
the
club
entrusted
theavrangement
of
the
festival
in
honor
of
bagrati6n
for
few
men
knew
so
well
how
to
arrange
a
feast
on
an
open
handed
hospitable
scale
and
still
fewer
men
would
be
so
well
able
and
willing
to
make
up
out
of
their
own
resources
what
might
be
need
ed
for
the
success
of
the
fete
.
the
club
cook
and
the
steward
listened
to
the
counts
orders
with
pleased
faces
for
they
knew
that
under
no
oth
er
management
could
they
so
easily
extract
a
good
profit
for
themselves
from
a
dinner
cost
ing
several
thousand
rubles
.
well
then
mind
and
have
cocks
combs
in
the
turtle
soup
you
know
shall
we
have
three
cold
dishes
then
asked
the
cook
.
the
count
considered
.
we
cant
have
lessyes
three

.

.

.
the
may
onnaise
thats
one
said
he
bending
down
a
finger
.
then
am
i
to
order
those
large
sterlets
asked
the
steward
.
yes
it
cant
be
helped
if
they
wont
take
less
.
ah
dear
me
i
was
forgetting
.
we
must
have
another
entree
.
ah
goodness
gracious
he
clutched
at
his
head
.
who
is
going
to
get
me
the
flowers
dmftri
eh
dmitri
1
gallop
off
to
our
moscow
estate
he
said
to
the
factotum
who
appeared
at
his
call
.
hurry
off
and
tell
maksim
the
gardener
to
set
the
serfs
to
work
.
say
that
everything
out
of
the
hothouses
must
be
brought
here
well
wrapped
up
in
felt
.
i
must
have
two
hundred
pots
here
on
friday
.
having
given
several
more
orders
he
was
about
to
go
to
his
little
countess
to
have
a
rest
but
remembering
something
else
of
im
portance
he
returned
again
called
back
the
cook
and
the
club
steward
and
again
began
giving
orders
.
a
light
footstep
and
the
clinking
of
spurs
were
heard
at
the
door
and
the
young
count
handsome
rosy
with
a
dark
little
mus
tache
evidently
rested
and
made
sleeker
by
his
easy
life
in
moscow
entered
the
room
.
ah
my
boy
my
heads
in
a
whirl
said
the
old
man
with
a
smile
as
if
he
felt
a
little
con
fused
before
his
son
now
if
you
would
only
170
war
and
peace
help
a
bit
i
must
have
singers
too
.
i
shall
have
my
own
orchestra
but
shouldnt
we
get
the
gypsy
singers
as
well
you
military
men
like
that
sort
of
thing
.
really
papa
i
believe
prince
bagrati6n
worried
himself
less
before
the
battle
of
schon
grabern
than
you
do
now
said
his
son
with
a
smile
.
the
old
count
pretended
to
be
angry
.
yes
you
talk
but
try
it
yourself
and
the
count
turned
to
the
cook
who
with
a
shrewd
and
respectful
expression
looked
ob
servantly
and
sympathetically
at
the
father
and
son
.
what
have
the
young
people
come
to
now
adays
eh
feoktist
said
he
.
laughing
at
us
old
fellows
thats
so
your
excellency
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
eat
a
good
dinner
but
providing
it
and
serving
it
all
up
thats
not
their
business
thats
it
thats
it
exclaimed
the
count
and
gaily
seizing
his
son
by
both
hands
he
cried
now
ive
got

so

the
sleigh
and
pair
at
once
and

and
tell
him

asked
nicholas
laughing
.
dear
dear

.

.

.
at
that
moment
with
noiseless
footsteps
and
with
the
businesslike
preoccupied
yet
meekly
christian
look
which
never
left
her
face
anna
mikmylovna
entered
the
hall
.
though
she
came
upon
thecount
in
his
dressing
gown
every
day
he
invariably
became
confused
and
begged
her
to
excuse
his
costume
.
no
matter
at
all
my
dear
count
she
said
meekly
closing
her
eyes
.
but
ill
go
to
bezuk
hovs
myself
.
pierre
has
arrived
and
now
we
shall
get
anything
we
want
from
his
hothouses
.

case
.
he
has
forward
ed
me
a
letter
from
boris
.
thank
god
boris
is
now
on
the
staff
.
the
count
was
delighted
at
anna
mikhay
lovnas
taking
upon
herself
one
of
his
com
missions
and
ordered
the
small
closed
carriage
for
her
.
tell
bezukhov
to
come
.
ill
put
his
name
down
.
is
bis
wife
with
him
he
asked
.
anna
mikhdylovna
turned
up
her
eyes
and
profound
sadness
was
depicted
on
her
face
.
ah
my
dear
friend
he
is
very
unfortunate
she
said
.
if
what
we
hear
is
true
it
is
dreadful
.
how
little
we
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
when
we
were
rejoicing
at
his
happiness
and
such
a
lofty
angelic
soul
as
young
bezukhovl
yes
i
pity
him
from
my
heart
and
shall
try
to
give
him
what
consolation
i
can
.
whwhat
is
the
matter
asked
both
the
young
and
old
rostov
.
anna
mikhdylovna
sighed
deeply
.
d61okhov
mary
ivdnovnas
son
she
said
in
a
mysterious
whisper
has
compromised
her
completely
they
say
.
pierre
took
him
up
in
vited
him
to
his
house
in
petersburg
and
now

..
.
she
has
come
here
and
that
daredevil
after
her
said
anna
mikhylovna
wishing
to
show
her
sympathy
for
pierre
but
by
involuntary
intonations
and
a
half
smile
betraying
her
sympathy
for
the
daredevil
as
she
called
ddlokhov
.
they
say
pierre
is
quite
broken
by
his
misfortune
.
dear
dear
but
still
tell
him
to
come
to
the
club
it
will
all
blow
over
.
it
will
be
a
tre
mendous
banquet
.
next
day
the
third
of
march
soon
after
one
oclock
two
hundred
and
fifty
members
of
the
english
cluband
fifty
guests
were
awaiting
the
guest
of
honor
and
hero
of
the
austrian
cam
paign
prince
bagrati6n
to
dinner
.
on
the
first
arrival
of
the
news
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
moscow
had
been
bewildered
.
at
that
time
the
russians
were
so
used
to
victories
that
on
receiving
news
of
the
defeat
some
would
simply
not
believe
it
while
others
sought
some
extraordinary
explanation
of
so
strange
an
event
.
in
the
english
club
where
all
who
were
distinguished
important
and
well
in
formed
forgathered
when
the
news
began
to
arrive
in
december
nothing
was
said
about
the
war
and
the
last
battle
as
though
all
were
in
a
conspiracy
of
silence
.
the
men
who
set
the
tone
in
conversation
count
rostopchin
prince
yuri
dolgortikov
valiiev
count
mdrkov
and
prince
vyazemski
did
not
show
themselves
at
the
club
but
met
in
private
houses
in
inti
mate
circles
and
the
moscovites
who
took
their
opinions
from
others
ilya
rost6v
among
them
remained
for
a
while
without
any
defi
nite
opinion
on
the
subject
of
the
war
and
without
leaders
.
the
moscovites
felt
that
some
thing
was
wrong
and
that
to
discuss
the
bad
news
was
difficult
and
so
it
was
best
to
be
si
lent
.
but
after
a
while
just
as
a
jury
comes
out
of
its
room
the
bigwigs
who
guided

opinion
reappeared
and
everybody
began
speaking
clearly
and
definitely
.
reasons
were
found
for
the
incredible
unheardof
and
im
possible
event
of
a
russian
defeat
everything
became
clear
and
in
all
corners
of
moscow
the
same
things
began
to
be
said
.
these
reasons
were
the
treachery
of
the
austrians
a
defective
commissariat
the
treachery
of
the
pole
przeby
szwski
and
of
the
frenchman
langeron
ku
tuzovs
incapacity
and
it
was
whispered
the
youth
and
inexperience
of
the
sovereign
who
had
trusted
worthless
and
insignificant
people
.
but
the
army
the
russian
army
everyone
de
clared
was
extraordinary
and
had
achieved
miracles
of
valor
.
the
soldiers
officers
and
gen
erals
were
heroes
.
but
the
hero
of
heroes
was
prince
bagrati6n
distinguished
by
his
schon
grabern
affair
and
by
the
retreat
from
auster
litz
where
he
alone
had
withdrawn
his
col
umn
unbroken
and
had
all
day
beaten
back
an
enemy
force
twice
as
numerous
as
his
own
.
what
also
conduced
to
bagrati6ns
being
se
lected
as
moscows
hero
was
the
fact
that
he
had
no
connections
in
the
city
and
was
a
stran
ger
there
.
in
his
person
honor
was
shown
to
a
simple
fighting
russian
soldier
without
con
nections
and
intrigues
and
to
one
who
was
as
sociated
by
memories
of
the
italian
campaign
with
the
name
of
suv6rov
.
moreover
paying
such
honor
to
bagrati6n
was
the
best
way
of
expressing
disapproval
and
dislike
of
kutiizov
.
had
there
been
no
bagrati6n
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
invent
him
said
the
wit
shinshfn
parodying
the
words
of
voltaire
.
kutiizov
no
one
spoke
of
except
some
who
abused
him
in
whispers
calling
him
a
court
weathercock
and
an
old
satyr
.
all
moscow
repeated
prince
dolgonikovs
saying
if
you
go
on
modeling
and
model
ing
you
must
get
smeared
with
clay
suggest
ing
consolation
for
our
defeat
by
the
memory
of
former
victories
and
the
words
of
rostop
chfn
that
french
soldiers
have
to
be
incited
to
battle
by
highfalutin
words
and
germans
by
logical
arguments
to
show
them
that
it
is
more
dangerous
to
run
away
than
to
advance
but
that
russian
soldiers
only
need
to
be
restrained
and
held
back
on
all
sides
new
and
fresh
an
ecdotes
were
heard
of
individual
examples
of
heroism
shown
by
our
officers
and
men
at
aus
terlitz
.
one
had
saved
a
standard
another
had
killed

berg
was
mentioned
by
those
who
did
not
know
him
as
having
when
wounded
in
the
right
hand
taken
his
sword
in
the
left
and
gone
forward
.
of
bolk6nski
noth
ing
was
said
and
only
those
who
knew
him
in
timately
regretted
that
he
had
died
so
young
leaving
a
pregnant
wife
with
his
eccentric
father
.
chapter
iii
on
that
third
of
march
all
the
rooms
in
the
english
club
were
filled
with
a
hum
of
conver
sation
like
the
hum
of
beesswarming
in
spring
time
.
the
members
and
guests
of
the
club
wandered
hither
and
thither
sat
stood
met
and
separated
some
in
uniform
and
some
in
evening
dress
and
a
few
here
and
there
with
powdered
hair
and
in
russian
kaftdns
.
pow
dered
footmen
in
livery
with
buckled
shoes
and
smart
stockings
stood
at
every
door
anx
iously
noting
visitors
every
movement
in
order
to
offer
their
services
.
most
of
those
present
were
elderly
respected
men
with
broad
self
confident
faces
fat
fingers
and
resolute
ges
tures
and
voices
.
this
class
of
guests
and
mem
bers
sat
in
certain
habitual
places
and
met
in
certain
habitual
groups
.
a
minority
of
those
present
were
casual
guests
chiefly
young
men
among
whom
were
denfsov
rostov
and
d6
lokhov
who
was
now
again
an
officer
in
the
semenov
regiment
.
the
faces
of
these
young
people
especially
those
who
were
militarymen
bore
that
expression
of
condescending
respect
for
their
elders
which
seems
to
say
to
the
older
generation
we
are
prepared
to
respect
and
honor
you
but
all
the
same
remember
that
the
future
belongs
to
us
.
nesvf
tski
was
there
as
an
old
member
of
the
club
.
pierre
who
at
his
wifes
command
had
let
his
hair
grow
and
abandoned
his
spectacles
went
about
the
rooms
fashionably
dressed
but
looking
sad
and
dull
.
here
as
elsewhere
he
was
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
subser
vience
to
his
wealth
and
being
in
the
habit
of
lording
it
over
these
people
he
treated
them
with
absentminded
contempt
.
by
his
age
he
should
have
belonged
to
the
younger
men
but
by
his
wealth
and
connec
tions
he
belonged
to
the
groups
of
old
and
hon
ored
guests
and
so
he
went
from
one
group
to
another
.
some
of
the
most
important
old
men
were
the
center
of
groups
which
even
strangers
approached
respectfully
to
hear
the
voices
of
wellknown
men
.
the
largest
circles
formed
round
count
rostopchfn
valtiev
and
nary
shkin
.
rostopchfn
was
describing
how
the
rus
sians
had
been
overwhelmed
by
flying
austri
ans
and
had
had
to
force
their
way
through
them
with
bayonets
.
valiiev
was
confidentially
telling
that
uvdrov
war
and
peace
had
been
sent
from
petersburg
to
ascertain
what
moscow
was
thinking
about
austerlitz
.
in
the
third
circle
naryshkin
was
speaking
of
the
meeting
of
the
austrian
council
of
war
at
which
suv6rov
crowed
like
a
cock
in
reply
to
the
nonsense
talked
by
the
austrian
generals
.
shinshfn
standing
close
by
tried
to
make
a
joke
saying
that
kutuzov
had
evidently
failed
to
learn
from
suv6roveven
so
simple
a
thing
as
the
art
of
crowing
like
a
cock
but
the
elder
members
glanced
severely
at
the
wit
making
him
feel
that
in
that
place
and
on
that
day
it
was
improper
to
speak
so
of
kutuzov
.
count
ilyd
rost6v
hurried
and
preoccupied
went
about
in
his
soft
boots
between
the
din
ing
and
drawing
rooms
hastily
greeting
the
important
and
unimportant
all
of
whom
he
knew
as
if
they
were
all
equals
while
his
eyes
occasionally
sought
out
his
fine
wellsetup
young
son
resting
on
him
and
winking
joyful
ly
at
him
.
young
rost6v
stood
at
a
window
with
dolokhov
whose
acquaintance
he
had
lately
made
and
highly
valued
.
the
old
count
came
up
to
them
and
pressed

hand

he
said
turning
to
an
old
man
who
was
passing
but
before
he
had
finished
his
greeting
there
was
a
general
stir
and
a
footman
who
had
run
in
announced
with
a
frightened
face

forward
and
like

who
had
been
scattered
about

ent
rooms
came
together
and
crowded
in
the
large
drawing
room
by
the
door
of
the
ball
room
.
bagrati6n
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
anteroom
without
hat
or
sword
which
in
ac
cord
with
the
club
custom
he
had
given
up
to
the
hall
porter
.
he
had
no
lambskin
cap
on
his
head
nor
had
he
a
loaded
whip
over
his
shoul
der
as
when
rost6v
had
seen
him
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
but
wore
a
tight
new
uniform
with
russian
and
foreign
orders
and
the
star
of
st
.
george
on
his
left
breast
.
evi
dently
just
before
coming
to
the
dinner
he
had
had
his
hair
and
whiskers
trimmed
which
changed
his
appearance
for
the
worse
.
there
was
something
naively
festive
in
his
air
which
in
con
junction
with
his
firm
and
virile
features
gave
him
a
rather
comical
expression
.
bekle
shev
and
theodore
uvdrov
who
had
arrived
with
him
paused
at
the
doorway
to
allow
him
as
the
guest
of
honor
to
enter
first
.
bagrati6n
was
embarrassed
not
wishing
to
avail
himself
of
their
courtesy
and
this
caused
some
delay
at
the
doors
but
after
all
he
did
at
last
enter
first
.
he
walked
shyly
and
awkwardly
over
the
parquet
floor
of
the
reception
room
not
know
ing
what
to
do
with
his
hands
he
was
more
ac
customed
to
walk
over
a
plowed
field
under
fire
as
he
had
done
at
the
head
of
the
kursk
regiment
at
schon
grabern
and
he
would
have
found
that
easier
.
the
committeemen
met
him
at
the
first
door
and
expressing
their
de
light
at
seeing
such
a
highly
honored
guest
took
possession
of
him
as

him
and
led
him
to
the

.
it
was
at
first
impos

to
enter
the

for
the
crowd
of
members
and
guests
jostling
one
an

and

a

but
all

demanded
that

feeling
himself
in

he

the

with

and
looked
sternly

reproachfully
at
the

to

and

rose
feeling
that

was
more
important
than

and
bagrati6n
again
preceding
all
the
rest
went
in
to
dinner
.
he
was
seated
in
the
place
of
honor
between
two
alexanders

and

which
was
a
significant
allusion
to

at

and
taking
up

and
emptying
his

at

he
dashed

to

followed
his

continued
for

when

subsided
the

cleared
away
the

and

sat
down
again
smiling
at

chapter
iv
pierre
sat
opposite
d61okhov
and
nicholas
rost6v
.
as
usual
he
ate
and
drank
much
and
eagerly
.
but
those
who
knew
him
intimately
noticed
that
some
great
change
had
come
over
him
that
day
.
he
was
silent
all
through
dinner
and
looked
about
blinking
and
scowling
or
with
fixed
eyes
and
a
look
of
complete
absent
mindedness
kept
rubbing
the
bridge
of
his
nose
.
his
face
was
depressed
and
gloomy
.
he
seemed
to
see
and
hear
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
and
to
be
absorbed
by
some
depressing
and
unsolved
problem
.
the
unsolved
problem
that
tormented
him
was
caused
by
hints
given
by
the
princess
his
cousin
at
moscow
concerning
d61okhovs
war
and
peace
intimacy
with
his
wife
and
by
an
anonymous
letter
he
had
received
that
morning
which
in
the
mean
jocular
way
common
to
anonymous
letters
said
that
he
saw
badly
through
his
spec
tacles
but
that
his
wifes
connection
with
d61
okhov
was
a
secret
to
no
one
but
himself
.
pierre
absolutely
disbelieved
both
the
princess
hints
and
the
letter
but
he
feared
now
to
look
at
d61okhov
who
was
sitting
opposite
him
.
every
time
he
chanced
to
meet
drilokhovs
handsome
insolent
eyes
pierre
felt
something
terrible
and
monstrous
rising
in
his
soul
and
turned
quickly
away
.
involuntarily
recalling
his
wifes
past
and
her
relations
with
d61okhov
pierre
saw
clearly
that
what
was
said
in
the
let
ter
might
be
true
or
might
at
least
seem
to
be
true
had
it
not
referred
to
his
wife
.
he
invol
untarily
remembered
how
d61okhov
who
had
fully
recovered
his
former
position
after
the
campaign
had
returned
to
petersburg
and
come
to
him
.
availing
himself
of
his
friendly
relations
with
pierre
as
a
boon
companion
d6iokhov
had
come
straight
to
his
house
and
pierre
had
put
him
up
and
lent
him
money
.
pi
erre
recalled
how
hlne
had
smilingly
ex
pressed
disapproval
of
d61okhovs
living
at
their
house
and
how
cynically
dolokhov
had
praised
his
wifes
beauty
to
him
and
from
that
time
till
they
came
to
moscow
had
not
left
them
for
a
day
.
yes
he
is
very
handsome
thought
pierre
and
i
know
him
.
it
would
be
particularly
pleasant
to
him
to
dishonor
my
name
and
rid
icule
me
just
because
i
have
exerted
myself
on
his
behalf
befriended
him
and
helped
him
.
i
know
and
understand
what
a
spice
that
would
add
to
the
pleasure
of
deceiving
me
if
it
real
ly
were
true
.
yes
if
it
were
true
but
i
do
not
believe
it
.
i
have
no
right
to
and
cant
believe
it
.
he
remembered
the
expression
dolokhovs
face
assumed
in
his
moments
of
cruelty
as
when
tying
the
policeman
to
the
bear
and
dropping
them
into
the
water
or
when
he
chal
lenged
a
man
to
a
duel
without
any
reason
or
shot
a
postboys
horse
with
a
pistol
.
that
ex
pression
was
often
on
d61okhovs
face
when
looking
at
him
.
yes
he
is
a
bully
thought
pierre
to
kill
a
man
means
nothing
to
him
.
it
must
seem
to
him
that
everyone
is
afraid
of
him
and
that
must
please
him
.
he
must
think
that
i
too
am
afraid
of
him
and
in
fact
i
am
afraid
of
him
he
thought
and
again
he
felt
something
terrible
and
monstrous
rising
in
his
soul
.
d61okhov
denisov
and
rost6vwere
now
sitting
opposite
pierre
and
seemed
very
gay
.
rost6v
was
talking
merrily
to
his
two
friends
one
of
whom
was
a
dashing
hussar
and
the
oth
er
a
notorious
duelist
and
rake
and
every
now
and
then
he
glanced
ironically
at
pierre
whose
preoccupied
absentminded
and
massive
fig
ure
was
a
very
noticeable
one
at
the
dinner
.
rost6v
looked
inimically
at
pierre
first
be
cause
pierre
appeared
to
his
hussar
eyes
as
a
rich
civilian
the
husband
of
a
beauty
and
in
a
word
an
old
woman
and
secondly
because
pierre
in
his
preoccupation
and
absentmind
edness
had
not
recognized
rostov
and
had
not
responded
to
his
greeting
.
when
the
emperors
health
was
drunk
pierre
lost
in
thought
did
not
rise
or
lift
his
glass
.
what
are
you
about
shouted
rost6v
look
ing
at
him
in
an
ecstacyof
exasperation
.
dont
you
hear
its
his
majesty
the
emperors
health
pierre
sighed
rose
submissively
emptied
his
glass
and
waiting
till
all
were
seated
again
turned
with
his
kindly
smile
to
rostov
.
why
i
didnt
recognize
you
he
said
.
but
rost6v
was
otherwise
engaged
he
was
shout
ing
hurrah
why
dont
you
renew
the
acquaintance
said
d61okhov
to
rost6v
.
confound
him
hes
a
fool
said
rost6v
.
one
should
make
up
to
the
husbands
of
pretty
women
said
denisov
.
pierre
did
not
catch
what
they
were
saying
but
knew
they
were
talking
about
him
.
he
red
dened
and
turned
away
.
well
now
to
the
health
of
handsome
wom
en
said
d61okhov
and
with
a
serious
expres
sion
but
with
a
smile
lurking
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
turned
with
his
glass
to
pierre
.
heres
to
the
health
of
lovely
women
pe
tcrkin
and
their
lovers
he
added
.
pierre
with
downcast
eyes
drank
out
of
his
glass
without
looking
at
d61okhov
or
answer
ing
him
.
the
footman
who
was
distributing
leaflets
with
kutuzovs
cantata
laid
one
before
pierre
as
one
of
the
principal
guests
.
he
was
just
going
to
take
it
when
d61okhov
leaning
across
snatched
it
from
his
hand
and
began
reading
it
.
pierre
looked
at
d61okhov
and
his
eyes
dropped
the
something
terrible
and
mon
strous
that
had
tormented
him
all
dinnertime
rose
and
took
possession
of
him
.
he
leaned
his
whole
massive
body
across
the
table
.
how
dare
you
take
it
he
shouted
.
hearing
that
cry
and
seeing
to
whom
it
was
addressed
nesvitski
and
the
neighbor
on
his
right
quickly
turned
in
alarm
to
bezukhov
.
dont
dont
what
are
you
about
whis
pered
their
frightened
voices
.
d61okhov
looked
at
pierre
with
clear
mirth
book
four
ful
cruel
eyes
and
that
smile
of
his
which
seemed
to
say
ah
this
is
what
i
like
you
shant
have
it
he
said
distinctly
.
pale
with
quivering
lips
pierre
snatched
the
copy
.
you

.

.

.

you

.

.

.
scoundrel
i
challenge
you
he
ejaculated
and
pushing
back
his
chair
he
rose
from
the
table
.
at
the
very
instant
he
did
this
and
uttered
those
words
pierre
felt
that
the
question
of
his
wifes
guilt
which
had
been
tormenting
him
the
whole
day
was
finally
and
indubitably
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
he
hated
her
and
was
for
ever
sundered
from
her
.
despite
denisovs
re
quest
that
he
would
take
no
part
in
the
matter
rost6v
agreed
to
be
dolokhovs
second
and
after
dinner
he
discussed
the
arrangements
for
the
duel
with
nesvitski
beziikhovs
second
.
pierre
went
home
but
rost6v
with
dolokhov
and
denfsov
stayed
on
at
the
club
till
late
listening
to
the
gypsies
and
other
singers
.
well
then
till
tomorrow
at
sok61nikisaid
d61okhov
as
he
took
leave
of
rostov
in
the
club
porch
.
and
do
you
feel
quite
calm
rost6v
asked
.
d61okhov
paused
.
well
you
see
ill
tell
you
the
whole
secret
of
dueling
in
two
words
.
if
you
are
going
to
fight
a
duel
and
you
make
a
will
and
write
af
fectionate
letters
to
your
parents
and
if
you
think
you
may
be
killed
you
are
a
fool
and
are
lost
for
certain
.
but
go
with
the
firm
intention
of
killing
your
man
as
quickly
and
surely
as
possible
and
then
all
will
be
right
as
our
bear
huntsman
at
kostromd
used
to
tell
me
.
every
one
fears
a
bear
he
says
but
when
you
see
one
your
fears
all
gone
and
your
only
thought
is
not
to
lethim
get
away
and
thats
how
it
is
with
me
.
a
demain
mon
cher

next
day
at
eight
in
the
morning
pierre
and
nesvftski
drove
to
the
sok61niki
forest
and
found
d61okhov
denfsov
and
rost6v
already
there
.
pierre
had
the
air
of
a
man
preoccupied
with
considerations
which
had
no
connection
with
the
matter
in
hand
.
his
haggard
face
was
yellow
.
he
had
evidently
not
slept
that
night
.
he
looked
about
distractedly
and
screwed
up
his
eyes
as
if
dazzled
by
the
sun
.
he
was
entirely
absorbed
by
two
considerations
his
wifes
guilt
of
which
after
his
sleepless
night
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
and
the
guiltlessness
of
d61okhov
who
had
no
reason
to
preserve
the
honor
of
a
man
who
was
nothing
to
him
i
should
perhaps
have
done
the
same
thing
in
his
place
thought
pierre
.
its
even
certain
that
1
till
tomorrow
my
dear
fellow
.
i
should
have
done
the
same
then
why
this
duel
this
murder
either
i
shall
kill
him
or
he
will
hit
me
in
the
head
or
elbow
or
knee
.
cant
i
go
away
from
here
run
away
bury
myself
somewhere
passed
through
his
mind
.
but
just
at
moments
when
such
thoughts
occurred
to
him
he
would
ask
in
a
particularly
calm
and
absentminded
way
which
inspired
the
respect
of
the
onlookers
will
it
be
long
are
things
ready
when
all
was
ready
the
sabers
stuck
in
the
snow
to
mark
the
barriers
and
the
pistols
load
ed
nesvitski
went
up
to
pierre
.
i
should
not
be
doing
my
duty
count
he
said
in
timid
tones
and
should
not
justify
your
confidence
and
the
honor
you
have
done
me
in
choosing
me
for
your
second
if
at
this
grave
this
very
grave
moment
i
did
not
tell
you
the
whole
truth
.
i
think
there
is
no
suffi
cient
ground
for
this
affair
or
for
blood
to
be
shed
over
it
.

..
.
you
were
not
right
not
quite
in
the
right
you
were
impetuous

.

.

.
oh
yes
it
is
horribly
stupid
said
pierre
.
then
allow
me
to
express
your
regrets
and
i
am
sure
your
opponent
will
accept
them
said
nesvftski
who
like
the
others
concerned
in
the
affair
and
like
everyone
in
similar
cases
did
not
yet
believe
that
the
affair
had
come
to
an
actual
duel
.
you
know
count
it
is
much
more
honorable
to
admit
ones
mistake
than
to
let
matters
become
irreparable
.
there
was
no
insult
on
either
side
.
allow
me
to
convey

.

.

.
no
what
is
there
to
talk
about
said
pi
erre
.
itsall
the
same
is
every
thing
ready
he
added
.
only
tell
me
where
to
go
and
where
to
shoot
he
said
with
an
unnaturally
gentle
smile
.
he
took
the
pistol
in
his
hand
and
began
ask
ing
about
the
working
of
the
trigger
as
he
had
not
before
held
a
pistol
in
his
hand
a
fact
that
he
did
not
wish
to
confess
.
oh
yes
like
that
i
know
i
only
forgot
said
he
.
no
apologies
none
whatever
said
d61o
khov
to
denfsov
who
on
his
side
had
been
at
tempting
a
reconciliation
and
he
also
went
up
to
the
appointed
place
.
the
spot
chosen
for
the
duel
was
some
eighty
paces
from
the
road
where
the
sleighs
had
been
left
in
a
small
clearing
in
the
pine
forest
covered
with
melting
snow
the
frost
having
begun
to
break
up
during
the
last
few
days
.
the
antagonists
stood
forty
paces
apart
at
the
farther
edge
of
the
clearing
.
the
seconds
meas
uring
the
paces
left
tracks
in
the
deep
wet
snow
between
the
place
where
they
had
been
176
war
and
peace
standingand
nesvftskisand
d61okhovs
sabers
which
were
stuck
into
the
ground
ten
paces
apart
to
mark
the
barrier
.
it
was
thawing
and
misty
at
forty
paces
distance
nothing
could
be
seen
.
for
three
minutes
all
had
been
ready
but
they
still
delayed
and
all
were
silent
.
chapter
v
well
begin
said
d61okhov
.
all
right
said
pierre
still
smiling
in
the
same
way
.
a
feeling
of
dread
was
in
the
air
.
it
was
evident
that
the
affair
so
lightly
begun
could
no
longer
be
averted
but
was
taking
its
course
independently
of
mens
will
.
denisov
first
went
to
the
barrier
and
an
nounced
as
the
advesawies
have
wefused
a
weconciliation
please
pwoceed
.take
your
pis
tols
and
at
the
word
thwee
begin
to
advance
.
one
twol
thwee
he
shouted
angrily
and
stepped
aside
.
the
combatants
advanced
along
the
trodden
tracks
nearer
and
nearer
to
one
another
be
ginning
to
see
one
another
through
the
mist
.
they
had
the
right
to
fire
when
they
liked
as
they
approached
the
barrier
.
d61okhov
walked
slowly
without
raising
his
pistol
looking
in
tently
with
his
bright
sparkling
blue
eyes
into
his
antagonists
face
.
his
mouth
wore
its
usual
semblance
of
a
smile
.
so
i
can
fire
when
i
like
said
pierre
and
at
the
word
three
he
went
quickly
forward
missing
the
trodden
path
and
stepping
into
the
deep
snow
.
he
held
the
pistol
in
his
right
hand
at
arms
length
apparently
afraid
of
shooting
himself
with
it
.
his
left
hand
he
held
careful
ly
back
because
he
wished
to
support
his
right
hand
with
it
and
knew
he
must
not
do
so
.
hav
ing
advanced
six
paces
and
strayed
off
the
track
into
the
snow
pierre
looked
down
at
his
feet
then
quickly
glanced
at
d61okhov
and
bend
ing
his
finger
as
he
had
been
shown
fired
.
not
at
all
expecting
so
loud
a
report
pierre
shud
dered
at
the
sound
and
then
smiling
at
his
own
sensations
stood
still
.
the
smoke
rendered
denser
by
the
mist
prevented
him
from
seeing
anything
for
an
instant
but
there
was
no
second
report
as
he
had
expected
.
he
only
heard
d6
lokhovs
hurried
steps
and
his
figure
came
in
view
through
the
smoke
.
he
was
pressing
one
hand
to
his
left
side
while
the
other
clutched
his
drooping
pistol
.
his
face
was
pale
.
rost6v
ran
toward
him
and
said
something
.
nooo
muttered
d61okhov
through
his
teeth
no
its
not
over
.
and
after
stumbling
a
few
staggering
steps
right
up
to
the
saber
he
sank
on
the
snow
beside
it
.
his
left
hand
was
bloody
he
wiped
it
on
his
coat
and
supported
himself
with
it
.
his
frowning
face
was
pallid
and
quivered
.
plea

..
.
began
d61okhov
but
could
not
at
first
pronounce
the
word
.
please
he
uttered
with
an
effort
.
pierre
hardly
restraining
his
sobs
began
running
toward
d61okhov
and
was
about
to
cross
the
space
between
the
barriers
when
d6
lokhov
cried
to
your
barrier
and
pierre
grasping
what
was
meant
stopped
by
his
saber
.
only
ten
paces
divided
them
.
d61okhov
lowered
his
head
to
the
snow
greedily
bit
at
it
again
raised
his
head
adjusted
himself
drew
in
his
legs
and
sat
up
seeking
a
firm
center
of
gravity
.
he
sucked
and
swallowed
the

chapter
vi
pierre
had
of
late
rarely
seen
his
wife
alone
.
both
in
petersburg
and
in
moscow
their
house
was
always
full
of
visitors
.
the
night
after
the
duel
he
did
not
go
to
his
bedroom
but
as
he
often
did
remained
in
his
fathers
room
that
huge
room
in
which
count
bezukhovhad
died
.
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
meaning
to
fall
asleep
and
forget
all
that
had
happened
to
him
but
could
not
do
so
.
such
a
storm
of
feelings
thoughts
and
memories
suddenly
arose
within
him
that
he
could
not
fall
asleep
nor
even
re
main
in
one
place
but
had
to
jump
up
and
pace
the
room
with
rapid
steps
.
now
he
seemed
to
see
her
in
the
early
days
of
their
marriage
with
bare
shoulders
and
a
languid
passionate
look
on
her
face
and
then
immediately
he
saw
beside
her
d61okhovs
handsome
insolent
hard
and
mocking
face
as
he
had
seen
it
at
the
banquet
and
then
that
same
face
pale
quiver
ing
and
suffering
as
it
had
been
when
he
reeled
and
sank
on
the
snow
.
what
has
happened
he
asked
himself
.
i
have
killed
her
lover
yes
killed
my
wifes
lover
.
yes
that
was
it
and
why
how
did
i
come
to
do
it
because
you
married
her
answered
an
inner
voice
.
but
in
what
was
i
to
blame
he
asked
.
in
marrying
her
without
loving
her
in
deceiving
yourself
and
her
.
and
he
vividly
recalled
that
moment
after
supper
at
prince
vasilis
when
he
spoke
those
words
he
had
found
so
difficult
to
utter
i
love
you
.
it
all
comes
from
that
even
then
i
felt
it
he
thought
.
i
felt
then
that
it
was
not
so
that
i
had
no
right
to
do
it
.
and
so
it
turns
out
.
he
remembered
his
honeymoon
and
blushed
at
the
recollection
.
particularly
vivid
humili
ating
and
shameful
was
the
recollection
of
how
one
day
soon
after
his
marriage
he
came
out
of
the
bedroom
into
his
study
a
little
be
fore
noon
in
his
silk
dressing
gown
and
found
his
head
steward
there
who
bowing
respect
fully
looked
into
his
face
and
at
his
dressing
gown
and
smiled
slightly
as
if
expressing
re
spectful
understanding
of
his
employers
hap
piness
.
but
how
often
i
have
felt
proud
of
her
proud
of
her
majestic
beauty
and
social
tact
thought
he
been
proud
of
my
house
in
which
she
received
all
petersburg
proud
of
her
unapproachability
and
beauty
.
so
this
is
what
i
was
proud
of
i
then
thought
that
i
did
not
understand
her
.
how
often
when
consider
ing
her
character
i
have
told
myself
that
i
was
to
blame
for
not
understanding
her
for
not
understanding
that
constant
composure
and
complacency
and
lack
of
all
interests
or
desires
and
the
whole
secret
lies
in
the
terrible
truth
that
she
is
a
depraved
woman
.
now
i
have
spoken
that
terrible
word
to
myself
all
has
be
come
clear
.
anatole
used
to
come
to
borrow
money
from
her
and
used
to
kiss
her
naked
shoulders
.
she
did
not
give
him
the
money
but
let
her
self
be
kissed
.
her
father
in
jest
tried
to
rouse
her
jealousy
and
she
replied
with
a
calm
smile
that
she
was
not
so
stupid
as
to
be
jealous
let
him
do
what
he
pleases
she
used
to
say
of
me
.
one
day
i
asked
her
if
she
felt
any
symptoms
of
pregnancy
.
she
laughed
contemptuously
and
said
she
was
not
a
fool
to
want
to
have
chil
dren
and
that
she
was
not
going
to
have
any
children
by
me
.
then
he
recalled
the
coarseness
and
blunt
ness
of
her
thoughts
and
the
vulgarity
of
the
expressions
that
were
natural
to
her
though
she
had
been
brought
up
in
the
most
aristo
cratic
circles
.
im
not
such
a
fool
.

used

often
seeing
the
success
she
had
with
young
and
old
men
and
women
pierre
could
not
un
derstand
why
he
did
not
love
her
.
yes
i
never
loved
her
said
he
to
himself
i
knew
she
was
a
depraved
woman
he
re
peated
but
dared
not
admit
it
to
myself
.
and
now
theres
d61okhov
sitting
in
the
snow
with
a
forced
smile
and
perhaps
dying
while
meet
ing
my
remorse
with
some
forced
bravado
pierre
was
one
of
those
people
who
in
spite
of
an
appearance
of
what
is
called

acter
do
not
seek
a
confidant
in
their
troubles
.
he
digested
his
sufferings
alone
.

and
is
it
worth
tormenting
oneself
when
one
has
only
a
moment
of
life
in
comparison
with
eternity
but
at
the
moment
when
he
imagined
him
self
calmed
by
such
reflections
she
suddenly
came
into
his
mind
as
she
was
at
the
moments
when
he
had
most
strongly
expressed
his
in
sincere
love
for
her
and
he
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
heart
and
had
again
to
get
up
and
move
about
and
break
and
tear
whatever
came
to
his
hand
.
why
did
i
tell
her
that
je
vous

kept
repeating
to
himself
.

he
had

it
for
the

time

occurred
to
him
and
he
began
to
laugh
at
himself
.
in
the
night
he
called
his
valet
and
told
him
to
pack
up
to
go
to
petersburg
.
he
could
not
imagine
how
he
could
speak
to
her
now
.
he
resolved
to
go
away
next
day
and
leave
a
letter
informing
her
of
his
intention
to
part
from
her
forever
.
next
morning
when
the
valet
came
into
the
room
with
his
coffee
pierre
was
lying
asleep
on
the
ottoman
with
an
open
book
in
his
hand
.
he
woke
up
and
looked
round
for
a
while
with
a
startled
expression
unable
to
realize
where
he
was
.
the
countess
told
me
to
inquire
whether
your
excellency
was
at
home
said
the
valet
.
but
before
pierre
could
decide
what
answer
he
would
send
the
countess
herself
in
a
white
satin
dressing

embroidered
with
silver
and
with
simply

hair
two
immense
plaits
twice
round

what

what

.
with
her
im
perturbable
calm
she
did
not
begin
to
speak
in
front
of
the
valet
.
she
knew
of
the
duel
and
had
come
to
speak
about
it
.
she
waited
till
the
valet
had
set
down
the
coffee
things
and
left
the
room
.
pierre
looked
at
her
timidly
over
his
spectacles
and
like
a
hare
surrounded
by
hounds
who
lays
back
her
ears
and
continues
to
crouch
motionless
before
her
enemies
he
tried
to
continue
reading
.
but
feeling
this
to
be
senseless
and
impossible
he
again
glanced
timidly
at
her
.
she
did
not
sit
down
but
looked
at
him
with
a
contemptuous
smile
waiting
for
the
valet
to
go
.
well
whats
this
now
what
have
you

up

eh
come

what
was
this

about

meant
to

pierre
turned
over
heavily
on
the

and
opened
his
mouth
but
could
not
reply
.
if

lay

he
was
suffering
physically
at
that

there
was
a

on

he
could

he

that

was

gave

to

all
his
estates
in

which
formed
the
larger
part

and
left

chapter

two
months
had
elapsed
since
the
news
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
and
the
loss
of
prince
andrew
had
reached
bald
hills
and
in
spite
of
the
letters
sent
through
the
embassy
and
all
the
searches
made
his
body
had
not
been
found
nor
was
he
on
the
list
of
prisoners
.
what
was
worst
of
all
for
his
relations
was
the
fact
that
there
was
still
a
possibility
of
his
having
been
picked
up
on
the
battlefield
by
the
peo
ple
of
the
place
and
that
he
might
now
be
ly
ing
recovering
or
dying
alone
among
stran
gers
and
unable
to
send
news
of
himself
.
the
gazettes
from
which
the
old
prince
first
heard
of
the
defeat
at
austerlitz
stated
as
usual
very
briefly
and
vaguely
that
after
brilliant
engage
ments
the
russians
had
had
to
retreat
and
had
made
their
withdrawal
in
perfect
order
.
the
old
prince
understood
from
this
official
report
that
our
army
had
been
defeated
.
a
week
after
the
gazette
report
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
came
a
letter
from
kutiizov
informing
the
prince
of
the
fate
that
had
befallen
his
son
.

kutiizov
fell
before
my
eyes
a
standard
in
his

and
at
the
head
of

he
fell
as
a

worthy
of

to
the
great
regret
of

and
of

it
is

the

on
the
field
of
battle
a
list
of
whom
has
been
sent
me
under
flag
of
truce
.
after
receiving
this
news
late
in
the
evening
when
he
was
alone
in
his
study
the
old
prince
went
for
his
walk
as
usual
next
morning
but
he
was
silent
with
his
steward
the
gardener
and
the
architect
and
though
he
looked
very
grim
he
said
nothing
to
anyone
.
when
princess
mary
went
to
him
at
the
us
ual
hour
he
was
working
at
his
lathe
and
as
usual
did
not
look
round
at
her
.
ah
princess
mary
he
said
suddenly
in
an
unnatural
voice
throwing
down
his
chisel
.
the
wheel
continued
to
revolve
by
its
own
impetus
and
princess
mary
long
remembered
the
dying
creak
of
that
wheel
which
merged
in
her
memory
with
what
followed
.
she
approached
him
saw
his
face
and
some
thing
gave
way
within
her
.
her
eyes
grew
dim
.
by
the
expression
of
her
fathers
face
not
sad
not
crushed
but
angry
and
working
unnatural
ly
she
saw
that
hanging
over
her
and
about
to
crush
her
was
some
terrible
misfortune
the
worst
in
life
one
she
had
not
yet
experienced
irreparable
and
incomprehensible
the
death
of
one
she
loved
.
father
andrew
said
the
ungraceful
awkward
princess
with
such
an
indescribable
charm
of
sorrow
and
selfforgetfulness
that
her
father
could
not
bear
her
look
but
turned
away
with
a
sob

princess

not

she
was
already
pale
but
on
hearing
these
words
her
face
changed
and
something
brightened
in
her
beautiful
radiant
eyes
.
it
was
as
if
joy
a
supreme
joy
apart
from
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
this
world
overflowed
the
great
grief
within
her
.
she
forgot
all
fear
of
her
father
went
up
to
him
took
his
hand
and
drawing
him
down
put
her
arm
round
his

the
princess
sank
helplessly
into
an
arm
chair
beside
her
father
and
wept
.
she
saw
her
brother
now
as
he
had
been
at
the
moment
when
he
took
leave
of
her
and
of
lise
his
look
tender
yet
proud
.
she
saw
him
tender
and
amused
as
he
was
when

put
on

when
princess
mary
returned
from
her
fa
ther
the
little
princess
sat
working
and
looked
up
with
that
curious
expression
of
inner
hap
py
calm
peculiar
to
pregnant
women
.
it
was
evident
that
her
eyes
did
not
see
princess
mary
but
were
looking
within

.

.

.
into
herself

..
.
at
something
joyful
and
mysterious
taking
place
within
her
.
mary
she
said
moving
away
from
the
embroidery
frame
and
lying
back
give
me
your
hand
.
she
took
her
sisterinlaws
hand
and
held
it
below
her
waist
.
her
eyes
were
smilingexpectantly
her
downy
lip
rose
and
remained
lifted
in
childlike
hap
piness
.
princess
mary
knelt
down
before
her
and
hid
her
face
in
the
folds
of
her
sisterinlaws
dress
.
there
there
do
you
feel
it
i
feel
so
strange

and
do

she
said
wiping

on

.
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
morning
princess
mary
began
trying
to
prepare
her

and
every
time
began
to
cry

was
the

she
said
nothing
but
looked
about
uneasily
as

in
search
of
something
.
be
fore
dinner
the
old
prince
of
whom
she
was
always
afraid
came
into
her
room
with
a
pe
culiarly
restless
and
malign
expression
and
went
out
again
without
saying
a
word
.
she
looked
at
princess
mary
then
sat
thinking
for
a
while
with
that
expression
of
attention
to
something
within
her
that
is
only
seen
in
preg
nant
women
and
suddenly
began
to
cry
.
has
anything
come
from
andrew
she
asked
.
no
you
know
its
too
soon
for
news
.
but
my
father
is
anxious
and
i
feel
afraid

so
theres
nothing
nothing
answered
princess
mary
look
ing
firmly
with
her
radiant
eyes
at
her
sisterin

.
she
had
determined
not
to
tell
her
and
per
suaded
her
father
to
hide
the
terrible
news
from
her
till
after
her
confinement
which
was
expected
within
a
few
days
.
princess
mary
and
the
old
prince
each
bore
and
hid
their
grief
in
their
own
way
.
the
old
prince
would
not
cher
ish
any
hope
he
made
up
his
mind
that
prince
andrew
had
been
killed
and
though
he
sent
an
official
to
austria
to
seek
for
traces
of
his
son
he
ordered
a
monument
from
moscow
which
he
intended
to
erect
in
his
own
garden
to
his
memory
and
he
told
everybody
that
his
son
had
been
killed
.
he
tried
not
to
change
his
former
way
of
life
but
his
strength
failed
him
.
he
walked
less
ate
less
slept
less
and
became
weaker
every
day
.
princess
mary
hoped
.
she
prayed
for
her
brother
as
living
and
was
al
ways
awaiting
news
of
his
return
.

the

her

from

as

in

the

of
every

even

in

now
the
smile
of
the

influ

by
the

mood
though
without

was
such
as
to
remind

still

of

the

and
the

began
to
cry
capriciously
like
a
suffering
child
and
to
wring
her
little
hands
even
with
some
affectation
.
princess

ran
out

to
fetch

she
heard
as
she
left
the
room
.
the
midwife
was
already
on
her
way
to
meet
her
rubbing
her
small
plump
white
hands
with
an
air
of
calm
importance
.

looking
at
the

wideopen

princess
said
mary
bogdnovna
not
hastening
her
steps
.

about

.
but
how

said
the
princess
.
in
accord
ance
with
lises
and
prince
andrews
wishes
they
had
sent
in
good
time
to
moscow
for
a
doctor
and
were
expecting

any
mo
ment
.
no
matter
princess
dont
be
alarmedsaid
mary
bogdnovna
.
well
manage
very
well
without
a
doctor
.
five
minutes
later
princess
mary
from
her
room
heard
something
heavy
being
carried
by
.
she
looked
out
.
the
menservants
were
carry
ing
the
large
leather
sofa
from
prince
an
drews
study
into
the
bedroom
.
on
their
faces
was
a
quiet
and
solemn
look
.
princess
mary
sat
alone
in
her
room
listen
ing
to
the
sounds
in
the
house
now
and
then
opening
her
door
when
someone
passed
and
watching
what
was
going
on
in
the
passage
.
some
women
passing
with
quiet
steps
in
and
out
of
the
bedroom
glanced
at
the
princess
and
turned
away
.
she
did
not
venture
to
ask
any
questions
and
shut
the
door
again
now
sitting
down
in
her
easy
chair
now
taking
her
prayer
book
now
kneeling
before
the
icon
stand
.
to
her
surprise
and
distress
she
found
that
her
prayers
did
not
calm
her
excitement
.
suddenly
her
door
opened
softly
and
her
old
nurse
pra
sk6vya
sdvishna
who
hardly
ever
came
to
that
room
as
the
old
prince
had
forbidden
it
ap
peared
on
the
threshold
with
a
shawl
round
her
head
.
ive
come
to
sit
with
you
a
bit
mdsha
said
the
nurse
and
here
ive
brought
the
princes
wedding
candles
to
light
before
his
saint
my
angel
she
said
with
a
sigh
.
oh
nurse
im
so
glad
god
is
merciful
birdie
.
the
nurse
lit
the
gilt
candles
before
the
icons
and
sat
down
by
the
door
with
her
knit
ting
.
princess
mary
took
a
book
and
began
reading
.
only
when
footsteps
or
voices
were
heard
did
they
look
at
one
another
the
prin
cess
anxious
and
inquiring
the
nurse
encour
aging
.
everyone
in
the
house
was
dominated
by
the
same
feeling
that
princess
mary
experi
enced
as
she
sat
in
her
room
.
but
owing
to
the
superstition
that
the
fewer
the
people
who
know
of
it
the
less
a
woman
in
travail
suffers
everyone
tried
to
pretend
not
to
know
no
one
spoke
of
it
but
apart
from
the
ordinary
staid
and
respectful
good
manners
habitual
in
the
princes
household
a
common
anxiety
a
softening
of
the
heart
and
a
consciousness
that
something
great
and
mysterious
was
be
ing
accomplished
at
that
moment
made
itself
felt
.
there
was
no
laughter
in
the
maids
large
hall
.
in
the
menservants
hall
all
sat
waiting
silently
and
alert
.
in
the
outlying
serfs
quar
ters
torches
and
candles
were
burning
and
no
one
slept
.
the
old
prince
stepping
on
his
heels
paced
up
and
down
his
study
and
sent
tikhon
to
ask
mary
bogddnovna
what
news
.
say
only
that
the
prince
told
me
to
ask
and
come
and
tell
me
her
answer
.
inform
the
prince
that
labor
has
begun
said
mary
bogddnovna
giving
the
messenger
a
significant
look
.
tfkhon
went
and
told
the
prince
.
very
good
said
the
prince
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
tikhon
did
not
hear
the
slightest
sound
from
the
study
after
that
.
after
a
while
he
reentered
it
as
if
to
snuff
the
candles
and
seeing
the
prince
was
lying
on
the
sofa
looked
at
him
noticed
his
per
turbed
face
shook
his
head
and
going
up
to
him
silently
kissed
him
on
the
shoulder
and
left
the
room
without
snuffing
the
candles
or
saying
why
he
had
entered
.
the
most
solemn
mystery
in
the
world
continued
its
course
.
evening
passed
night
came
and
the
feeling
of
suspense
and
softening
of
heart
in
the
presence
of
the
unfathomable
did
not
lessen
but
in
creased
.

a
relay
of
horses
had
been
sent
up
the
highroad
to
meet
the
german
doctor
from

who
was
expected
every
moment
and
men
on

with
lanterns
were
sent
to
the

to

suddenly
a

beat
violently

the

from

the

been

down
the
stock

she
was

to

leaning
out
tried
to

the
cold

flapped

ends
of

and
her
loose
locks
of

said
princess

princess
mary
threw
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
ran
to
meet
the
newcomer
.
as
she
was
crossing
the
anteroom
she
saw
through
the
window
a
carriage
with
lanterns
standing
at
the
entrance
.
she
went
out
on
the
stairs
.
on
a
baniter
post
stood
a
tallow
candle
which
gut
tered
in
the
draft
.
on
the
landing
below
philip
the
footman
stood
looking
scared
and
holding
another
candle
.
still
lower
beyond
the
turn
of
the
staircase
one
could
hear
the
footstep
of
someone
in
thick
felt
boots
and
a
voice
that
seemed
familiar
to
princess
mary
was
saying
something
.
thank
god
said
the
voice
.
and
father
gone
to
bed
replied
the
voice
of
demydn
the
house
steward
who
was
downstairs
.
then
the
voice
said
something
more
dem

replied
and
the
steps
in
the
felt
boots
ap
proached
the
unseen
bend
of
the
staircase
more
rapidly
.
its
andrew
thought
princess
mary
.
no
it
cant
be
that
would
be
too
extraordinary
and
at
the
very
moment
she
thought
this
the
face
and
figure
of
prince
andrew
in
a
fur
cloak
the
deep
collar
of
which
was
covered
with
snow
appeared
on

pale

with

and
strangely

agitated
expression
on

came
up

embraced

asked
and
not

for

he
would
not

received

unable

he
turned

had
entered

had
met
at

embraced

the

lay
supported
by
pillows
with
a

cap
on
her

the
pains
had
just
left
her
.
strands
of
her
black
hair
lay
round
her
inflamed
and
perspiring
cheeks
her
charming
rosy
mouth
with
its
downy
lip
was
open
and
she
was
smiling
joyfully
.
prince

entered
and
paused
facing
her
at
the
foot
of
the
sofa
on
which
she
was
lying
.
her
glitter
ing
eyes
filled
with
childlike
fear
and
excite

rested
on
him
without
changing
their
expression
.

love
you
all
and

her
look
seemed
to
say
.
she
saw
her
hus
band
but
did
not
realize
the
significance
of
his
appearance
before
her
now
.
prince

went
round
the

and
kissed
her

never

she
looked
at

with

the

began
again
and
mary

advised
prince
andrew
to
leave
the
room
.
the
doctor
entered
.
prince
andrew
went
out
and
meeting
princess
mary
again
joined
her
.
they
began
talking
in
whispers
but
their
talk
broke
off
at
every
moment
.
they
waited
and
listened
.

said
princess
mary
.
prince
andrew
went
again
to
his
wife
and
sat
waiting
in
the
room
next
to
hers
.
a
woman
came
from
the
bedroom
with
a
frightened
face
and
became
confused
when
she
saw
prince
an
drew
.
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
remained
so
for
some
minutes
.
piteous
help
less
animal
moans
came
through
the
door
.
prince
andrew
got
up
went
to
the
door
and
tried
to
open
it
.
someone
was
holding
it
shut
.
you
cant
come
in
you
cant
said
a
terri
fied
voice
from
within
.
he
began
pacing
the
room
.
the
screaming
ceased
and
a
few
more
seconds
went
by
.
then
suddenly
a
terrible
shriek
it
could
not
be
hers
she
could
not
scream
like
that
came
from
the
bedroom
.
prince
andrew
ran
to
the
door
the
scream
ceased
and
he
heard
the
wail
of
an
in
fant
.
what
have
they
taken
a
baby
in
there
for
thought
prince
andrew
in
the
first
second
.
a
baby
what
baby

.

.

.

why
is
there
a
baby
there
or
is
the
baby
born
then
suddenly
he
realized
the
joyful
signif
icance
of
that
wail
tears
choked
him
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
window
sill
be
began
to
cry
sobbing
like
a
child
.
the
door
opened
.
the
doctor
with
his
shirt
sleeves
tucked
up
without
a
coat
pale
and
with
a
trembling
jaw
came
out
of
the
room
.
prince
andrew
turned
to
him
but
the
doctor
gave
him
a
bewildered
look
and
passed
by
without
a
word
.
a
woman
rushed
out
and
seeing
prince
andrew
stopped
hesitating
on
the
threshold
.
he
went
into
his
wifes
room
.
she
was
lying
dead
in
the
same
position
he
had
seen
her
in
five
minutes
be
fore
and
despite
the
fixed
eyes
and
the
pallor
of
the
cheeks
the
same
expression
was
on
her
charming
childlike
face
with
its
upper
lip
cov
ered
with
tiny
black
hair
.
i
love
you
all
and
have
done
no
harm
to
anyone
and
what
have
you
done
to
me
said
her
charming
pathetic
dead
face
.
in
a
corner
of
the
room
something
red
and
tiny
gave
a
grunt
and
squealed
in
mary
bog
ddnovnas
trembling
white
hands
.
two
hours
later
prince
andrew
stepping
softly
went
into
his
fathers
room
.
the
old
man
already
knew
everything
.
he
was
stand
ing
close
to
the
door
and
as
soon
as
it
opened
his
rough
old
arms
closed
like
a
vise
round
his
sons
neck
and
without
a
word
he
began
to
sob
like
a
child
.
three
days
later
the
little
princess
was
buried
and
prince
andrew
went
up
the
steps
to
where
the
coffin
stood
to
give
her
the
farewell
kiss
.
and
there
in
the
coffin
was
the
same
face
though
with
closed
eyes
.
ah
what
have
you
done
to
me
it
still
seemed
to
say
and
prince
andrew
felt
that
something
gave
way
in
his
soul
and
that
he
was
guilty
of
a
sin
he
could
neither
remedy
nor
forget
.
he
could
not
weep
.
the
old
man
too
came
up
and
kissed
the
wax
en
little
hands
that
lay
quietly
crossed
one
on
the
other
on
her
breast
and
to
him
too
her
face
seemed
to
say
ah
what
have
you
done
to
me
and
why
and
at
the
sight
the
old
man
turned
angrily
away
.
another
five
days
passed
and
thentheyoung
prince
nicholas
andntevich
was
baptized
.
the
wet
nurse
supported
the
coverlet
with
her
chin
while
the
priest
with
a
goose
feather
anointed
the
boys
little
red
and
wrinkled
soles
and
palms
.
his
grandfather
who
was
his
godfather
trem
bling
and
afraid
of
dropping
him
carried
the
infant
round
the
battered
tin
font
and
handed
him
over
to
the
godmother
princess
mary
.
prince
andrew
sat
in
another
room
faint
with
fear
lest
the
baby
should
be
drowned
in
the
font
and
awaited
the
termination
of
the
cere
mony
.
he
looked
up
joyfully
at
the
baby
when
the
nurse
brought
it
to
him
and
nodded
ap
proval
when
she
told
him
that
the
wax
with
the
babys
hair
had
not
sunk
in
the
font
but
had
floated
.

d61okhovs
duel
with
be
ziikhov
was
hushed
up
by
the
efforts
of
the
old
count
and
instead
of
being
degraded
to
the
ranks
as
he
expected
he
was
appointed
an
ad
jutant
to
the
governor
general
of
moscow
.
as
a
result
he
could
not
go
to
the
country
with
the
rest
of
the
family
but
was
kept
all
summer
in
moscow
by
his
new
duties
.
d61okhov
recov
ered
and
rost6v
became
very
friendly
with
him
during
his
convalescence
.
d61okhov
lay
ill
at
his
mothers
who
loved
him
passionately
and
tenderly
and

who
had
grown
fond
of
rost6v
for
his
friendship
to
her

war

fdya
often
talked
to
him
about
her
son
.
yes

she
would
say
he
is
too
no
ble
and
puresouled
for
our
present
depraved
world
.
no
one
now
loves
virtue
it
seems
like
a
reproach
to
everyone
.
now
tell
me
count
was
it
right
was
it
honorable
of
beziikhov
and
fdya
with
his
noble
spirit
loved
him
and
even
now
never
says
a
word
against
him
.
those
pranks
in

when
they
played
some
tricks
on

fancy
what
he
had
to
go
through
its
true
he
has
been
reinstated
but
how
could
they
fail
to
do
that
i
think
there
were
not
many
such
gallant
sons
of
the
father
land
out
there
as
he
.
and
now
this
duel
have
these
people
no
feeling
or
honor
know
ing
him
to
be
an
only
son
to
challenge
him
and
shoot
so
straight
its
well
god
had
mercy
on
us
.
and
what
was
it
for
who
doesnt
have
intrigues
nowadays
why
if
he
was
so
jealous
as
i
see
things
he
should
have
shown
it
sooner
but
he
lets
it
go
on
for
months
.
and
then
to
call
him
out
reckoning
on
fdya
not
fighting
because
he
owed
him
money
what
baseness
what
meanness
i
know
you
understand
fed
ya
my
dear
count
that
believe
me
is
why
i
am
so
fond
of
you

few
people
do
understand
him
.
he
is
such
a
lofty
heavenly
soul
d61okhov
himself
during
his
convalescence
spoke
to
rost6v
in
a
way
no
one
would
have
expected
of
him
.
i
know
people
consider
me
a
bad
man
he
said
.
let
them
i
dont
care
a
straw
about
any
one
but
those
i
love
but
those
i
love
i
love
so
that
i
would
give
my
life
for
them
and
the
oth
ers
id
throttle
if
they
stood
in
my
way
.
i
have
an
adored
a
priceless
mother
and
two
or
three
friends
you
among
them
and
as
for
the
rest
i
only
care
about
them
in
so
far
as
they
are
harmful
or
useful
.
and
most
of
them
are
harm
ful
especially
the
women
.
yes
dear
boy
he
continued
i
have
met
loving
noble
high
minded
men
but
i
have
not
yet
met
any
wom
encountesses
or
cooks
who
were
not
venal
.
i
have
not
yet
met
that
divine
purity
and
devo
tion
i
look
for
in
women
.
if
i
found
such
a
one
id
give
my
life
for
her
but
those

.
and
he
made
a
gesture
of
contempt
.
and
believe
me
if
i
still
value
my
life
it
is
only
because
i
still
hope
to
meet
such
a
divine
creature
who
will
regenerate
purify
and
elevate
me
.
but
you
dont

in
the
autumn
the
rost6vs
returned
to
mos
cow
.
early
in
the
winter
denfsov
also
came
back
and
stayed
with
them
.
the
first
half
of
the
winter
of
1806
which
nicholas
rost6v
spent
in
moscow
was
one
of
the
happiest
mer
riest
times
for
him
and
the
whole
family
.
nich
olas
brought
many
young
men
to
his
parents
house
.
vera
was
a
handsome
girl
of
twenty
sdnya
a
girl
of
sixteen
with
all
the
charm
of
an
opening
flower
natdsha
half
grown
up
and
half
child
was
now
childishly
amusing
now
girlishly
enchanting
.
at
that
time
in
the
rost6vs
house
there
pre
vailed
an
amorous
atmosphere
characteristic
of
homes
where
there
are
very
young
and
very
charming
girls
.
every
young
man
who
came
to
the
house
seeing
those
impressionable
smil
ing
young
faces
smiling
probably
at
their
own
happiness
feeling
the
eager
bustle
around
him
and
hearing
the
fitful
bursts
of
song
and
music
and
the
inconsequent
but
friendly
prat
tle
of
young
girls
ready
for
anything
and
full
of
hope
experienced
the
same
feeling
shar
ing
with
the
young
folk
of
the
rost6vs
house
hold
a
readiness
to
fall
in
love
and
an
expecta
tion
of
happiness
.
among
the
young
men
introduced
byrost6v
one
of
the
first
was
d61okhov
whom
everyone
in
the
house
liked
except
natdsha
.
she
almost
quarreled
with
her
brother
about
him
.
she
in
sisted
that
he
was
a
bad
man
and
that
in
the
duel
with
beziikhov
pierre
was
right
and
d6
lokhov
wrong
and
further
that
he
was
disa
greeable
and
unnatural
.
theres
nothing
for
me
to
understand
she
cried
out
with
resolute
selfwill
he
is
wicked
and
heartless
.
there
now
i
like
your
denisov
though
he
is
a
rake
and
all
that
still
i
like
him
so
you
see
i
do
understand
.
i
dont
know
how
to
put
it

..
.
with
this
one
everything
is
calcu
lated
and
i
dont
like
that
.
but
denfsov

.

.

.
oh
denfsov
is
quite
different
replied
nicholas
implying
that
even
denfsov
was
noth
ing
compared
to
d61okhov
you
must
under
stand
what
a
soul
there
is
in
d61okhov
you
should
see
him
with
his
mother
.
whata
heart
well
i
dont
know
about
that
but
i
am
uncomfortable
with
him
.
and
do
you
know
he
has
fallen
in
love
with
s6nya
what
nonsense
.

.

.

.
im
certain
of
it
youll
see
.
natashas
prediction
proved
true
.
d61okhov
who
did
not
usually
care
for
the
society
of
la
dies
began
to
come
often
to
the
house
and
the
question
for
whose
sake
he
came
though
no
one
spoke
of
it
was
soon
settled
.
he
came
be
cause
of
s6nya
.
and
s6nya
though
she
would
never
have
dared
to
say
so
knew
it
and
blushed
scarlet
every
time
d61okhov
appeared
.
d61okhov
often
dined
at
the
rost6vs
never
missed
a
performance
at
which
they
were
pres
ent
and
went
to
logels
balls
for
young
people
which
the
rostovs
always
attended
.
he
was
pointedly
attentive
to
s6nya
and
looked
at
her
in
such
a
way
that
not
only
could
she
not
bear
his
glances
without
coloring
but
even
the
old
countess
and
natasha
blushed
when
they
saw
his
looks
.
it
was
evident
that
this
strange
strong
man
was
under
the
irresistible
influence
of
the
dark
graceful
girl
who
loved
another
.
rost6v
noticed
something
new
in
d61okhovs
relations
with
s6nya
but
he
did
not
explain
to
himself
what
these
new
relations
were
.
theyre
always
in
love
with
someone
he
thought
of
s6nya
and
natdsha
.
but
he
was
not
as
much
at
ease
with
s6nya
and
d61okhov
as
before
and
was
less
frequently
at
home
.
in
the
autumn
of
1806
everybody
had
again
begun
talking
of
the
war
with
napoleon
with
even
greater
warmth
than
the
year
before
.
or
ders
were
given
to
raise
recruits
ten
men
in
every
thousand
for
the
regular
army
and
be
sides
this
nine
men
in
every
thousand
for
the
militia
.
everywhere
bonaparte
was
anathema
tized
and
in
moscow
nothing
but
the
coming
war
was
talked
of
.
for
the
rostov
family
the
whole
interest
of
these
preparations
for
war
lay
in
the
fact
that
nicholas
would
not
hear
of
remaining
in
moscow
and
only
awaited
the
termination
of
denfsovs
furlough
afterchrist
mas
to
return
with
him
to
their
regiment
.
his
approaching
departure
did
not
prevent
his
amusing
himself
but
rather
gave
zest
to
his
pleasures
.
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
time
away
from
home
at
dinners
parties
and
balls
.

as
usual
exhausted
two
pairs
of
horses
without
visiting
all
the
places
he
meant
to
go
to
and
where
he
had
been
in
vited
returned
home
just
before
dinner
.
as
soon
as
he
entered
he
noticed
and
felt
the
ten
sion
of
the
amorous
air
in
the
house
and
also
noticed
a
curious
embarrassment
among
some
of
those
present
.
s6nya
d61okhov
and
the
old
countess
were
especially
disturbed
and
to
a
lesser
degree
natdsha
.
nicholas
understood
that
something
must
have
happened
between
s6n
ya
and
dolokhov
before
dinner
and
with
the
kindly
sensitiveness
natural
to
him
was
very
gentle
and
wary
with
them
both
at
dinner
.
on
that
same
evening
there
was
to
be
one
of
the
balls
that
logel
the
dancing
master
gave
for
his
pupils
durings
the
holidays
.
nicholas
will
you
come
to
logels
please
dol
said
natdsha
.
he
asked
you
and
vasfli
dmftrich

is
also
going
.
where
would
i
not
go
at
the
countess
com
mand
said
denfsov
who
at
the
rostovs
had
jocularly
assumed
the
role
of
natdshas
knight
.
im
even
weady
to
dance
the
pas
de
chdle
.
if
i
have
time
answered
nicholas
.
but
i
promised
the
arkhdrovs
they
have
a
party
.
and
you
he
asked
d61okhov
but
as
soon
as
he
had
asked
the
question
he
noticed
that
it
should
not
have
been
put
.
perhaps
coldly
and
angrily
replied
d6
lokhov
glancing
at
s6nya
and
scowling
he
gave
nicholas
just
such
a
look
as
he
had
given
pierre
at
the
club
dinner
.
there
is
something
up
thought
nicholas
and
he
was
further
confirmed
in
this
conclu
sion
by
the
fact
that
d61okhov
left
immediate
ly
after
dinner
.
he
called
natdsha
and
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
.
and
i
was
looking
for
you
said
natdsha
running
out
to
him
.
i
told
you
but
you
would
not
believe
it
she
said
triumphantly
.
he
has
proposed
to
s6nya
little
as
nicholas
had
occupied
himself
with
s6nya
of
late
something
seemed
to
give
way
within
him
at
this
news
.
d61okhov
was
a
suit
able
and
in
some
respects
a
brilliant
match
for
the
dowerless
orphan
girl
.
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
old
countess
and
of
society
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
her
to
refuse
him
.
and
therefore
nicholas
first
feeling
on
hearing
the
news
was
one
of
anger
with
sonya
.

.

.

.
he
tried
to
say
thats
capital
of
course
shell
forget
her
childish
promises
and
accept
the
offer
but
before
he
had
time
to
say
it
natdsha
began
again

war
and

fancy
she
refused
him
quite
definite
ly
adding
after
a
pause
she
told
him
she
loved
another
.
yes
my
s6nya

not

thought
nicholas
.
much
as
mamma
pressed
her
she
refused
and
i

she
wont
change
once
she

said

.

.
and
mamma
pressed
her
said
nicholas
reproachfully
.
yes
said
natdsha
.
do
you

i
know
you
will
not
marry
her
.
i
know
heaven

i

for
certain
that
you
wont

her
.
now
you

that
at
all
said
nich

but
i
must
talk
to
her
.
what
a
darling
s6nya
is
he
added
with
a
smile
.
ah
she
is
indeed
a
darling
ill
send
her
to
you
.
and
natasha
kissed
her
brother
and
ran
away
.
a
minute
later
s6nya
came
in
with
a
fright
ened
guilty
and
scared
look
.
nicholas
went
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
hand
.
this
was
the
first
time
since
his
return
that
they
had
talked
alone
and
about
their
love
.
sophie
he
began
timidly
at
first
and
then
more
and
more
boldly
if
you
wish
to
refuse
one
who
is
not
only
a
brilliant
and
advanta
geous
match
but
a
splendid
noble
fellow

.

.

.
he
is
my
friend

..
.
s6nya
interrupted
him
.
i
have
already
refused
she
said
hurriedly
.
if
you
are
refusing
for
my
sake
i
am
afraid
that
i

..
.
s6nya
again
interrupted
.
she
gave
him
an
imploring
frightened
look
.
nicholas
dont
tell
me
that
she
said
.
no
but
i
must
.
it
may
be
arrogant
of
me
but
still
it
is
best
to
say
it
.
if
you
refuse
him
on
my
account
i
must
tell
you
the
whole
truth
.
i
love
you
and
i
think
i
love
you
more
than
anyone
else
.

.

.

.
that
is
enough
for
me
said
s6nya
blush
ing
.
no
but
i
have
been
in
love
a
thousand
times
and
shall
fall
in
love
again
though
for
no
one
have
i
such
a
feeling
of
friendship
confidence
and
love
as
i
have
for
you
.
then
i
am
young
.
mamma
does
not
wish
it
.
in
a
word
i
make
no
promise
.
and
i
beg
you
to
consider
dolokhovs
offer
he
said
articulating
his
friends
name
with
difficulty
.
dont
say
that
to
me
i
want
nothing
.
i
love
you
as
a
brother
and
always
shall
and
i
want
nothing
more
.
you
are
an
angel
i
am
not
worthy
of
you
but
i
am
afraid
of
misleading
you

and
nicholas
again
kissed
her
hand
.
chapter
xii
iogels
were
the
most
enjoyable
balls
in
mos
cow
.
so
said
the
mothers
as
they
watched
their
young
people
executing
their
newly
learned
steps
and
so
said
the
youths
and
maidens
them
selves
as
they
danced
till
they
were
ready
to
drop
and
so
said
the
grownup
young
men
and
women
who
came
to
these
balls
with
an
air
of
condescension
and
found
them
most
enjoyable
.
that
year
two
marriages
had
come
of
these
balls
.
the
two
pretty
young
princesses
gor
chak6v
met
suitors
there
and
were
married
and
so
further
increased
the
fame
of
these
dances
.
what
distinguished
them
from
others
was
the
absence
of
host
or
hostess
and
the
presence
of
the
goodnatured
logel
flying
about
like
a
feather
and
bowing
according
to
the
rules
of
his
art
as
he
collected
the
tickets
from
all
his
visitors
.
there
was
the
fact
that
only
those
came
who
wished
to
dance
and
amuse
them
selves
as
girls
of
thirteen
and
fourteen
do
who
are
wearing
long
dresses
for
the
first
time
.
with
scarcely
any
exceptions
they
all
were
or
seemed
to
be
pretty
so
rapturous
were
their
smiles
and
so
sparkling
their
eyes
.
sometimes
the
best
of
the
pupils
of
whom
natasha
who
was
ex
ceptionally
graceful
was
first
even
danced
the
pas
de
chdle
but
at
this
last
ball
only
the
jcos
saise
the
anglaise
and
the
mazurka
which
was
just
coming
into
fashion
were
danced
logel
had
taken
a
ballroom
in
bezukhovs
house
and
the
ball
as
everyone
said
was
a
great
success
.
there
were
many
pretty
girls
and
the
rost6v
girls
were
among
the
prettiest
.
they
were
both
particularly
happy
and
gay
.
that
evening
proud
of
d61okhovs
proposal
her
refusal
and
her
explanation
with
nicholas
s6nya
twirled
about
before
she
left
home
so
that
the
maid
could
hardly
get
her
hair
plaited
and
she
was
transparently
radiant
with
impulsive
joy
.
natdsha
no
less
proud
of
her
first
long
dress
and
of
being
at
a
real
ball
was
even
happier
.
they
were
both
dressed
in
white
muslin
with
pink
ribbons
.
natdsha
fell
in
love
the
very
moment
she
en
tered
the
ballroom
.
she
was
not
in
love
with
anyone
in
particular
but
with
everyone
.
what
ever
person
she
happened
to
look
at
she
was
in
love
with
for
that
moment
.
oh
how
delightful
it
is
she
kept
saying
running
up
to
s6nya
.
nicholas
and
denisov
were
walking
up
and
book
four
187
down
looking
with
kindly
patronage
at
the
dancers
.
how
sweet
she
is
she
will
be
a

who
countess
natasha
answered
denisov
.
and
how
she
dances
what
gwace
he
said
again
after
a
pause
.
who
are
you
talking
about
about
your
sister
ejaculated
denisov
tes
tily
.
rost6v
smiled
.
my
dear
count
you
were
one
of
my
best
pu
pils
you
must
dance
said
little
logel
coming
up
to
nicholas
.
look
how
many
charming
young
ladies
he
turned
with
the
same
re
quest
to
denisov
who
was
also
a
former
pupil
of
his
.
no
my
dear
fellow
ill
be
a
wallflower
said
denisov
.
dont
you
wecollect
what
bad
use
i
made
of
your
lessons
oh
no
said
logel
hastening
to
reassure
him
.
you
were
only
inattentive
but
you
had
talentoh
yes
you
had
talent
the
band
struck
up
the
newly
introduced
mazurka
.
nicholas
could
not
refuse
logel
and
asked
s6nya
to
dance
.
denfsov
sat
down
by
the
old
ladies
and
leaning
on
his
saber
and
beat
ing
time
with
his
foot
told
them
something
funny
and
kept
them
amused
while
he
watched
the
young
people
dancing
logel
with
natdsha
his
pride
and
his
best
pupil
were
the
first
cou
ple
.
noiselessly
skillfully
stepping
with
his
lit
tle
feet
in
low
shoes
logel
flew
first
across
the
hall
with
natasha
who
though
shy
went
on
carefully
executing
her
steps
.
denfsov
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
and
beat
time
with
his
saber
in
a
way
that
clearly
indicated
that
if
he
was
not
dancing
it
was
because
he
would
not
and
not
because
he
could
not
.
in
the
middle
of
a
figure
he
beckoned
to
rost6v
who
was
passing
this
is
not
at
all
the
thing
he
said
.
what
sort
of
polish
mazuwka
is
this
but
she
does
dance
splendidly
.
knowing
that
denisov
had
a
reputation
even
in
poland
for
the
masterly
way
in
which
he
danced
the
mazurka
nicholas
ran
up
to
natasha
go
and
choose
denfsov
.
he
is
a
real
dancer
a
wonder
he
said
.
when
it
came
to
natdshas
turn
to
choose
a
partner
she
rose
and
tripping
rapidly
across
in
her
little
shoes
trimmed
with
bows
ran
tim
idly
to
the
corner
where
denfsov
sat
.
she
saw
that
everybody
was
looking
at
her
and
waiting
.
nicholas
saw
that
denfsov
was
refusing
though
he
smiled
delightedly
.
he
ran
up
to
them
.
please
vasfli
dmftrich
natdsha
was
say
ing
do
come
oh
no
let
me
off
countess
denfsov
re
plied
.
now
then
vdska
said
nicholas
.
they
coax
me
as
if
i
were
vdska
the
cat
said
denfsov
jokingly
.
ill
sing
for
you
a
whole
evening
said
na
tdsha
.
oh
the
faiwy
she
can
do
anything
with
me
said
denfsov
and
he
unhooked
his
saber
.
he
came
out
from
behind
the
chairs
clasped
his
partners
hand
firmly
threw
back
his
head
and
advanced
his
foot
waiting
for
the
beat
.
only
on
horse
back
and
in
the
mazurka
was
denfsovs
short
stature
not
noticeable
and
he
looked
the
fine
fellow
he
felt
himself
to
be
.
at
the
right
beat
of
the
music
he
looked
sideways
at
his
partner
with
a
merry
and
triumphant
air
suddenly
stamped
with
one
foot
bounded
from
the
floor
like
a
ball
and
flew
round
the
room
taking
his
partner
with
him
.
he
glided
silently
on
one
foot
half
across
the
room
and
seeming
not
to
notice
the
chairs
was
dashing
straight
at
them
when
suddenly
clinking
his
spurs
and
spreading
out
his
legs
he
stopped
short
on
his
heels
stood
so
a
second
stamped
on
the
spot
clanking
his
spurs
whirled
rapidly
round
and
striking
his
left
heel
against
his
right
flew
round
again
in
a
circle
.
natdsha
guessed
what
he
meant
to
do
and
abandoning
herself
to
him
followed
his
lead
hardly
know
ing
how
.
first
he
spun
her
round
holding
her
now
with
his
left
now
with
his
right
hand
then
falling
on
one
knee
he
twirled
her
round
him
and
again
jumping
up
dashed
so
impetuously
forward
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
rush
through
the
whole
suite
of
rooms
without
draw
ing
breath
and
then
he
suddenly
stopped
and
performed
some
new
and
unexpected
steps
.
when
at
last
smartly
whirling
his
partner
round
in
front
of
her
chair
he
drew
up
with
a
click
of
his
spurs
and
bowed
to
her
natasha
did
not
even
make
him
a
curtsy
.
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
in
amazement
smiling
as
if
she
did
not
recognize
him
.
what
does
this
mean
she
brought
out
.
although
logel
did
not
acknowledge
this
to
be
the
real
mazurka
everyone
was
delighted
with
denfsovs
skill
he
was
asked
again
and
again
as
a
partner
and
the
old
men
began
smil
ingly
to
talk
about
poland
and
the
good
old
days
.
denfsov
flushed
after
the
mazurka
and
mopping
himself
with
his
handkerchief
sat
i88
war
and
peace
down
by
natdsha
and
did
not
leave
her
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
chapter
xiii
for
two
days
after
that
rost6v
did
not
see
d61okhov
at
his
own
or
at
d61okhovs
home
on
the
third
day
he
received
a
note
from
him
as
i
do
not
intend
to
be
at
your
house
again
for
reasons
you
know
of
and
am
going
to
rejoin
my
regiment
i
am
giving
a
farewell
supper
tonight
to
my
friendscome
to
the
english
hotel
.
about
ten
oclock
rost6v
went
to
the
english
hotel
straight
from
the
theater
where
he
had
been
with
his
family
and
denisov
.
he
was
at
once
shown
to
the
best
room
which
d61okhov
had
taken
for
that
evening
.
some
twenty
men
were
gathered
round
a
table
at
which
d61ok
hov
sat
between
two
candles
.
on
the
table
was
a
pile
of
gold
and
paper
money
and
he
was
keeping
the
bank
.
rost6v
had
not
seen
him
since
his
proposal
and
s6nyas
refusal
and
felt
uncomfortable
at
the
thought
of
how
they
would
meet
.
d61okhovs
clear
cold
glance
met
rost6v
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
door
as
though
he
had
long
expected
him
.
its
a
long
time
since
we
met
he
said
.
thanks
for
coming
.
ill
just
finish
dealing
and
then
ilyiishka
will
come
with
his
chorus
.
i
called
once
or
twice
at
your
house
said
rost6v
reddening
.
d61okhov
made
no
reply
.
you
may
punt
he
said
.
rost6v
recalled
at
that
moment
a
strange
conversation
he
had
once
had
with
d61okhov
.
none
but
fools
trust
to
luck
in
play
d61ok
hov
had
then
said
.
or
are
you
afraid
to
play
with
me
d61ok
hov
now
asked
as
if
guessing
rost6vs
thought
.
beneath
his
smile
rostov
saw
in
him
the
mood
he
had
shown
at
the
club
dinner
and
at
other
times
when
as
if
tired
of
everyday
life
he
had
felt
a
need
to
escape
from
it
by
some
strange
and
usually
cruel
action
.
rost6v
felt
ill
at
ease
.
he
tried
but
failed
to
find
some
joke
with
which
to
reply
to
d61ok
hovs
words
.
but
before
he
had
thought
of
any
thing
d61okhov
looking
straight
in
his
face
said
slowly
and
deliberately
so
that
everyone
could
hear
do
you
remember
we
had
a
talk
about
cards

.

.

.
hes
a
fool
who
trusts
to
luck
one
should
make
certain
and
i
want
to
try
.
to
try
his
luck
or
the
certainty
rostov
asked
himself
.
well
youd
better
not
play
d61okhov
added
and
springing
a
new
pack
of
cards
said
bank
gentlemen
moving
the
money
forward
he
prepared
to
deal
.
rost6v
sat
down
by
hi
side
and
at
first
did
not
play
.
d61okhov
kept
glancing
at
him
.
why
dont
you
play
he
asked
.
and
strange
to
say
nicholas
felt
that
he
could
not
help
taking
up
a
card
putting
a
small
stake
on
it
and
beginning
to
play
.
i
have
no
money
with
me
he
said
.
ill
trust
you
.
rost6v
staked
five
rubles
on
a
card
and
lost
staked
again
and
again
lost
.
d61okhov
killed
that
is
beat
ten
cards
of
rost6vs
running
.
gentlemen
said
dolokhov
after
he
had
dealt
for
some
time
.
please
place
your
money
on
the
cards
or
i
may
get
muddled
in
the
reck
oning
.
one
of
the
players
said
he
hoped
he
might
be
trusted
.
yes
you
might
but
i
am
afraid
of
getting
the
accounts
mixed
.
so
i
ask
you
to
put
the
money
on
your
cards
replied
d61okhov
.
dont
stint
yourself
well
settle
afterwards
he
added
turning
to
rost6v
.
the
game
continued
a
waiter
kept
handing
round
champagne
.
all
rost6vs
cards
were
beaten
and
he
had
eight
hundred
rubles
scored
up
against
him
.
he
wrote
800
rubles
on
a
card
but
while
the
waiter
filled
his
glass
he
changed
his
mind
and
altered
it
to
his
usual
stake
of
twenty
rubles
.
leave
it
said
dolokhov
though
he
did
not
seem
to
be
even
looking
at
rostov
youll
win
it
back
all
the
sooner
.
i
lose
to
the
others
but
win
from
you
.
or
are
you
afraid
of
me
he
asked
again
.
rost6v
submitted
.
he
let
the
eight
hundred
remain
and
laid
down
a
seven
of
hearts
with
a
torn
corner
which
he
had
picked
up
from
the
floor
.
he
well
remembered
that
seven
after
wards
.
he
laid
down
the
seven
of
hearts
on
which
with
a
broken
bit
of
chalk
he
had
writ
ten
800
rubles
in
clear
upright
figures
he
emptied
the
glass
of
warm
champagne
that
was
handed
him
smiled
at
d61okhovs
words
and
with
a
sinking
heart
waiting
for
a
seven
to
turn
up
gazed
at
d61okhovs
hands
which
held
the
pack
.
much
depended
on
rost6vs
win
ning
or
losing
on
that
seven
of
hearts
.
on
the
previous
sunday
the
old
count
had
given
his
son
two
thousand
rubles
and
though
he
al
ways
disliked
speaking
of
money
difficulties
had
told
nicholas
that
this
was
all
he
could
let
book
him
have
till
may
and
asked
him
to
be
more
economical
this
time
.
nicholas
had
replied
that
it
would
be
more
than
enough
for
him
and
that
he
gave
his
word
of
honor
not
to
take
anything
more
till
the
spring
.
now
only
twelve
hundred
rubles
was
left
of
that
money
so
that
this
seven
of
hearts
meant
for
him
not
only
the
loss
of
sixteen
hundred
rubles
but
the
neces
sity
of
going
back
on
his
word
.
with
a
sinking
heart
he
watched
d61okhovs
hands
and
thought
now
then
make
haste
and
let
me
have
this
card
and
ill
take
my
cap
and
drive
home
to
supper
with
denfsov
natdsha
and
s6nya
and
will
certainly
never
touch
a
card
again
.
at
that
moment
his
home
life
jokes
with
ptya
talks
with
s6nya
duets
with
natd
sha
piquet
with
his
father
and
even
his
com
fortable
bed
in
the
house
on
the
povarskaya
rose
before
him
with
such
vividness
clearness
and
charm
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
all
a
lost
and
unappreciated
bliss
long
past
.
he
could
not
conceive
that
a
stupid
chance
letting
the
seven
be
dealt
to
the
right
rather
than
to
the
left
might
deprive
him
of
all
this
happiness
newly
appreciated
and
newly
illumined
and
plunge
him
into
the
depths
of
unknown
and
undefined
misery
.
that
could
not
be
yet
he
awaited
with
a
sinking
heart
the
movement
of
d61okhovs
hands
.
those
broad
reddish
hands
with
hairy
wrists
visible
from
under
the
shirt
cuffs
laid
down
the
pack
and
took
up
a
glass
and
a
pipe
that
were
handed
him
.
so
you
are
not
afraid
to
play
with
me
re
peated
d61okhov
and
as
if
about
to
tell
a
good
story
he
put
down
the
cards
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
began
deliberately
with
a
smile
yes
gentlemen
ive
been
told
theres
a
ru
mor
going
about
moscow
that
im
a
sharper
so
i
advise
you
to
be
careful
.
come
now
deal
i
exclaimed
rost6v
.
oh
those
moscow
gossips
said
d61okhov
and
he
took
up
the
cards
with
a
smile
.
aah
rost6v
almost
screamed
lifting
both
hands
to
his
head
.
the
seven
he
needed
was
ly
ing
uppermost
the
first
card
in
the
pack
.
he
had
lost
more
than
he
could
pay
.
still
dont
ruin
yourself
1
said
d61okhov
with
a
side
glance
at
rost6v
as
he
continued
to
deal
.
chapter
xiv
an
hour
and
a
half
later
most
of
the
players
were
but
little
interested
in
their
own
play
.
the
whole
interestwas
concentrated
on
ros
t6v
.
instead
of
sixteen
hundred
rubles
he
had
a
long
column
of
figures
scored
against
him
four
189
which
he
had
reckoned
up
to
ten
thousand
but
that
now
as
he
vaguely
supposed
must
have
risen
to
fifteen
thousand
.
in
reality
it
al
ready
exceeded
twenty
thousand
rubles
.
d6
lokhov
was
no
longer
listening
to
stories
or
telling
them
but
followed
every
movement
of
rostovs
hands
and
occasionally
ran
his
eyes
over
the
score
against
him
.
he
had
decided
to
play
until
that
score
reached
fortythree
thou
sand
.
he
had
fixed
on
that
number
because
fortythree
was
the
sum
of
his
and
s6nyas
joint
ages
.
rost6v
leaning
his
head
on
both
hands
sat
at
the
table
which
was
scrawled
over
with
figures
wet
with
spilled
wine
and
littered
with
cards
.
one
tormenting
impression
did
not
leave
him
that
those
broad
boned
reddish
hands
with
hairy
wrists
visible
from
under
the
shirt
sleeves
those
hands
which
he
loved
and
hated
held
him
in
their
power
.
six
hundred
rubles
ace
a
corner
a
nine

.

.

.
winning
it
backs
impossible

.

.

.
oh
how
pleasant
it
was
at
home
i

.

.

.
the
knave
double
or
quits

..
.
it
cant
bel

.

.

.
and
why
is
he
doing
this
to
me
rostov
pondered
.
sometimes
he
staked
a
large
sum
but
drilokhov
refused
to
accept
it
and
fixed
the
stake
himself
.
nicholas
submitted
to
him
and
at
one
moment
prayed
to
god
as
he
had
done
on
the
battlefield
at
the
bridge
over
the
enns
and
then
guessed
that
the
card
that
came
first
to
hand
from
the
crum
pled
heap
under
the
table
would
save
him
now
counted
the
cords
on
his
coat
and
took
a
card
with
that
number
and
tried
staking
the
total
of
his
losses
on
it
then
he
looked
round
for
aid
from
the
other
players
or
peered
at
the
now
cold
face
of
d61okhov
and
tried
to
read
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
.
he
knows
of
course
what
this
loss
means
to
me
.
he
cant
want
my
ruin
.
wasnt
he
my
friend
wasnt
i
fond
of
him
but
its
not
his
fault
.
whats
he
to
do
if
he
has
such
luck

.

.

.
and
its
not
my
fault
either
he
thought
to
himself
i
have
done
nothing
wrong
.
have
i
killed
anyone
or
insulted
or
wished
harm
to
anyone
why
such
a
terrible
misfortune
and
when
did
it
begin
such
a
little
while
ago
1
came
to
this
table
with
the
thought
of
winning
a
hundred
rubles
to
buy
that
casket
for
mam
mas
name
day
and
then
going
home
.
i
was
so
happy
so
free
so
lightheartedl
and
i
did
not
realize
how
happy
i
was
when
did
that
end
and
when
did
this
new
terrible
state
of
things
begin
what
marked
the
change
i
sat
all
the
time
in
this
same
place
at
this
table
chose
and
placed
cards
and
watched
those
broadboned
agile
hands
in
the
same
way
.
when
did
it
hap
igo
war
and
peace
pen
and
what
has
happened
i
am
well
and
strong
and
still
the
same
and
in
the
same
place
.
no
it
cant
be
surely
it
will
all
end
in
noth
ing
he
was
flushed
and
bathed
in
perspiration
though
the
room
was
not
hot
.
his
face
was
ter
rible
and
piteous
to
see
especially
from
its
helpless
efforts
to
seem
calm
.
the
score
against
him
reached
the
fateful
sum
of
fortythree
thousand
.
rost6v
had
just
prepared
a
card
by
bending
the
corner
of
which
he
meant
to
double
the
three
thousand
just
put
down
to
his
score
when
d61okhov
slamming
down
the
pack
of
cards
put
it
aside
and
began
rapidly
adding
up
the
total
of
ros
t6vs
debt
breaking
the
chalk
as
he
marked
the
figures
in
his
clear
bold
hand
.
supper
its
time
for
supper
and
here
are
the
gypsies
some
swarthy
men
and
women
were
really
entering
from
the
cold
outside
and
saying
some
thing
in
their
gypsy
accents
.
nicholas
under
stood
that
it
was
all
over
but
he
said
in
an
in
different
tone
well
wont
you
go
on
i
had
a
splendid
card
all
ready
as
if
it
were
the
fun
of
the
game
which
interested
him
most
.
its
all
up
im
lost
thought
he
.
now
a
bullet
through
my
brainthats
all
thats
left
me
and
at
the
same
time
he
said
in
a
cheer
ful
voice
come
now
just
this
one
more
little
card
all
right
said
d61okhov
having
finished
the
addition
.
all
right
twentyone
rubles
he
said
pointing
to
the
figure
twentyone
by
which
the
total
exceeded
the
round
sum
of
fortythree
thousand
and
taking
up
a
pack
he
prepared
to
deal
.
rost6v
submissively
unbent
the
corner
of
his
card
and
instead
of
the
six
thousand
he
had
intended
carefully
wrote
twentyone
.
its
all
the
same
to
me
he
said
.
i
only
want
to
see
whether
you
will
let
me
win
this
ten
or
beat
it
.
d61okhov
began
to
deal
seriously
.
oh
how
rost6v
detested
at
that
moment
those
hands
with
their
short
reddish
fingers
and
hairy
wrists
which
held
him
in
their
power
.

.

.

.
the
ten
fell
to
him
.
you
owe
fortythree
thousand
count
said
d61okhov
and
stretching
himself
he
rose
from
the
table
.
one
does
get
tired
sitting
so
long
he
added
.
yes
im
tired
too
said
rost6v
.
d61okhov
cut
him
short
as
if
to
remind
him
that
it
was
not
for
him
to
jest
.
when
am
i
to
receive
the
money
count
rost6v
flushing
drew
d61okhov
into
the
next
room
.
i
cannot
pay
it
all
immediately
.
will
you
take
an
i
.o
.u
.
he
said
.
i
say
rost6v
said
d61okhov
clearly
smil
ing
and
looking
nicholas
straight
in
the
eyes
you
know
the
saying
lucky
in
love
unlucky
at
cards
.
your
cousin
is
in
love
with
you
i
know
.
oh
its
terrible
to
feel
oneself
so
in
this
mans
power
thought
rost6v
.
he
knew
what
a
shock
he
would
inflict
on
his
father
and
mother
by
the
news
of
this
loss
he
knew
what
a
relief
it
would
be
to
escape
it
all
and
felt
that
dolokhov
knew
that
he
could
save
him
from
all
this
shame
and
sorrow
but
wanted
now
to
play
with
him
as
a
cat
does
with
a
mouse
.
your
cousin

.

.

.
d61okhov
started
to
say
but
nicholas
interrupted
him
.
my
cousin
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
and
its
not
necessary
to
mention
her
he
ex
claimed
fiercely
.
then
when
am
i
to
have
it
tomorrow
replied
rost6v
and
left
the
room
.
chapter
xv
to
say
tomorrow
and
keep
up
a
dignified
tone
was
not
difficult
but
to
go
home
alone
see
his
sisters
brother
mother
and
father
con
fess
and
ask
for
money
he
had
no
right
to
after
giving
his
word
of
honor
was
terrible
.
at
home
they
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
.
the
young
people
after
returning
from
the
theater
had
had
supper
and
were
grouped
round
the
clavichord
.
as
soon
as
nicholas
entered
he
was
enfolded
in
that
poetic
atmosphere
of
love
which
pervaded
the
rost6v
household
that
winter
and
now
after
d61okhovs
proposal
and
logels
ball
seemed
to
have
grown
thicker
round
s6nya
and
natdsha
as
the
air
does
be
fore
a
thunderstorm
.
s6nya
and
natasha
in
the
lightblue
dresses
they
had
worn
at
the
theater
looking
pretty
and
conscious
of
it
were
standing
by
the
clavichord
happy
and
smiling
.
vera
was
playing
chess
with
shinshin
in
the
drawing
room
.
the
old
countess
wait
ing
for
the
return
of
her
husband
and
son
sat
playing
patience
with
the
old
gentlewoman
who
lived
in
their
house
.
denfsov
with
spar
kling
eyes
and
ruffled
hair
sat
at
the
clavichord
striking
chords
with
his
short
fingers
his
legs
thrown
back
and
his
eyes
rolling
as
he
sang
with
his
small
husky
but
true
voice
some
book
four
verses
called
enchantress
which
he
had
com
posed
and
to
which
he
was
trying
to
fit
music
enchantress
say
to
my
forsaken
lyre
what
magic
power
is
this
recalls
me
still
what
spark
has
set
my
inmost
soul
on
fire
what
is
this
bliss
that
makes
my
fingers
thrill
he
was
singing
in
passionate
tones
gazing
with
his
sparkling
blackagate
eyes
at
the
frightened
and
happy
natdsha
.
splendid
excellent
exclaimed
natdsha
.
another
verse
she
said
without
noticing
nicholas
.
everythings
still
the
same
with
them
thought
nicholas
glancing
into
the
drawing
room
where
he
saw
vra
and
his
mother
with
the
old
lady
.
ah
and
heres
nicholas
cried
natdsha
running
up
to
him
.

home
he
asked
.
i
am
so
glad
youve
come
said
natdsha
without
answering
him
.
we

joying

selves
vasfli
dmftrich

staying
a
day
longer
for
my
sake
did

said
s6nya
.
nicholas
have
you
come
come
here
dear
called
the
old
countess
from
the
draw
ing
room
.
nicholas
went
to
her
kissed
her
hand
and
sitting
down
silently
at
her
table
began
to
watch
her
hands
arranging
the
cards
.
from
the
dancing
room
they
still
heard
the
laughter
and
merry
voices
trying
to
persuade
natdsha
to
sing
.
all
wight
all
wight
shouted
denfsov
.
its
no
good
making
excuses
now
its
your
turn
to
sing
the
bacawolla
i
entweat
you
the
countess
glanced
at
her
silent
son
.
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
.
oh
nothing
said
he
as
if
weary
of
being
continually
asked
the
same
question
.
will
papa
be
back
soon
i
expect
so
.
everythings
the
same
with
them
.
they
know
nothing
about
it
where
am
i
to
go
thought
nicholas
and
went
again
into
the
dancing
room
where
the
clavichord
stood
.
s6nya
was
sitting
at
the
clavichord
playing
the
prelude
to
denfsovs
favorite
barcarolle
.
natdsha
was
preparing
to
sing
.
denfsov
was
looking
at
her
with
enraptured
eyes
.
nicholas
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
.
why
do
they
want
to
make
her
sing
how
can
she
sing
theres
nothing
to
be
happy
about
i

thought
he
.
s6nya
struck
the
first
chord
of
the
prelude
.
my
god
im
a
ruined
and
dishonored
man
a
bullet
through
my
brain
is
the
only
thing
left
me
not
singing
his
thoughts
ran
on
.
go
away
but
where
to
its
all
one
let
them
sing
he
continued
to
pace
the
room
looking
gloomily
at
denfsov
and
the
girls
and
avoiding
their
eyes
.
nik61enka
what
is
the
matter
s6nyas
eyes
fixed
on
him
seemed
to
ask
.
she
noticed
at
once
that
something
had
happened
to
him
.
nicholas
turned
away
from
her
.
natdsha
too
with
her
quick
instinct
had
instantly
noticed
her
brothers
condition
.
but
though
she
no
ticed
it
she
was
herself
in
such
high
spirits
at
that
moment
so
far
from
sorrow
sadness
or
selfreproach
that
she
purposely
deceived
her
self
as
young
people
of
ten
do
.
no
i
am
too
hap
py
now
to
spoil
my
enjoyment
by
sympathy
with
anyones
sorrow
she
felt
and
she
said
to
her
self
no
i
must
be
mistaken
he
must
be
feel
ing
happy
just
as
i
am
.
now
sonya
she
said
going
to
the
very
middle
of
the
room
where
she
considered
the
resonance
was
best
.
having
lifted
her
head
and
let
her
arms
droop
lifelessly
as
ballet
dancers
do
natdsha
rising
energetically
from
her
heels
to
her
toes
stepped
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
stood
still
.
yes
thats
mesheseemed
to
say
answering
the
rapt
gaze
with
which
denfsov
followed
her
.
and
what
is
she
so
pleased
about
thought
nicholas
looking
at
his
sister
.
why
isnt
she
dull
and
ashamed
natdsha
took
the
first
note
her
throat
swelled
her
chest
rose
her
eyes
became
serious
.
at
that
moment
she
was
oblivious
of
her
sur
roundings
and
from
her
smiling
lips
flowed
sounds
which
anyone
may
produce
at
the
same
intervals
and
hold
for
the
same
time
but
which
leave
you
cold
a
thousand
times
and
the
thou
sand
and
first
time
thrill
you
and
make
you
weep
.
natdsha
that
winter
had
for
the
first
time
begun
to
sing
seriously
mainly
because
den
fsov
so
delighted
in
her
singing
.
she
no
longer
sang
as
a
child
there
was
no
longer
in
her
sing
ing
that
comical
childish
painstaking
effect
that
had
been
in
it
before
but
she
did
not
yet
sing
well
as
all
the
connoisseurs
who
heard
her
said
it
is
not
trained
but
it
is
a
beautiful
voice
that
must
be
trained
.
only
they
gener
ally
said
this
some
time
after
she
had
finished
singing
.
while
that
untrained
voice
with
its
incorrect
breathing
and
labored
transitions
war
and
peace
was
sounding
even
the
connoisseurs
said
noth
ing
but
only
delighted
in
it
and
wished
to
hear
it
again
.
in
her
voice
there
was
a
virginal
freshness
an
unconsciousness
of
her
own
pow
ers
and
an
as
yet
untrained
velvety
softness
which
so
mingled
with
her
lack
of
art
in
sing
ing
that
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
in
that
voice
could
be
altered
without
spoiling
it
.
what
is
this
thought
nicholas
listening
to
her
with
widely
opened
eyes
.
what
has
happened
to
her
how
she
is
singing
today
1
and
suddenly
the
whole
world
centered
for
him
on
anticipation
of
the
next
note
the
next
phrase
and
everything
in
the
world
was
di
vided
into
three
beats
oh

nicholas

all
this

d61okhov
and
anger
and

its
all
nonsense

.

but
this
is
real
.

.

.

.
now
then
natdsha
now
then
dearest
now
then
darling
how
will
she
take
that
si
shes
taken
it
thank
god
and
without
noticing
that
he
was
singing
to
strengthen
the
si
he
sung
a
second
a
third
below
the
high
note
.
ah
god
how
fine
did
i
really
take
it
how
fortunate
he
thought
.
oh
how
that
chord
vibrated
and
how
moved
was
something
that
was
finest
in
rostovs
soul
and
this
something
was
apart
from
everything
else
in
the
world
and
above
everything
in
the
world
.
what
were
losses
and
d61okhov
and
words
of
honor

.

.

.
all
nonsense
one
might
kill
and
rob
and
yet
be
happy

chapter
xvi
it
was
long
since
rost6v
had
felt
such
enjoy
ment
from
music
as
he
did
that
day
.
but
no
sooner
had
natdsha
finished
her
barcarolle
than
reality
again
presented
itself
.
he
got
up
without
saying
a
word
and
went
downstairs
to
his
own
room
.
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
old
count
came
in
from
his
club
cheerful
and
contented
.
nicholas
hearing
him
drive
up
went
to
meet
him
.
well
had
a
good
time
said
the
old
count
smiling
gaily
and
proudly
at
his
son
.
nicholas
tried
to
say
yes
but
could
not
and
he
nearly
burst
into
sobs
.
the
count
was
lighting
his
pipe
and
did
not
notice
his
sons
condition
.
ah
it
cant
be
avoided
thought
nicholas
for
the
first
and
last
time
.
and
suddenly
in
the
most
casual
tone
which
made
him
feel
ashamed
of
himself
he
said
as
if
merely
asking
his
fa
ther
to
let
him
have
the
carriage
to
drive
to
town
papa
i
have

i

nearly
forgetting

said
his
father
who
was
in
a
spe
cially
good
humor
.
i
told
you
it
would
not
be
enough
.
how
much
very
much
said
nicholas
flushing
and
with
a
stupid
careless
smile
for
which
he
was
long
unable
to
forgive
himself
i
have
lost

i

a
good
deal
a
great
deal
forty
three
thousand
.
what

.

.

cried
the
count
suddenly
reddening
with
an
apoplectic
flush
over
neck
and
nape
as
old
people
do
.
i
promised
to
pay
tomorrow
said
nicho

.said
the
old
count
spreading
out
his
arms
and
sinking
helplessly
on
the
sofa
.
it
cant
behelped
it
happens
toeveryone
said
the
son
with
a
bold
free
and
easy
tone
while
in
his
soul
he
regarded
himself
as
a
worthless
scoundrel
whose
whole
life
could
not
atone
for
his
crime
.
he
longed
to
kiss
his
fa
thers
hands
and
kneel
to
beg
his
forgiveness
but
said
in
a
careless
and
even
rude
voice
that
it
happens
to
everyone
the
old
count
cast
down
his
eyes
on
hearing
his
sons
words
and
began
bustlingly
searching
for
something
.
yes
yes
he
muttered
it
will
be
difficult
i
fear
difficult
to
raise

.

.

.
happens
to
every
body
yes
who
has
not
done
it
and
with
a
furtive
glance
at
his
sons
face
the
count
went
out
of
the
room
.

.

.

.
nicholas
had
been
prepared
for
resistance
but
had
not
at
all
expected
this
.
papa
papa
he
called
after
him
sobbing
forgive
me
and
seizing
his
fathers
hand
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
burst
into
tears
.
while
father
and
son
were
having
their
ex
planation
the
mother
and
daughter
were
hav
ing
one
not
less
important
.
natdsha

shoulders
.

with

.

.

door
and
natasha
ran
across
the
drawing
room
to
the
dancing
hall
where
denfsov
was
sitting
on
the
same
chair
by
the
clavichord
with
his
face
in
his
hands
.
he
jumped
up
at
the
sound
of
her
light
step

nataly
he
said

denlsov
bent
over
her
hand
and
she
heard
strange
sounds
she
did
not
understand
.
she
kissed
his
rough
curly
black
head
.
at
this
in

they
heard
the
quick
rustle
of

she
came
up

them

thankyou
for
the

she
said
with
an
embarrassed
voice
though
it
sounded
severe
to
denlsov
but
my
daughter
is
so
young
and
i
thought
that
as
my
sons
friend
you
would
have
addressed
yourself
first
to

in

you
would
not

said
denfsov
with
downcast
eyes
and
a
guilty
face
.
he
tried
to
say
more
but
faltered
.
natasha
could
not
remain
calm
seeing
him
in
such
a
plight
.
she
began
to
sob
aloud
.

i
have
done

denfsov
went
on
in
an
unsteady
voice
but
believe
me
i
so
adore
your

and
all
your

that
i
would
give
my
life
twice
over

.

.
he
looked
at
the
countess
and
seeing
her
severe
face
said
well
goodby
countess
and
kiss
ing
her
hand
he
left
the
room
with
quick
reso
lute
strides
without
looking
at
natasha
.
next
day
rost6vsaw
denfsov
off
.
he
did
not
wish
to
stay
another
day
in
moscow
.
all
denf
sovs
moscow
friends
gave
him
a
farewell
en
tertainment
at
the
gypsies
with
the
result
that
he
had
no
recollection
of
how
he
was
put
in
the
sleigh
or
of
the
first
three
stages
of
his
journey
.
after
denfsovs
departure
rost6v
spent
an
other
fortnight
in
moscow
without
going
out
of
the
house
waiting
for
the
money
his
father
could
not
at
once
raise
and
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
girls
room
.
s6nya
was
more
tender
and
devoted
to
him
than
ever
.
it
was
as
if
she
wanted
to
show
him
that
his
losses
were
an
achievement
that
made
her
love
him
all
the
more
but
nicholas
now
considered
himself
unworthy
of
her
.
he
filled
the
girls
albums
with
verses
and
music
and
having
at
last
sent
d61okhov
the
whole
fortythree
thousand
rubles
and
received
his
receipt
he
left
at
the
end
of
november
without
taking
leave
of
any
of
his
acquaint
ances
to
overtake
his
regiment
which
was
al
ready
in

book

180607
chapter
i
after
his
interview
with
his
wife
pierre
left
for
petersburg
.
at
the
torzh6k
post
station
either
there
were
no
horses
or
the
postmaster
would
not
supply
them
.
pierre
was
obliged
to
wait
.
without
undressing
he
lay
down
on
the
leather
sofa
in
front
of
a
round
table
put
his
big
feet
in
their
overboots
on
the
table
and
began
to
reflect
.
will
you
have
the
portmanteaus
brought
in
and
a
bed
got
ready
and
tea
asked
his
valet
.
pierre
gave
no
answer
for
he
neither
heard
nor
saw
anything
.
he
had
begun
to
think
of
the
last
station
and
was
still
pondering
on
the
same
question
one
so
important
that
he
took
no
notice
of
what
went
on
around
him
.
not
only
was
he
indifferent
as
to
whether
he
got
to
petersburg
earlier
or
later
or
whether
he
se
cured
accommodation
at
this
station
but
com
pared
to
the
thoughts
that
now
occupied
him
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
he
re
mained
there
for
a
few
hours
or
for
the
rest
of
his
life
.
the
postmaster
his
wife
the
valet
and
a
peasant
woman
selling
torzh6k
embroidery
came
into
the
room
offering
their
services
.
without
changing
his
careless
attitude
pierre
looked
at
them
over
his
spectacles
unable
to
understand
what
they
wanted
or
how
they
could
go
on
living
without
having
solved
the
problems
that
so
absorbed
him
.
he
had
been
engrossed
by
the
same
thoughts
ever
since
the
day
he
returned
from
sok61niki
after
the
duel
and
had
spent
that
first
agonizing
sleepless
night
.
but
now
in
the
solitude
of
the
journey
they
seized
him
with
special
force
.
no
matter
what
he
thought
about
he
always
returned
to
these
same
questions
which
he
could
not
solve
and
yet
could
not
cease
to
ask
himself
.
it
was
as
if
the
thread
of
the
chief
screw
which
held
his
life
together
were
stripped
so
that
thescrew
could
not
get
in
or
out
but
went
on
turning
uselessly
in
the
same
place
.
the
postmaster
came
in
and
began
obse
quiously
to
beg
his
excellency
to
wait
only
two
hours
when
come
what
might
he
would
let
his
excellency
have
the
courier
horses
.
it
was
plain
that
he
was
lying
and
only
wanted
to
get
more
money
from
the
traveler
.
is
this
good
or
bad
pierre
asked
himself
.
it
is
good
for
me
bad
for
another
traveler
and
for
himself
its
unavoidable
because
he
needs
money
for
food
the
man
said
an
officer
had
once
given
him
a
thrashing
for
letting
a
private
traveler
have
the
courier
horses
.
but
the
officer
thrashed
him
because
he
had
to
get
on
as
quickly
as
possible
.
and
i
continued
pierre
shot
dolokhov
because
i
considered
myself
injured
and
louis
xvi
was
executed
because
they
considered
him
a
criminal
and
a
year
later
they
executed
those
who
executed
him
also
for
some

the
torzh6k

in
a
whining

went
on
offering

a

of

in

looking

at

he
thought
.
and

she
want
the
money
for
as
if
that
money
could
add

can

death
which
ends

and
again
he
twisted
the
screw
with
the
stripped
thread
and
again
it
turned
uselessly
in
the
same
place
.
his
servant
handed
him
a
halfcut
novel
in
the
form
of
letters
by
madame
de
souza
.
he
began
reading
about

struggles
of
a

emilie
de

why
did

when
she
ioved
him
he
thought
.
god
could
not
have
put
into
her
heart
an
impulse
that
was
against
his
will
.
my
wife
as
she
once
was
did
not

and
perhaps
she
was
right
.
nothing

discovered
pierre
again
said
to
himself
.
all
we
can
know
is
that
we
know
nothing
.
and
thats
the
height
f
human
wisdom
.
everything
within
and
around
him
seemed
on
fused
senseless
and
repellent
.
yet
in
this
very
repugnance
to
all
his
circumstances
pierre
found
a
kind
of
tantalizing
satisfaction
.
i
make
bold
to
ask
your
excellency
to
move

little
for
this
gentleman
said
the
postmaster
entering
the
room
followed
by
another
travel
er
also
detained
for
lack
of
horses
.
the
newcomer
was
a
short
largeboned
yel
lowfaced
wrinkled
old
man
with
gray
bushy
eyebrows
overhanging
bright
eyes
of
an
indefi
nite
grayish
color
.
pierre
took
his
feet
off
the
table
stood
up
and
lay
down
on
a
bed
that
had
been
got
ready
for
him
glancing
now
and
then
at
the
newcom
er
who
with
a
gloomy
and
tired
face
was
wearily
taking
off
his
wraps
with
the
aid
of
his
servant
and
not
looking
at
pierre
.
with
a
pair
of
felt
boots
on
his
thin
bony
legs
and
keep
ing
on
a
worn
nankeencovered
sheepskin
coat
the
traveler
sat
down
on
the
sofa
leaned
back
his
big
head
with
its
broad
temples
and
closecropped
hair
and
looked
at
beziikhov
.
the
stern
shrewd
and
penetrating
expression
of
that
look
struck
pierre
.
he
felt
a
wish
to
speak
to
the
stranger
but
by
the
time
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
ask
him
a
question
about
the
roads
the
traveler
had
closed
his
eyes
.
his
shriveled
old
hands
were
folded
and
on
the
finger
of
one
of
them
pierre
noticed
a
large
cast
iron
ring
with
a
seal
representing
a
deaths
head
.
the
stranger
sat
without
stirring
either
resting
or
as
it
seemed
to
pierre
sunk
in
pro
found
and
calm
meditation
.
his
servant
was
also
a
yellow
wrinkled
old
man
without
beard
or
mustache
evidently
not
because
he
was
shav
en
but
because
they
had
never
grown
.
this
ac
tive
old
servant
was
unpacking
the
travelers
canteen
and
preparing
tea
.
he
brought
in
a
boiling
samovar
.
when
everything
was
ready
the
stranger
opened
his
eyes
moved
to
the
table
filled
a
tumbler
with
tea
for
himself
and
one
for
the
beardless
old
man
to
whom
he
passed
it
.
pierre
began
to
feel
a
sense
of
un
easiness
and
the
need
even
the
inevitability
of
entering
into
conversation
with
this
stranger
.
the
servant
brought
back
his
tumbler
turned
upside
down
1
with
an
unfinished
bit
of
nib
bled
sugar
and
asked
if
anything
more
would
be
wanted
.
no
.
give
me
the
book
said
the
stranger
.
the
servant
handed
him
a
book
which
pierre
took
to
be
a
devotional
work
and
the
traveler
became
absorbed
in
it
.
pierre
looked
at
him
.
all
at
once
the
stranger
closed
the
book
putting
in
a
marker
and
again
leaning
with
his
arms
on
the
back
of
the
sofa
sat
in
his
former
position
with
his
eyes
shut
.
pierre
looked
at
him
and
had
not
time
to
turn
away
when
the
old
man
opening
his
eyes
fixed
his
steady
and
severe
gaze
straight
on
pierres
face
.
pierre
felt
confused
and
wished
to
avoid
that
look
but
the
bright
old
eyes
attracted
him
ir
resistibly
.
chapter
ii
i
have
the
pleasure
of
addressing
count
be
ziikhov
if
i
am
not
mistaken
said
the
stran
ger
in
a
deliberate
and
loud
voice
.
pierre
looked
silently
and
inquiringly
at
him
over
his
spectacles
.
i
have
heard
of
you
my
dear
sir
continued
the
stranger
and
of
your
misfortune
.
he
seemed
to
emphasize
the
last
word
as
if
to
say
yes
misfortune
call
it
what
you
please
i
know
that
what
happened
to
you
in
moscow
was
a
misfortune
.
i
regret
it
very
much
my
dear
sir
.
pierre
flushed
and
hurriedly
putting
his
legs
down
from
the
bed
bent
forward
toward
the
old
man
with
a
forced
and
timid
smile
.
i
have
not
referred
to
this
out
of
curiosity
my
dear
sir
but
for
greater
reasons
.
he
paused
his
gaze
still
on
pierre
and
moved
aside
on
the
sofa
by
way
of
inviting
the
other
to
take
a
seat
beside
him
.
pierre
felt
reluctant
to
enter
into
conversation
with
this
old
man
but
submitting
to
him
involuntarily
came
up
and
sat
down
beside
him
.
you
are
unhappy
my
dear
sir
the
stranger
continued
.
you
are
young
and
i
am
old
.
i
should
like
to
help
you
as
far
as
lies
in
my
power
.
oh
yes
said
pierre
with
a
forced
smile
.
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
.
where
are
you
trav
eling
from
the
strangers
face
was
not
genial
it
was
even
cold
and
severe
but
in
spite
of
this
both
the
face
and
words
of
his
new
acquaintance
were
irresistibly
attractive
to
pierre
.
but
if
for
any
reason
you
dont
feel
inclined
1
to
indicate
he
did
not
want
more
tea
.
ig6
war
and
peace
to
talk
to
me
said
the
old
man
say
so
my
dear
sir
.
and
he
suddenly
smiled
in
an
un
expected
and
tenderly
paternal
way
oh
no
not
at
all
on
the
contrary
i
am
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
said
pierre
.
and
again
glancing
at
the
strangers
hands
he
looked
more
closely
at
the
ring
with
its
skulla
masonic
sign
.
allow
me
to
ask
he
said
are
you
a
ma
son
yes
i
belong
to
the
brotherhood
of
the
freemasons
said
the
stranger
looking
deep
er
and
deeper
into
pierres
eyes
.
and
in
their
name
and
my
own
i
hold
out
a
brotherly
hand
to
you
.
i
am
afraid
said
pierre
smiling
and
wa
vering
between
the
confidence
the
personality
of
the
freemason
inspired
in
him
and
his
own
habit
of
ridiculing
the
masonic
beliefs
i
am
afraid
i
am
very
far
from
understanding
how
am
i
to
put
it
i
am
afraid
my
way
of
looking
at
the
world
is
soopposed
to
yours
that
we
shall
not
understand
one
another
.
i
knowyour
outlook
said
the
mason
and
the
view
of
life
you
mention
and
which
you
think
is
the
result
of
your
own
mental
efforts
is
the
one
held
by
the
majority
of
people
and
is
the
invariable
fruit
of
pride
indolence
and
ignorance
.
forgive
me
my
dear
sir
but
if
i
had
not
known
it
i
should
not
have
addressed
you
.
your
view
of
life
is
a
regrettable
delusion
.
just
as
i
may
suppose
you
to
be
deluded
said
pierre
with
a
faint
smile
.
i
should
never
dare
to
say
that
i
know
the
truth
said
the
mason
whose
words
struck
pierre
more
and
more
by
their
precision
and
firmness
.
no
one
can
attain
to
truth
by
him
self
.
only
by
laying
stone
on
stone
with
the
co
operation
of
all
by
the
millions
of
generations
from
our
forefather
adam
to
our
own
times
is
that
temple
reared
which
is
to
be
a
worthy
dwelling
place
of
the
great
god
he
added
and
closed
his
eyes
.
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
i
do
not
believe

..
.
do
not
believe
in
god
said
pierre
regret
fully
and
with
an
effort
feeling
it
essential
to
speak
the
whole
truth
.
the
mason
looked
intently
at
pierre
and
smiled
as
a
rich
man
with
millions
in
hand
might
smile
at
a
poor
fellow
who
told
him
that
he
poor
man
had
not
the
five
rubles
that
would
make
him
happy
.
yes
you
do
not
know
him
my
dear
sir
said
the
mason
.
you
cannot
know
him
.
you
do
not
know
him
and
that
is
why
you
are
un
happy
.
yes
yes
i
am
unhappy
assented
pierre
.
but
what
am
i
to
do
you
know
him
not
my
dear
sir
and
so
you
are
very
unhappy
.
you
do
not
know
him
but
he
is
here
he
is
in
me
he
is
in
my
words
he
is
in
theeand
even
in
those
blasphemous
words
thou
hast
just
uttered
pronounced
the
mason
in
a
stern
and
tremulous
voice
.
he
paused
and
sighed
evidently
trying
to
calm
himself
.
if
he
were
not
he
said
quietly
you
and
i
would
not
be
speaking
of
him
my
dear
sir
.
of
what
of
whom
are
we
speaking
whom
hast
thou
denied
he
suddenly
asked
with
ex
ulting
austerity
and
authority
in
his
voice
.
who
invented
him
if
he
did
not
exist
whence
came
thy
conception
of
the
existence
of
such
an
incomprehensible
being
why
didst
thou
and
why
did
the
whole
world
conceive
the
idea
of
the
existence
of
such
an
incompre
hensible
being
a
being
allpowerful
eternal
and
infinite
in
all
his
attributes

.

.

.
he
stopped
and
remained
silent
for
a
long
time
.
pierre
could
not
and
did
not
wish
to
break
this
silence
.
he
exists
but
to
understand
him
is
hard
the
mason
began
again
looking
not
at
pierre
but
straight
before
him
and
turning
the
leaves
of
his
book
with
his
old
hands
which
from
ex
citement
he
could
not
keep
still
.
if
it
were
a
man
whose
existence
thou
didst
doubt
i
could
bring
him
to
thee
could
take
him
by
the
hand
and
show
him
to
thee
.
but
how
can
i
an
insig
nificant
mortal
show
his
omnipotence
his
in
finity
and
all
his
mercy
to
one
who
is
blind
or
who
shuts
his
eyes
that
he
may
not
see
or
understand
him
and
may
not
see
or
under
stand
his
own
vileness
and
sinfulness
he
paused
again
.
who
art
thou
thou
dreamest
that
thou
art
wise
because
thou
couldst
utter
those
blasphemous
words
he
went
on
with
a
somber
and
scornful
smile
.
and
thou
art
more
foolish
and
unreasonable
than
a
little
child
who
playing
with
the
parts
of
a
skillfully
made
watch
dares
to
say
that
as
he
does
not
under
stand
its
use
he
does
not
believe
in
the
master
who
made
it
.
to
know
him
is
hard
.

.

.

.
for
ages
from
our
forefather
adam
to
our
own
day
we
labor
to
attain
that
knowledge
and
are
still
infinitely
far
from
our
aim
but
in
our
lack
of
understanding
we
see
only
our
weak
ness
and
his
greatness
.

.

.

.
pierre
listened
with
swelling
heart
gazing
into
the
masons
face
with
shining
eyes
not
interrupting
or
questioning
him
but
believ
ing
with
his
whole
soul
what
the
stranger
said
.
whether
he
accepted
the
wise
reasoning
con
tained
in
the
masons
words
or
believed
as
a
child
believes
in
the
speakers
tone
of
convic
tion
and
earnestness
or
the
tremor
of
the
speak
ers
voicewhich
sometimes
almost
broke
or
those
brilliant
aged
eyes
grown
old
in
this
con
viction
or
the
calm
firmness
and
certainty
of
his
vocation
which
radiated
from
his
whole
be
ing
and
which
struck
pierre
especially
by
con
trast
with
his
own
dejection
and
hopelessness
at
any
rate
pierre
longed
with
his
whole
soul
to
believe
and
he
did
believe
and
felt
a
joyful
sense
of
comfort
regeneration
and
return
to
life
.
he
is
not
to
be
apprehended
by
reason
but
by
life
said
the
mason
.
i
do
not
understand
said
pierre
feeling
with
dismay
doubts
reawakening
.
he
was
afraid
of
any
want
of
clearness
any
weakness
in
the
masons
arguments
he
dreaded
not
to
be
able
to
believe
in
him
.
i
dont
under
stand
he
said
how
it
is
that
the
mind
of
man
cannot
attain
the
knowledge
of
which
you
speak
.
the
mason
smiled
with
his
gentle
fatherly
smile
.
the
highest
wisdom
and
truth
are
like
the
purest
liquid
we
may
wish
to
imbibe
he
said
.
can
i
receive
that
pure
liquid
into
an
impure
vessel
and
judge
of
its
purity
only
by
the
in
ner
purification
of
myself
can
i
retain
in
some
degree
of
purity
the
liquid
i
receive
.
yes
yes
that
is
so
said
pierre
joyfully
.
the
highest
wisdom
is
not
founded
on
rea
son
alone
not
on
those
worldly
sciences
of
phys
ics
history
chemistry
and
the
like
into
which
intellectual
knowledge
is
divided
.
the
highest
wisdom
is
one
.
the
highest
wisdom
has
but
one
science
the
science
of
the
whole
the
sci
ence
explaining
the
whole
creation
and
mans
place
in
it
.
to
receive
that
science
it
is
neces
sary
to
purify
and
renew
ones
inner
self
and
so
before
one
can
know
it
is
necessary
to
be
lieve
and
to
perfect
ones
self
.
and
to
attain
this
end
we
have
the
light
called
conscience
that
god
has
implanted
in
our
souls
.
yes
yes
assented
pierre
.
look
then
at
thy
inner
self
with
the
eyes
of
the
spirit
and
ask
thyself
whether
thou
art
con
tent
with
thyself
.
what
hast
thou
attained

only
what

then
change

thy
self
and
as
thou
art
purified
thou
wilt
gain

look
at
your
life
my
dear

.
how
have
you
spent
it
in
riotous
orgies
and
de

everything

what
have
you
done
you
have
not
helped
her
to
find
the
way
of
truth
my
dear
sir
but
have
thrust
her
into
an
abyss
of
de
ceit
and
misery
.
a
man
offended
you
and
you
shot
him
and
you
say
you
do
not
know
god
and
hate
your
life
.
there
is
nothing
strange
in
that
my
dear
sir
after
these
words
the
mason
as
if
tired
by
his
long
discourse
again
leaned
his
arms
on
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
closed
his
eyes
.
pierre
looked
at
that
aged
stern
motionless
almost
lifeless
face
and
moved
his
lips
without
utter
ing
a
sound
.
he
wished
to
say
yes
a
vile
idle
vicious
life
but
dared
not
break
the
silence
.
the
mason
cleared
his
throat
huskily
as
old
men
do
and
called
his
servant
.
how
about
the
horses
he
asked
without
looking
at
pierre
.
the
exchange
horses
have
just
come
an
swered
the
servant
.
will
you
not
rest
here
no
tell
them
to
harness
.
can
he
really
be
going
away
and
leaving
me
alone
without
having
told
me
all
and
without
promising
to
help
me
thought
pierre
rising
with
downcast
head
and
he
began
to
pace
the
room
glancing
occasionally
at
the
mason
.
yes
i
never
thought
of
it
but
i
have
led
a
con
temptible
and
profligate
life
though
i
did
not
like
it
and
did
not
want
to
thought
pierre
.
but
this
man
knows
the
truth
and
if
he
wished
to
could
disclose
it
to
me
.
pierre
wished
to
say
this
to
the
mason
but
did
not
dare
to
.
the
traveler
having
packed
his
things
with
his
practiced
hands
began
fas
tening
his
coat
.
when
he
had
finished
he
turned
to
bezukhov
and
said
in
a
tone
of
indifferent
politeness

are

my
dear
sir

.

.
im
going
to
petersburg
answered
pierre
in
a
childlike
hesitating
voice
.
i
thank
you
.
i
agree
with
all
you
have
said
.
but
do
not
suppose
me
to
be
so
bad
.
with
my
whole
soul
i
wish
to
be
what
you
would
have
me
be
but
i
have
never
had
help
from
anyone
.

.

.

.
but
it
is
i
above
all
who
am
to
blame
for
everything
.
help
me
teach
me
and
perhaps
i
may

.

.

.
pierre
could
not
go
on
.
he
gulped
and
turn
ed
away
.
the
mason
remained
silent
for
a
long
time
evidently
considering
.
help
comes
from
god
alone
he
said
but
such
measure
of
help
as
our
order
can
bestow
it
will
render
you
my
dear
sir
.
you
are
going
to

hand
this
to
count
willarski
he
took
out
his
notebook
and
wrote
a
few
words
on
a
large
sheet
of
paper
folded
in
four
.
al
low
me
to
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
.
when
you
reach
the
capital
first
of
all
devote
some
time
to
solitude
and
selfexamination
and
do
not
resume
your
former
way
of
life
.
and
now
i
wish
you
a
good
journey
my
dear
sir
he
add
ed
seeing
that
his
servant
had
entered

.

.
and
success
.
the
traveler
was
joseph
alextfevich
bazd
ev
as
pierre
saw
from
the
postmasters
book
.
bazdeev
had
been
one
of
the
bestknown
free
masons
and
martinistseven
in
novfkovs
time
.
for
a
long
while
after
he
had
gone
pierre
did
not
go
to
bed
or
order
horses
but
paced
up
and
down
the
room
pondering
over
his
vicious
past
and
with
a
rapturous
sense
of
beginning
anew
pictured
to
himself
the
blissful
irre
proachable
virtuous
future
that
seemed
to
him
so
easy
.
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
vi
cious
only
because
he
had
somehow
forgotten
how
good
it
is
to
be
virtuous
.
not
a
trace
of
his
former
doubts
remained
in
his
soul
.
he
firmly
believed
in
the
possibility
of
the
brotherhood
of
men
united
in
the
aim
of
supporting
one
an
other
in
the
path
of
virtue
and
that
is
how
freemasonry
presented
itself
to
him
.
chapter
iii
on
reaching
petersburg
pierre
did
not
let
anyone
know
of
his
arrival
he
went
nowhere
and
spent
whole
days
in
reading
thomas
a
kempis
whose
book
had
been
sent
him
by
someone
unknown
.
one
thing
he
continually
realized
as
he
read
that
book
the
joy
hitherto
unknown
to
him
of
believing
in
the
possibil
ity
of
attaining
perfection
and
in
the
possibil
ity
of
active
brotherly
love
among
men
which
joseph
alexevich
had
revealed
to
him
.
a
week
after
his
arrival
the
young
polish
count
willarski
whom
pierre
had
known
slightly
in
petersburg
society
came
into
his
room
one
eve
ning
in
the
official
and
ceremonious
manner
in
which
d61okhovs
second
had
called
on
him
and
having
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
nobody
else
in
the
room
addressed
pierre
.
i
have
come
to
you
with
a
message
and
an
offer
count
he
said
without
sitting
down
.
a
person
of
very
high
standing
in
our
brother
hood
has
made
application
for
you
to
be
re
ceived
into
our
order
before
the
usual
term
and
has
proposed
to
me
to
be
your
sponsor
.
i
consider
it
a
sacred
duty
to
fulfill
that
persons
wishes
.
do
you
wish
to
enter
the
brotherhood
of
freemasons
under
my
sponsorship
the
cold
austere
tone
of
this
man
whom
he
had
almost
always
before
met
at
balls
amiably
smiling
in
the
society
of
the
most
brilliant
women
surprised
pierre
.
yes
i
do
wish
it
said
he
.
willarski
bowed
his
head
.
onemore
question
count
hesaid
which
i
beg
you
to
answer
in
all
sincerity
not
as
a
future
mason
but
as
an
honest
man
have
you
renounced
your
former
convictions
do
you
be
lieve
in
god
pierre
considered
.
yes

.

.

.
yes
i
believe
in
god
he
said
.
in
that
case

.

.

.
began
willarski
but
pierre
interrupted
him
.
yes
i
do
believe
in
god
he
repeated
.
in
that
case
we
can
go
said
willarski
.
my
carriage
is
at
your
service
.
willarski
was
silent
throughout
the
drive
.
to
pierres
inquiries
as
to
what
he
must
do
and
how
he
should
answer
willarski
only
replied
that
brothers
more
worthy
than
he
would
test
him
and
that
pierre
had
only
to
tell
the
truth
.
having
entered
the
courtyard
of
a
large
house
where
the
lodge
had
its
headquarters
and
having
ascended
a
dark
staircase
they
en
tered
a
small
welllit
anteroom
where
they
took
off
their
cloaks
without
the
aid
of
a
servant
.
from
there
they
passed
into
another
room
.
a
man
in
strange
attire
appeared
at
the
door
.
willarski
stepping
toward
him
said
some
thing
to
him
in
french
in
an
undertone
and
then
went
up
to
a
small
wardrobe
in
which
pierre
noticed
garments
such
as
he
had
never
seen
before
.
having
taken
a
kerchief
from
the
cupboard
willarski
bound
pierres
eyes
with
it
and
tied
it
in
a
knot
behind
catching
some
hairs
painfully
in
the
knot
.
then
he
drew
his
face
down
kissed
him
and
taking
him
by
the
book
five
199
hand
led
him
forward
.
the
hairs
tied
in
the
knot
hurt
pierre
and
there
were
lines
of
pain
on
his
face
and
a
shamefaced
smile
.
his
huge
figure
with
arms
hanging
down
and
with
a
puckered
though
smiling
face
moved
after
willarski
with
uncertain
timid
steps
.
having
led
him
about
ten
paces
willarski
stopped
.
whatever
happens
to
you
he
said
you
must
bear
it
all
manfully
if
you
have
firmly
re
solved
to
join
our
brotherhood
.
pierre
nod
ded
affirmatively
.
when
you
hear
a
knock
at
the
door
you
will
uncover
your
eyes
added
willarski
.
i
wish
you
courage
and
success
and
pressing
pierres
hand
he
went
out
.
left
alone
pierre
went
on
smiling
in
the
same
way
.
once
or
twice
he
shrugged
his
shoul
ders
and
raised
his
hand
to
the
kerchief
as
if
wishing
to
take
it
off
but
let
it
drop
again
.
the
five
minutes
spent
with
his
eyes
bandaged
seemed
to
him
an
hour
.
his
arms
felt
numb
his
legs
almost
gave
way
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
tired
out
.
he
experienced
a
variety
of
most
complex
sensations
.
he
felt
afraid
of
what
would
happen
to
him
and
still
more
afraid
of
showing
his
fear
.
he
felt
curious
to
know
what
was
going
to
happen
and
what
would
be
revealed
to
him
but
most
of
all
he
felt
joyful
that
the
moment
had
come
when
he
would
at
last
start
on
that
path
of
regeneration
and
on
the
actively
virtuous
life
of
which
he
had
been
dreaming
since
he
met
joseph
alex
evich
.
loud
knocks
were
heard
at
the
door
.
pi
erre
took
the
bandage
off
his
eyes
and
glanced
around
him
.
the
room
was
in
black
darkness
only
a
small
lamp
was
burning
inside
some
thing
white
.
pierre
went
nearer
and
saw
that
the
lamp
stood
on
a
black
table
on
which
lay
an
open
book
.
the
book
was
the
gospel
and
the
white
thing
with
the
lamp
inside
was
a
hu
man
skull
with
its
cavities
and
teeth
.
after
reading
the
first
words
of
the
gospel
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
pierre
went
round
the
table
and
saw
a
large
open
box
filled
with
something
.
it
was
a
coffin
with
bones
inside
.
he
was
not
at
all
surprised
by
what
he
saw
.
hoping
to
enter
on
an
entirely
new
life
quite
unlike
the
old
one
he
expected
everything
to
be
unusual
even
more
unusual
than
what
he
was
seeing
.
a
skull
a
coffin
the
gospel
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
expected
all
this
and
even
more
.
trying
to
stimulate
his
emotions
he
looked
around
.
god
death
love
the
brotherhood
of
man
he
kept
saying
to
himself
associat
ing
these
words
with
vague
yet
joyful
ideas
.
the
door
opened
and
someone
came
in
.
by
the
dim
light
to
which
pierre
had
already
become
accustomed
he
saw
a
rather
short
man
.
having
evidently
come
from
the
light
into
the
darkness
the
man
paused
then
moved
with
cautious
steps
toward
the
table
and
placed
on
it
his
small
leathergloved
hands
.
this
short
man
had
on
a
white
leather
apron
which
covered
his
chest
and
part
of
his
legs
he
had
on
a
kind
of
necklace
above
which
rose
a
high
white
ruffle
outlining
his
rather
long
face
which
was
lit
up
from
below
.
for
what
have
you
come
hither
asked
the
newcomer
turning
in
pierres
direction
at
a
slight
rustle
made
by
the
latter
.
why
have
you
who
do
not
believe
in
the
truth
of
the
light
and
who
have
not
seen
the
light
come
here
what
do
you
seek
from
us
wisdom
virtue
en
lightenment
at
the
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
stranger
came
in
pierre
felt
a
sense
of
awe
and
veneration
such
as
he
had
experienced
in
his
boyhood
at
confession
he
felt
himself
in
the
presence
of
one
socially
a
complete
stranger
yet
nearer
to
him
through
the
brotherhood
of
man
.
with
bated
breath
and
beating
heart
he
moved
toward
the
rhetor
by
which
name
the
brother
who
prepared
a
seeker
for
entrance
in
to
the
brotherhood
was
known
.
drawing
near
er
he
recognized
in
the
rhetor
a
man
he
knew
smolyaninov
and
it
mortified
him
to
think
that
the
newcomer
was
an
acquaintance
he
wished
him
simply
a
brother
and
a
virtuous
in
structor
.
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
utter
a
word
so
that
the
rhetor
had
to
repeat
his
ques
tion
.
yes

..
.
i

..
.
i

..
.
desire
regeneration
pierre
uttered
with
difficulty
.
very
well
said
smolyaninov
and
went
on
at
once
have
you
any
idea
of
the
means
by
which
our
holy
order
will
help
you
to
reach
your
aim
said
he
quietly
and
quickly
.
i

..
.
hope

..
.
for
guidance

.

.

.
help

..
.
in
regeneration
said
pierre
with
a
trembling
voice
and
some
difficulty
in
utterance
due
to
his
excitement
and
to
being
unaccustomed
to
speak
of
abstract
matters
in
russian
.
what
is
your
conception
of
freemasonry
i
imagine
that
freemasonry
is
the
fraternity
and
equality
of
men
who
have
virtuous
aims
said
pierre
feeling
ashamed
of
the
inadequacy
of
his
words
for
the
solemnity
of
the
moment
as
he
spoke
.
i
imagine


.

.
good
said
the
rhetor
quickly
apparent
ly
satisfied
with
this
answer
.
have
you
sought
for
means
of
attaining
your
aim
in
religion
2oo
no
i
considered
it
erroneous
and
did
not
follow
it
said
pierre
so
softly
that
the
rhetor
did
not
hear
him
and
asked
him
what
he
was
saying
.
i
have
been
an
atheist
answered
pierre
.
you
are
seeking
for
truth
in
order
to
follow
its
laws
in
your
life
therefore
you
seek
wisdom
and
virtue
.
is
that
not
so
said
the
rhetor
after
a
moments
pause
.
yes
yes
assented
pierre
.
the
rhetor
cleared
his
throat
crossed
his
gloved
hands
on
his
breast
and
began
to
speak
.
now
i
must
disclose
to
you
the
chief
aim
of
our
order
he
said
and
if
this
aim
coincides
with
yours
you
may
enter
our
brotherhood
with
profit
.
the
first
and
chief
object
of
our
order
the
foundation
on
which
it
rests
and
which
no
human
power
can
destroy
is
the
pres
ervation
and
handing
on
to
posterity
of
a
cer
tain
important
mystery

.

.

.
which
has
come
down
to
us
from
the
remotest
ages
even
from
the
first
man
a
mystery
on
which
perhaps
the
fate
of
mankind
depends
.
but
since
this
mys
tery
is
of
such
a
nature
that
nobody
can
know
or
use
it
unless
he
be
prepared
by
long
and
dil
igent
selfpurification
not
everyone
can
hope
to
attain
itquickly
.
hencewe
have
a
secondary
aim
that
of
preparing
our
members
as
much
as
possible
to
reform
their
hearts
to
purify
and
enlighten
their
minds
by
means
handed
on
to
us
by
tradition
from
those
who
have
striven
to
attain
this
mystery
and
thereby
to
render
them
capable
of
receiving
it
.
by
purifyingand
regeneratingour
members
we
try
thirdly
to
improve
the
whole
human
race
offering
it
in
our
members
an
example
of
piety
and
virtue
and
thereby
try
with
all
our
might
to
combat
theevil
which
sways
the
world
.
think
this
over
and
i
will
come
to
you
again
.
to
combat
the
evil
which
sways
the
world

.

.

.
pierre
repeated
and
a
mental
image
of
his
future
activity
in
this
direction
rose
in
his
mind
.
he
imagined
men
such
as
he
had
himself
been
a
fortnight
ago
and
he
addressed
an
edify
ing
exhortation
to
them
.
he
imagined
to
him
self
vicious
and
unfortunate
people
whom
he
would
assist
by
word
and
deed
imagined
op
pressors
whose
victims
he
would
rescue
.
of
the
three
objects
mentioned
by
the
rhetor
this
last
that
of
improving
mankind
especially
ap
pealed
to
pierre
.
the
important
mystery
men
tioned
by
the
rhetor
though
it
aroused
his
cu
riosity
did
not
seem
to
him
essential
and
the
second
aim
that
of
purifying
and
regenerating
himself
did
not
much
interest
him
because
at
that
moment
he
felt
with
delight
that
he
was
war
and
peace
already
perfectly
cured
of
his
former
faults
and
was
ready
for
all
that
was
good
.
half
an
hour
later
the
rhetor
returned
to
inform
the
seeker
of
the
seven
virtues
corre
sponding
to
the
seven
steps
of

in
the
seventh
place
try
by
the
frequent
thought
of
death
the
rhetor
said
to
bring
yourself
to
regard
it
not
as
a
dreaded
foe
but
as
a
friend
that
frees
the
soul
grown
weary
in
the
labors
of
virtue
from
this
distressful
life
and
leads
it
to
its
place
of
recompense
and
peace
.
yes
that
must
be
so
thought
pierre
when
after
these
words
the
rhetor
went
away
leav
ing
him
to
solitary
meditation
.
it
must
be
so
but
i
am
still
so
weak
that
i
love
my
life
the
meaning
of
which
is
only
now
gradually
open
ing
before
me
.
but
five
of
the
other
virtues
which
pierre
recalled
counting
them
on
his
fingers
he
felt
already
in
his
soul
courage
generosity
morality
love
of
mankind
and
es
pecially
obedience
which
did
not
even
seem
to
him
a
virtue
but
a
joy
.
he
now
felt
so
glad
to
be
free
from
his
own
lawlessness
and
to
sub
mit
his
will
to
those
who
knew
the
indubitable
truth
.
he
forgot
what
the
seventh
virtue
was
and
could
not
recall
it
.
the
third
time
the
rhetor
came
back
more
quickly
and
asked
pierre
whether
he
was
still
firm
in
his
intention
and
determined
to
sub
mit
to
all
that
would
be
required
of
him
.
i
am
ready
for
everything
said
pierre
.
i
must
also
inform
you
said
the
rhetor
that
our
order
delivers
its
teaching
not
in
words
only
but
also
by
other
means
which
may
perhaps
have
a
stronger
effect
on
the
sincere
seeker
after
wisdom
and
virtue
than
mere
words
.
this
chamberwith
what
yousee
therein
should
already
have
suggested
to
your
heart
if
it
is
sincere
more
than
words
could
do
.
you
will
perhaps
also
see
in
your
further
initiation
a
like
method
of
enlightenment
.
our
order
imitates
the
ancient
societies
that
explained
their
teaching
by
hieroglyphics
.
a
hieroglyph
said
the
rhetor
is
an
emblem
of
something
not
cognizable
by
the
senses
but
which
possess
es
qualities
resembling
those
of
the
symbol
.
pierre
knew
very
well
what
a
hieroglyph
was
but
dared
not
speak
.
he
listened
to
the
rhetor
in
silence
feeling
from
all
he
said
that
book
five
his
ordeal
was
about
to
begin
.
if
you
are
resolved
i
must
begin
your
ini
tiation

said
the
rhetor
coming
closer
to
pierre
.
in
token
of
generosity
i
ask
you
to
give
me
all
your
valuables
.
but
i
have
nothing
here
replied
pierre
supposing
that
he
was
asked
to
give
up
all
he
possessed
.
what
you
have
with
you
watch
money
rings
.

.

.

.
pierre
quickly
took
out
his
purse
and
watch
but
could
not
manage
for
some
time
to
get
the
wedding
ring
off
his
fat
finger
.
when
that
had
been
done
the
rhetor
said
in
token
of
obedience
i
ask
you
to
undress
.
pierre
took
off
his
coat
waistcoat
and
left
boot
according
to
the
rhetors
instructions
.
the
mason
drew
the
shirt
back
from
pierres
left
breast
and
stooping
down
pulled
up
the
left
leg
of
his
trousers
to
above
the
knee
.
pierre
hurriedly
began
taking
off
his
right
boot
also
and
was
going
to
tuck
up
the
other
trouser
leg
to
save
this
stranger
the
trouble
but
the
mason
told
him
that
was
not
neces
sary
and
gave
him
a
slipper
for
his
left
foot
.
with
a
childlike
smile
of
embarrassment
doubt
and
selfderision
which
appeared
on
his
face
against
his
will
pierre
stood
with
his
arms
hanging
down
and
legs
apart
before
his
brother
rhetor
and
awaited
his
further
commands
.
and
now
in
token
of
candor
i
ask
you
to
reveal
to
me
your
chief
passion
said
the
lat
ter
.
my
passion
i
have
had
so
many
replied
pierre
.
that
passion
which
more
than
all
others
caused
you
to
waver
on
the
path
of
virtue
said
the
mason
.
pierre
paused
seeking
a
reply
.
wine
gluttony
idleness
laziness
irri
tability
anger
women
he
went
over
his
vices
in
his
mind
not
knowing
to
which
of
them
to
give
the
preeminence
.
women
he
said
in
a
low
scarcely
audible
voice
.
the
mason
did
not
move
and
for
a
long
time
said
nothing
after
this
answer
.
at
last
he
moved
up
to
pierre
and
taking
the
kerchief
that
lay
on
the
table
again
bound
his
eyes
.
for
the
last
time
i
say
to
you
turn
all
your
attention
upon
yourself
put
a
bridle
on
your
senses
and
seek
blessedness
not
in
passion
but
in
your
own
heart
.
the
source
of
blessedness
is
not
without
us
but
within
.

.

.

.
pierre
had
already
long
been
feeling
in
him
201
self
that
refreshing
source
of
blessedness
which
now
flooded
his
heart
with
glad
emotion
.
chapter
iv
soon
after
this
there
came
into
the
dark
cham
ber
to
fetch
pierre
not
the
rhetor
but
pierres
sponsor
willarski
whom
he
recognized
by
his
voice
.
to
fresh
questions
as
to
the
firmness
of
his
resolution
pierre
replied
yes
yes
i
agree
and
with
a
beaming
childlike
smile
his
fat
chest
uncovered
stepping
unevenly
and
timid
ly
in
one
slippered
and
one
booted
foot
he
ad
vanced
while
willarski
held
a
sword
to
his
bare
chest
.
he
was
conducted
from
that
room
along
passages
that
turned
backwards
and
for
wards
and
was
at
last
brought
to
the
doors
of
the
lodge
.
willarski
coughed
he
was
answered
by
the
masonic
knock
with
mallets
the
doors
opened
before
them
.
a
bass
voice
pierre
was
still
blindfold
questioned
him
as
to
who
he
was
when
and
where
he
was
born
and
so
on
.
then
he
was
again
led
somewhere
still
blind
fold
and
as
they
went
along
he
was
told
alle
gories
of
the
toils
of
his
pilgrimage
of
holy
friendship
of
the
eternal
architect
of
the
uni
verse
and
of
the
courage
with
which
he
should
endure
toils
and
dangers
.
during
these
wander
ings
pierre
noticed
that
he
was
spoken
of
now
as
the
seeker
now
as
the
sufferer
and
now
as
the
postulant
to
the
accompaniment
of
various
knockings
with
mallets
and
swords
.
as
he
was
being
led
up
to
some
object
he
noticed
a
hesitation
and
uncertainty
among
his
con
ductors
.
he
heard
those
around
him
disput
ing
in
whispers
and
one
of
them
insisting
that
he
should
be
led
along
a
certain
carpet
.
after
that
they
took
his
right
hand
placed
it
on
something
and
told
him
to
hold
a
pair
of
com
passes
to
his
left
breast
with
the
other
hand
and
to
repeat
after
someone
who
read
aloud
an
oath
of
fidelity
to
the
laws
of
the
order
.
the
candles
were
then
extinguished
and
some
spirit
lighted
as
pierre
knew
by
the
smell
and
he
was
told
that
he
would
now
see
the
lesser
light
.
the
bandage
was
taken
off
his
eyes
and
by
the
faint
light
of
the
burning
spirit
pierre
as
in
a
dream
saw
several
men
standing
before
him
wearing
aprons
like
the
rhetors
and
holding
swords
in
their
hands
pointed
at
his
breast
.
among
them
stood
a
man
whose
white
shirt
was
stained
with
blood
.
on
seeing
this
pierre
moved
forward
with
his
breast
toward
the
swords
meaning
them
to
pierce
it
.
but
the
swords
were
drawn
back
from
him
and
he
was
at
once
blindfold
ed
again
.
now
thou
hast
seen
the
lesser
light
ut
202
tered
a
voice
.
then
the
candles
were
relit
and
he
was
told
that
he
would
see
the
full
light
the
bandage
was
again
removed
and
more
than
ten
voices
said
together
sic
transit
gloria
mun
di
.
pierre
gradually
began
to
recover
himself
and
looked
about
at
the
room
and
at
the
peo
ple
in
it
.
round
a
long
table
covered
with
black
sat
some
twelve
men
in
garments
like
those
he
had
already
seen
.
some
of
them
pierre
had
met
in
petersburg
society
.
in
the
presidents
chair
sat
a
young
man
he
did
not
know
with
a
peculiar
cross
hanging
from
his
neck
.
on
his
right
sat
the
italian
abb
whom
pierre
had
met
at
anna
pavlovnas
two
years
before
.
there
were
also
present
a
very
distin
guished
dignitary
and
a
swiss
who
had
former
ly
been
tutor
at
the
kuragins
.
all
maintained
a
solemn
silence
listening
to
the
words
of
the
president
who
held
a
mallet
in
his
hand
.
let
into
the
wall
was
a
starshaped
light
.
at
one
side
of
the
table
was
a
small
carpet
with
var
ious
figures
worked
upon
it
at
the
other
was
something
resembling
an
altar
on
which
lay
a
testament
and
a
skull
.
round
it
stood
seven
large
candlesticks
like
those
used
in
churches
.
two
of
the
brothers
led
pierre
up
to
the
altar
placed
his
feet
at
right
angles
and
bade
him
lie
down
saying
that
he
must
prostrate
himself
at
the
gates
of
the
temple
.
he
must
first
receive
the
trowel
whispered
one
of
the
brothers
.
oh
hush
please
said
another
.
pierre
perplexed
looked
round
with
his
shortsighted
eyes
without
obeying
and
sud
denly
doubts
arose
in
his
mind
.
where
am
i
what
am
i
doing
arent
they
laughing
at
me
shant
i
be
ashamed
to
remember
this
but
these
doubts
only
lasted
a
moment
.
pierre
glanced
at
the
serious
faces
of
those
around
re
membered
all
he
had
already
gone
through
and
realized
that
he
could
not
stop
halfway
.
he
was
aghast
at
his
hesitation
and
trying
to
arouse
his
former
devotional
feeling
prostrat
ed
himself
before
the
gates
of
the
temple
.
and
really
the
feeling
of
devotion
returned
to
him
even
more
strongly
than
before
.
when
he
had
lain
there
some
time
he
was
told
to
get
up
and
a
white
leather
apron
such
as
the
others
wore
was
put
on
him
he
was
given
a
trowel
and
three
pairs
of
gloves
and
then
the
grand
master
addressed
him
.
he
told
him
that
he
should
try
to
do
nothing
to
stain
the
whiteness
of
that
apron
which
symbolized
strength
and
purity
then
of
the
unexplained
trowel
he
told
him
to
toil
with
it
to
cleanse
his
own
heart
war
and
peace
from
vice
and
indulgently
to
smooth
with
it
the
heart
of
his
neighbor
.
as
to
the
first
pair
of
gloves
a
mans
he
said
that
pierre
could
not
know
their
meaning
but
must
keep
them
.
the
second
pair
of
mans
gloves
he
was
to
wear
at
the
meetings
and
finally
of
the
third
a
pair
of
womens
gloves
he
said
dear
brother
these
womans
gloves
are
intended
for
you
too
.
give
them
to
the
woman
whom
you
shall
honor
most
of
all
.
this
gift
will
be
a
pledge
of
your
purity
of
heart
to
her
whom
you
select
to
be
your
worthy
helpmeet
in
masonry
.
and
after
a
pause
he
added
but
beware
dear
brother
that
these
gloves
do
not
deck
hands
that
are
unclean
.
while
the
grand
master
said
these
last
words
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
he
grew
em
barrassed
.
pierre
himself
grew
still
more
con
fused
blushed
like
a
child
till
tears
came
to
his
eyes
began
looking
about
him
uneasily
and
an
awkward
pause
followed
.
this
silence
was
broken
by
one
of
the
breth
ren
who
led
pierre
up
to
the
rug
and
began
reading
to
him
from
a
manuscript
book
an
ex
planation
of
all
the
figures
on
it
the
sun
the
moon
a
hammer
a
plumb
line
a
trowel
a
rough
stone
and
a
squared
stone
a
pillar
three
windows
and
so
on
.
then
a
place
was
assigned
to
pierre
he
was
shown
the
signs
of
the
lodge
told
the
password
and
at
last
was
permitted
to
sit
down
.
the
grand
master
began
reading
the
statutes
.
they
were
very
long
and
pierre
from
joy
agitation
and
embarrassment
was
not
in
a
state
to
understand
what
was
being
read
.
he
managed
to
follow
only
the
last
words
of
the
statutes
and
these
remained
in
his
mind
.
in
our
temples
we
recognize
no
other
dis
tinctions
read
the
grand
master
but
those
between
virtue
and
vice
.
beware
of
making
any
distinctions
which
may
infringe
equality
.
fly
to
a
brothers
aid
whoever
he
may
be
exhort
him
who
goeth
astray
raise
him
that
falleth
never
bear
malice
or
enmity
toward
thy
broth
er
.
be
kindly
and
courteous
.
kindle
in
all
hearts
the
flame
of
virtue
.
share
thy
happiness
with
thy
neighbor
and
may
envy
never
dim
the
purity
of
that
bliss
.
forgive
thy
enemy
do
not
avenge
thyself
except
by
doing
him
good
.
thus
fulfilling
the
highest
law
thou
shalt
regain
traces
of
the
ancient
dignity
which
thou
hast
lost
.
he
finished
and
getting
up
embraced
and
kissed
pierre
who
with
tears
of
joy
in
his
eyes
looked
round
him
not
knowing
how
to
answer
the
congratulations
and
greetings
from
ac
quaintances
that
met
him
on
all
sides
.
he
ac
knowledged
no
acquaintances
but
saw
in
all
book
five
203
these
men
only
brothers
and
burned
with
im
patience
to
set
to
work
with
them
.
the
grand
master
rapped
with
his
mallet
.
all
the
masons
sat
down
in
their
places
and
one
of
them
read
an
exhortation
on
the
neces
sity
of
humility
.
the
grand
master
proposed
that
the
last
du
ty
should
be
performed
and
the
distinguished
dignitary
who
bore
the
title
of
collector
of
alms
went
round
to
all
the
brothers
.
pierre
would
have
liked
to
subscribe
all
he
had
but
fearing
that
it
might
look
like
pride
subscribed
the
same
amount
as
the
others
.
the
meeting
was
at
an
end
and
on
reaching
home
pierre
felt
as
if
he
had
returned
from
a
long
journey
on
which
he
had
spent
dozens
of
years
had
become
completely
changed
and
had
quite
left
behind
his
former
habits
and
way
of
life
.
chapterv
the
day
after
he
had
been
received
into
the
lodge
pierre
was
sitting
at
home
reading
a
book
and
trying
to
fathom
the
significance
of
the
square
one
side
of
which
symbolized
god
another
moral
things
a
third
physical
things
and
the
fourth
a
combination
of
these
.
now
and
then
his
attention
wandered
from
the
book
and
the
square
and
he
formed
in
imagination
a
new
plan
of
life
.
on
the
previous
evening
at
the
lodge
he
had
heard
that
a
rumor
of
his
duel
had
reached
the
emperor
and
that
it
would
be
wiser
for
him
to
leave
petersburg
.
pierre
proposed
going
to
his
estates
in
the
south
and
there
attending
to
the
welfare
of
his
serfs
.
he
was
joyfully
planning
this
new
life
when
prince
vasili
suddenly
entered
the
room
.
my
dear
fellow
what
have
you
been
up
to
in
moscow
why
have
you
quarreled
with
hlne
mon
cherf
you
are
under
a
delusion
said
prince
vasili
as
he
entered
.
i
know
all
about
it
and
i
can
tell
you
positively
that
he
lene
is
as
innocent
before
you
as
christ
was
be
fore
the
jews
.
pierre
was
about
to
reply
but
prince
vasili
interrupted
him
.
and
why
didnt
you
simply
come
straight
to
me
as
to
a
friend
i
know
all
about
it
and
un
derstand
it
all
he
said
.
you
behaved
as
be
comes
a
man
who
values
his
honor
perhaps
too
hastily
but
we
wont
go
into

consid
er
the
position
in
which
you
are
placing
her
and
me
in
the
eyes
of
society
and
even
of
the
court
he
added
lowering
his
voice
.
she
is
living
in
moscow
and
you
are
here
.
remember
dear
boy
and
he
drew
pierres
arm
down
wards
it
is
simply
a
misunderstanding
.
i

you
feel
it
so
yourself
.
let
us
write
her
a
letter
at
once
and
shell
come
here
and
all
will
be
explained
or
else
my
dear
boy
let
me
tell
you
its
quite
likely
youll
have
to
suffer
for
it
.
prince
vasili
gave
pierre
a
significant
look
.
i
know
from
reliable
sources
that
the
dow
ager
empress
is
taking
a
keen
interest
in
the
whole
affair
.
you
know
she
is
very
gracious
to
pierre
tried
several
times
to
speak
but
on
one
hand
prince
vasfli
did
not
let
him
and
on
the
other
pierre
himself
feared
to
begin
to
speak
in
the
tone
of
decided
refusal
and
dis
agreement
in
which
he
had
firmly
resolved
to
answer
his
fatherinlaw
.
moreover
the
words
of
the
masonic
statutes
be
kindly
and
courte
ous
recurred
to
him
.
he
blinked
went
red
got
up
and
sat
down
again
struggling
with
himself
to
do
what
was
for
him
the
most
diffi
cult
thing
in
lifeto
say
an
unpleasant
thing
to
a
mans
face
to
say
what
the
other
whoever
he
might
be
did
not
expect
.
he
was
so
used
to
submitting
to
prince
vasilis
tone
of
careless
selfassurance
that
he
felt
he
would
be
unable
to
withstand
it
now
but
he
also
felt
that
on
what
he
said
now
his
future
depended
wheth
er
he
would
follow
the
same
old
road
or
that
new
path
so
attractively
shown
him
by
the
ma
sons
on
which
he
firmly
believed
he
would
be
reborn
to
a
new
life
.
now
dear
boy
said
prince
vasili
playful
ly
say
yes
and
ill
write
to
her
myself
and
we
will
kill
the
fatted
calf
.
but
before
prince
vasili
had
finished
his
playful
speech
pierre
without
looking
at
him
and
with
a
kind
of
fury
that
made
him
like
his
father
muttered
in
a
whisper
prince
i
did
not
ask
you
here
.
go
please
gol
and
he
jumped
up
and
opened
the
door
for
him
.
gol
he
repeated
amazed
at
himself
and
glad
to
see
the
look
of
confusion
and
fear
that
showed
itself
on
prince
vasilis
face
.
whats
the
matter
with
you
are
you
ill
gol
the
quivering
voice
repeated
.
and
prince
vasili
had
to
go
without
receiving
any
explanation
.
a
week
later
pierre
having
taken
leave
of
his
new
friends
the
masons
and
leaving
large
sums
of
money
with
them
for
alms
went
away
to
his
estates
.
his
new
brethren
gave
him
let
ters
to
the
kiev
and
odessa
masons
and
prom
ised
to
write
to
him
and
guide
him
in
his
new
activity
.
204
war
and
peace
chapter
vi
the
duel
between
pierre
and
d61okhov
was
hushed
up
and
in
spite
of
the
emperors
se
verity
regarding
duels
at
that
time
neither
the
principals
nor
their
seconds
suffered
for
it
.
but
the
story
of
the
duel
confirmed
by
pierres
rupture
with
his
wife
was
the
talk
of
society
.
pierre
who
had
been
regarded
with
patroniz
ing
condescension
when
he
was
an
illegitimate
son
and
petted
and
extolled
when
he
was
the
best
match
in
russia
had
sunk
greatly
in
the
esteem
of
society
after
his
marriage
when
the
marriageable
daughters
and
their
mothers
had
nothing
to
hope
from
himespecially
as
he
did
not
know
how
and
did
not
wish
to
court
so
cietys
favor
.
now
he
alone
was
blamed
for
what
had
happened
he
was
said
to
be
insanely
jealous
and
subject
like
his
father
to
fits
of
bloodthirsty
rage
.
and
when
after
pierres
de
parture
hlene
returned
to
petersburg
she
was
received
by
all
her
acquaintances
not
only
cordially
but
even
with
a
shade
of
deference
due
to
her
misfortune
.
when
conversation
turned
on
her
husband
hlene
assumed
a
dig
nified
expression
which
with
characteristic
tact
she
had
acquired
though
she
did
not
un
derstand
its
significance
.
this
expression
sug
gested
that
she
had
resolved
to
endure
her
troubles
uncomplainingly
and
that
her
hus
band
was
a
cross
laid
upon
her
by
god
.
prince
vasfli
expressed
his
opinion
more
openly
.
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
pierre
was
men
tioned
and
pointing
to
his
forehead
remarked
a
bit
touched
i
always
said
so
.
i
said
from
the
first
declared
anna
pav
lovna
referring
to
pierre
i
said
at
the
time
and
before
anyone
else
she
insisted
on
her
priority
that
that
senseless
young
man
was
spoiled
by
the
depraved
ideas
of
these
days
.
i
said
so
even
at
the
time
when
everybody
was
in
raptures
about
him
when
he
had
just
re
turned
from
abroad
and
when
if
you
remem
ber
he
posed
as
a
sort
of
marat
at
one
of
my
soirees
.
and
how
has
it
ended
i
was
against
this
marriage
even
then
and
foretold
all
that
has
happened
.
anna
pavlovna
continued
to
give
on
free
eve
nings
the
same
kind
of
soirees
as
before
such
as
she
alone
had
the
gift
of
arranging
at
which
was
to
be
found
the
cream
of
really
good
so
ciety
the
bloom
of
the
intellectual
essence
of
petersburg
as
she
herself
put
it
.
besides
this
refined
selection
of
society
anna
pdvlovnas
receptions
were
also
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
she
always
presented
some
new
and
inter
esting
person
to
the
visitors
and
that
nowhere
else
was
the
state
of
the
political
thermometer
of
legitimate
petersburg
court
society
so
clear
ly
and
distinctly
indicated
.
toward
the
end
of
1806
when
all
the
sad
details
of
napoleons
destruction
of
the
prus
sian
army
at
jena
and
auerstadt
and
the
sur
render
of
most
of
the
prussian
fortresses
had
been
received
when
our
troops
had
already
entered
prussia
and
our
second
war
with
na
poleon
was
beginning
anna
pavlovna
gave
one
of
her
soirees
.
the
cream
of
really
good
soci
ety
consisted
of
the
fascinating
hlne
for
saken
by
her
husband
mortemart
the
delight

who
had
just
returned
from

the
novelty
anna

was
setting
be

that
evening
was
boris

had
just
arrived
as
a
special

from
the

and
was

a
very
important
personage

to
the

that

was

to
cause

and
us
in
general
annoyance
and
mortification
our
opinion
of

cannot
alter
.
we
shall
not
cease
to
express
our
sincere
views
on
that
subject
and
can
only
say
to
the

and
others
so
much

we
have

boris

was

up

the
guests
entered
the
drawing
room
almost
all
the
company
had
assembled
and
the
conversa
tion
guided
by
anna
pdvlovna
was
about
our
diplomatic
relations
with
austria
and
the
hope
of
an
alliance

her
.
boris
grown
more
manly
and
looking

and
selfpossessed
entered
the

elegantly
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
an

and
was
duly
conducted
to
pay
his
respects
to

then
brought
back

thanks
to
anna
mikhdylovnas
efforts
his
own
tastes
and
the
peculiarities
of
his
reserved
nature
boris
had
managed
during
his
service
to
place
himself
very
advantageously
.
he
was
aidedecamp
to
a
very
important
personage
had
been
sent
on
a
very
important
mission
to
prussia
and
had
just
returned
from
there
as
a
special
messenger
.
he
had
become
thoroughly
conversant
with
that
unwritten
code
with
which
he
had
been
so
pleased
at
olmutz
and
accord
ing
to
which
an
ensign
might
rank
incompa
rably
higher
than
a
general
and
according
to
which
what
was
needed
for
success
in
the
serv

ice
was
not
effort
or
work
or
courage
or
perse
verance
but
only
the
knowledge
of
how
to
get
on
with
those
who
can
grant
rewards
and
he
was
himself
often
surprised
at
the
rapidity
of
his
success
and
at
the
inability
of
others
to
un
derstand
these
things
.
in
consequence
of
this
discovery
his
whole
manner
of
life
all
his
re
lations
with
old
friends
all
his
plans
for
his
future
were
completely
altered
.
he
was
not
rich
but
would
spend
his
last
groat
to
be
bet
ter
dressed
than
others
and
would
rather
de
prive
himself
of
many
pleasures
than
allow
himself
to
be
seen
in
a
shabby
equipage
or
ap
pear
in
the
streets
of
petersburg
in
an
old
uni
form
.
he
made
friends
with
and
sought
the
ac
quaintance
of
only
those
above
him
in
posi
tion
and
who
could
therefore
be
of
use
to
him
.
he
liked
petersburg
and
despised
moscow
.
the
remembrance
of
the
rostovs
house
and
of
his
childish
love
for
natasha
was
unpleasant
to
him
and
he
had
not
once
been
to
see
the
rost6vs
since
the
day
of
his
departure
for
the
army
.
to
be
in
anna
pavlovnas
drawing
room
he
considered
an
important
step
up
in
the
serv
ice
and
he
at
once
understood
his
role
letting
his
hostess
make
use
of
whatever
interest
he
had
to
offer
.
he
himself
carefully
scanned
each
face
appraising
the
possibilities
of
establish
ing
intimacy
with
each
of
those
present
and
the
advantages
that
might
accrue
.
he
took
the
seat
indicated
to
him
beside
the
fair
helene
and
listened
to
the
general
conversation
.
vienna
considers
the
bases
of
the
proposed
treaty
so
unattainable
that
not
even
a
continu
ity
of
most
brilliant
successes
would
secure
them
and
she
doubts
the
means
we
have
of
gaining
them
.
that
is
the
actual
phrase
used
by
the
vienna
cabinet
said
the
danish
charge
daffaires
.
the
doubt
is
flattering
said
the
man
of
profound
intellect
with
a
subtle
smile
.
we
must
distinguish
between
the
vienna
cabinet
and
the
emperor
of
austria
said
mortemart
.
the
emperor
of
austria
can
nev
er
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
it
is
only
the
cabinet
that
says
it
.
ah

dear

called

were

pronunciation
which
she
could
allow
herself
when
con
versing

.
l
after
that
anna
pavlovna
led
up
to
the
courage
and
firmness
of
the
king
of
prussia
in
order
to
draw
boris
into
the
conversation
.
boris
listened
attentively
to
each
of
the
speakers
awaitinghis
turn
but
managed
mean
while
to
look
round
repeatedly
at
his
neigh
bor
the
beautiful
he4ene
whose
eyes
severa
times
met
those
of
the
handsome
young
aide
decamp
with
a
smile
.

speaking
of
the
position
of
prussia
ann
pdvlovna
very
naturally
asked
boris
to
te
v
them
about
his
journey
to
glogau
and
in
wha
1
state
he
found
the
prussian
army
.
boris
speak
ing
with
deliberation
told
them
in
pure
cor
rect
french
many
interesting
details
about
the
armies
and
the
court
carefully
abstaining
from
expressing
an
opinion
of
his
own
about
the
facts
he
was
recounting
.
for
some
time
he
engrossed
the
general
attention
and
anna
pdvlovna
felt
that
the
novelty
she
had
served
up
was
received
with
pleasure
by
all
her
visitors
.
the
greatest
attention
of
all
to
boris
narrative
was
shown
by
hlne
.
she
asked
him
several
questions
about
his
journey
and
seemed
greatly
interested
in
the
state
of
the
prussian
army
.
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
she
turned
to
him
with
her
usual
smile
.
you
absolutely
must
come
and
see
me
she
said
in
a
tone
that
implied
that
for
certain
con
siderations
he
could
not
know
of
this
was
ab
solutely
necessary
.
on
tuesday
between
eight
and
nine
.
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
.
boris
promised
to
fulfill
her
wish
and
was
about
to
begin
a
conversation
with
her
when
anna
pavlovna
called
him
away
on
the
pretext
that
her
aunt
wished
to
hear
him
.
you

her
husband

said
anna
pdvlovna
dosing

the
ear
of
the
company
.
bending
forward
in

armchair
he
said

laughed

everyone
turned

then
calmly

seriously
sat

for

to

but
asheseemed

wished

he
wanted
to
repeat
a
joke
he
had
heard
in
vienna
and
which
he
had
been
trying
all
that
evening
to
get
in
i
only
wished
to
say
that
we
are
wrong
to
fight
pour

l
boris
smiled
circumspectly
so
that
it
might
be
taken
as
ironical
or
appreciative
according
to
the
way
the
joke
was
received
.
everybody
laughed
.
your
joke
is
too
bad

unjust
said

shaking

at

said

the

turned

on

animated
toward

chapter
viii
the
war
was
flaming
up
and
nearing
the
rus
sian
frontier
.
everywhere
one
heard
curses
on
bonaparte
the
enemy
of
mankind
.
militia
men
and
recruits
were
being
enrolled
in
the
villages
and
from
the
seat
of

came
contra
dictory
news
false
as
usual
and
therefore
vari
ously
interpreted
.
the
life
of
old
prince
bol
k6nski
prince
andrew
and
princess
mary
had
greatly
changed
since
1805
.
in
1806
the
old
prince
was
made
one
of
the
eight
commanders
in
chief
then
appointed
to
supervise
the
enrollment
decreed
throughout
russia
.
despite
the
weakness
of
age
which
had
become
particularly
noticeable
since
the
time
when
he
thought
his
son
had
been
killed
he
did
not
think
it
right
to
refuse
a
duty
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
by
the
emperor
him
self
and
this
fresh
opportunity
for
action
gave
him
new
energy
and
strength
.
he
was
continu
ally
traveling
through
the
three
provinces
en
trusted
to
him
was
pedantic
in
the
fulfillment
of
his
duties
severe
to
cruelty
with
his
subordi
nates
and
went

everything

to

himself
.
princess
mary
had
ceased
taking
lessons
in
mathematics
from
her
father
and
when
the
old
prince
was
at
home
went
to
his
study
with
the
wet
nurse
and
little
prince
nicholas
as
his
grandfather
called
him
.
the
baby
prince
nicholas
lived
with
his
wet
nurse
and
nurse

in
the
late
prin
cess

rooms
and
princess
mary
spent
most
of
the
day
in
the
nursery
taking
a
mothers
place
to
her
little
nephew
as
best
she
could
.
made
moiselle
bourienne
too
seemed
passionately
fond
of
the
boy
and
princess
mary
often
de
prived
herself
to
give
her
friend
the
pleasure
of
dandling
the
little
angel
as
she
called
her
nephew
and
playing
with
him
.
near
the
altar
of
the
church
at
bald
hills
there
was
a
chapel
over
the
tomb
of
the
little
princess
and
in
this
chapel
was
a
marble
monu
ment
brought
from
italy
representingan
angel
with
outspread
wings
ready
to
fly
upwards
.
the
angels
upper
lip
was
slightly
raised
as
though
about
to
smile
and
once
on
coming
out
of
the
chapel
prince
andrew
and
princess
mary
admitted
to
one
another
that
the
angels
face
reminded
them
strangely
of
the
little
prin
cess
.
but
what
was
still
stranger
though
of
this
prince
andrew
said
nothing
to
his
sister
was
that
in
the
expression
the
sculptor
had
hap
pened
to
give
the
angels
face
prince
andrew
read
the
same
mild
reproach
he
had
read
on
the
face
of
his
dead
wife
ah
why
have
you
done
this
to
me
soon
after
prince
andrews
return
the
old
prince
made
over
to
him
a
large
estate
bogu
chdrovo
about
twentyfive
miles
from
bald
hills
.
partly
because
of
the
depressing
memo
ries
associated
with
bald
hills
partly
because
prince
andrew
did
not
always
feel
equal
to
bearing
with
his
fathers
peculiarities
and
part
ly
because
he
needed
solitude
prince
andrew
made
use
of
bogucharovo
began
building
and
spent
most
of
his
time
there
.
after
the
austerlitz
campaign
prince
an
drew
had
firmly
resolved
not
to
continue
his
military
service
and
when
the
war
recom
menced
and
everybody
had
to
serve
he
took
a
post
under
his
father
in
the
recruitment
so
as
to
avoid
active
service
.
the
old
prince
and
his
son
seemed
to
have
changed
roles
since
the
campaign
of
1805
.
the
old
man
roused
by
ac
tivity
expected
the
best
results
from
the
new
campaign
while
prince
andrew
on
the
con
trary
taking
no
part
in
the
war
and
secretly
regretting
this
saw
only
the
dark
side
.
on
february
26
1807
the
old
prince
set
off
on
one
of
his
circuits
.
prince
andrew
remained
at
bald
hills
as
usual
during
his
fathers
ab
sence
.
little
nicholas
had
been
unwell
for
four
days
.
the
coachman
who
had
driven
the
old
prince
to
town
returned
bringing
papers
and
letters
for
prince
andrew
.
not
finding
the
young
prince
in
his
study
the
valet
went
with
the
letters
to
princess
marys
apartments
but
did
not
find
him
there
.
he
was
told
that
the
prince
had
gone
to
the
nursery
.
if
you
please
your
excellency
petriisha
has
brought
some
papers
said
one
of
the
nurse
maids
to
prince
andrew
who
was
sitting
on
a
childs
little
chair
while
frowning
and
with
trembling
hands
he
poured
drops
from
a
medi
cine
bottle
into
a
wineglass
half
full
of
water
.
what
is
it
he
said
crossly
and
his
hand
shaking
unintentionally
he
poured
too
many
drops
into
the
glass
.
he
threw
the
mixture
on
to
the
floor
and
asked
for
some
more
water
.
the
maid
brought
it
.
there
were
in
the
room
a
childs
cot
two
boxes
two
armchairs
a
table
a
childs
table
and
the
little
chair
on
which
prince
andrew
was
sitting
.
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
a
single
candle
was
burningon
the
table
screened
by
a
bound
music
book
so
that
the
light
did
not
fall
on
the
cot
.
my

said
princess
mary
addressing
her

from
beside
the

where
she
was
standing

in

meaning
to

in

got
up
and
went
on

up
to
the

as

said
princess
mary
evident
ly
intimidated
and
confused
that
her
opinion
had
prevailed
.
she
drew
her
brothers
atten
tion
to
the
maid
who
was
calling
him
in
a
whis
per
.
it
was
the
second
night
that
neither
of
them
had
slept
watching
the
boy
who
was
in
a
high
fever
.
these
last
days
mistrusting
their
house
hold

and
expecting
another

they
had
sent
to

they
had
been
trying

one
remedy
and
then
another

worn
out
by
sleeplessness
and
anxiety
they
threw
their

and
peace
burden
of
sorrow
on
one
another
and
re
proached
and
disputed
with
each
other

the

prince
andrew
went
out

he
muttered
and
after
listening
to
the
verbal
instructions
his
father
had
sent
and
taking
the
correspondence
and
his
fathers
letter
he
returned
to
the

princess

with
a
sigh
.
prince
andrew
went
up
to
the
child
and
felt
him
.
he
was
burning
hot
.
confound
you
and
your
karl

he
took
the
glass
with
the
drops
and
again
went
up
to
the
cot

said
princess
mary
.
but
he
scowled
at
her
angrily
though
also
with
suffering
in
his
eyes
and
stooped
glass
in
hand
over
the
infant
.
but

he
said

princess
mary
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
took
the
glass
submissively
and
calling
the
nurse
began
giving
the
medicine
.
the
child
screamed
hoarsely
.
prince
andrew
winced
and
clutching
his
head
went
out
and
sat
down
on
a
sofa
in
the
next
room
.
he
still
had
all
the
letters
in
his
hand
.
open
ing
them
mechanically
he
began
reading
.
the
old
prince
now
and
then
using
abbreviations
wrote
in
his
large
elongated

and
broke
the
seal
of
another
envelope
.
it
was
a
closely
written

of

from

at

ah
well
let
him
and
he
began
reading
bil

letter
which
was
written
in
french
.
he
read
without
understanding
half
of
it
read
on
ly
to
forget
if
but
for
a
moment
what
he
had
too
long
been
thinking
of
so
painfully
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
.
chapter
ix
bilbin
was
now
at
army
headquarters
in
a
diplomatic
capacity
and
though
he
wrote
in
french
and
used
french
jests
and
french
id
ioms
he
described
the
whole
campaign
with
a
fearless
selfcensure
and
selfderision
genuine
ly
russian
.
bilfbin
wrote
that
the
obligation
of
diplomatic
discretion
tormented
him
and
he
was
happy
to
have
in
prince
andrew
a
reliable
correspondent
to
whom
he
could
pour
out
the
bile
he
had
accumulated
at
the
sight
of
all
that
was
being
done
in
the
army
.
the
letter
was
old
having
been
written
before
the
battle
at
preussischeylau
.
since
the
day
of
our
brilliant
success
at
aus
terlitz
wrote
bilfbin
as
you
know
my
dear
prince
i
never
leave
headquarters
.
i
have
cer
tainly
acquired
a
taste
for
war
and
it
is
just
as
well
for
me
what
i
have
seen
during
these
last
three
months
is
incredible
.
i
begin
ab
ovo
.
the
enemy
of
the
human
race
as
you
know
attacks
the
prussians
.
the
prussians
are
our
faithful
allies
who
have
only
betrayed
us
three
times
in
three
years
.
we
take
up
their
cause
but
it
turns
out
that
the
enemy
of
the
human
race
pays
no
heed
to
our
fine
speeches
and
in
his
rude
and
savage
way
throws
himself
on
the
prussians
without
giving
them
time
to
finish
the
parade
they
had
begun
and
in
two
twists
of
the
hand
he
breaks
them
to
smithereens
and
installs
himself
in
the
pal
ace
at
potsdam
.

to

that
your

have
hastened
to
take

steps
to
that
end

may

the
prussian
generals
pride
themselves
on
be
ing
polite
to
the
french
and
lay
down
their
arms
at
the
first
demand
.
the
head
of
the
garrison
at
glogau
with
ten
thousand
men
asks
the
king
of
prussia
what
he
is
to
do
if
he
is
summoned
to
surren
der
.

.

.

.
all
this
is
absolutely
true
.
in
short
hoping
to
settle
matters
by
taking
up
a
warlike
attitude
it
turns
out
that
we
have
landed
ourselves
in
war
and
what
is
more
in
war
on
our
own
frontiers
with
and
for
the
king
of
prussia
.
we
have
everything
in
perfect
or
der
only
one
little
thing
is
lacking
namely
a
commander
in
chief
.
as
it
was
considered
that
the
austerlitz
success
might
have
been
more
decisive
had
the
commander
in
chief
not
been
so
young
all
our
octogenarians
were
reviewed
and
of
prozor6vski
and
kmenski
the
latter
was
preferred
.
the
general
comes
to
us
suv6
rovlike
in
a
kibitka
1
and
is
received
with
ac
clamations
of
joy
and
triumph
.
on
the
4th
the
first
courier
arrives
from
petersburg
.
the
mails
are
taken
to
the
field
marshals
room
for
he
likes
to
do
everything
himself
.
i
am
called
in
to
help
sort
the
letters
and
take
those
meant
for
us
.
the
field
marshal
looks
on
and
waits
for
letters
addressed
to
him
.
we
search
but
none
are
to
be
found
.
the
field
marshal
grows
impatient
and
sets
to
work
him
self
and
finds
letters
from
the
emperor
to
count
t
.
prince
v
.
and
others
.
then
he
bursts
into
one
of
his
wild
furies
and
rages
at
every
one
and
everything
seizes
the
letters
opens
them
and
reads
those
from
the
emperor
ad
dressed
to
others
.
ah
so
thats
the
way
they
treat
me
no
confidence
in
me
ah
ordered
to
keep
an
eye
on
me
very
well
then
get
along
with
you
so
he
writes
the
famous
order
of
the
clay
to
general
bennigsen

i
am
wounded
and
cannot
ride
and
conse
quently
cannot
command
the
army
.
you
have
brought
your
army
corps
to
pultiisk
routed
here
it
is
exposed
and
without
fuel
or
forage
so
something
must
be
done
and
as
you
your
self
reported
to
count
buxhowden
yesterday
you
must
think
of
retreating
to
our

with
the
information
that

there
will
not
be
a
healthy
man
left

.

grant
leave
to
retire
to
his
country
seat
to
an
old
man
who
is
already
in
any
case
dishon
ored
by
being
unable
to
fulfill
the
great
and
glorious
task
for
which
he
was
chosen
.
i
shall
await
your
most
gracious
permission
here
in
hospital
that
i
may
not
have
to
play
the
part
of
a
secretary
rather
than
commander
in
the
army
.
my
removal
from
the
army
does
not
pro
duce
the
slightest
stir
a
blind
man
has
left
it
.
there
are
thousands
such
as
i
in
russia
.
the
field
marshal
is
angry
with
the
emper
or
and
he
punishes
us
all
isnt
it
logical
this
is
the
first
act
.
those
that
follow
are
naturally
increasingly
interesting
and
enter
taining
.
after
the
field
marshals
departure
it
appears
that
we
are
within
sight
of
the
enemy
and
must
give
battle
.
buxhowden
is
command
er
in
chief
by
seniority
but
general
bennig
sen
does
not
quite
see
it
more
particularly
as
it
is
he
and
his
corps
who
are
within
sight
of
the
enemy
and
he
wishes
to
profit
by
the
op
portunity
to
fight
a
battle
on
his
own
hand
as
the
germans
say
.
he
does
so
.
this
is
the
battle
of
pultiisk
which
is
considered
a
great
victory
but
in
my
opinion
was
nothing
of
the
kind
.
we
civilians
as
you
know
have
a
very
bad
way
of
deciding
whether
a
battle
was
won
or
lost
.
those
who
retreat
after
a
battle
have
lost
it
is
what
we
say
and
according
to
that
it
is
we
who
lost
the
battle
of
pultiisk
.
in
short
we
retreat
after
the
battle
but
send
a
courier
to
peters
burg
with
news
of
a
victory
and
general
ben
nigsen
hoping
to
receive
from
petersburg
the
post
of
commander
in
chief
as
a
reward
for
his
victory
does
not
give
up
the
command
of
the
army
to
general
buxhowden
.
during
this
in
terregnum
we
begin
a
very
original
and
inter
esting
series
of
maneuvers
.
our
aim
is
no
longer
as
it
should
be
to
avoid
or
attack
the
enemy
but
solely
to
avoid
general
buxhowden
who
by
right
of
seniority
should
be
our
chief
.
210
so
energetically
do
we
pursue
this
aim
that
aft
er
crossing
an
unfordable
river
we
burn
the
bridges
to
separate
ourselves
from
our
enemy
who
at
the
moment
is
not
bonaparte
but
bux
howden
.
general
buxhowden
was
all
but
at
tacked
and
captured
by
a
superior
enemy
force
as
a
result
of
one
of
these
maneuvers
that
en
abled
us
to
escape
him
.
buxhowden
pursues
us
we
scuttle
.
he
hardly
crosses
the
river
to
our
side
before
we
recross
to
the
other
.
at
last
our
enemy
buxhowden
catches
us
and
attacks
.
both
generals
are
angry
and
the
result
is
a
challenge
on
buxhowdens
part
and
an
epilep
tic
fit
on
bennigsens
.
but
at
the
critical
mo
ment
the
courier
who
carried
the
news
of
our
victory
at
pulttisk
to
petersburg
returns
bring
ing
our
appointment
as
commander
in
chief
and
our
first
foe
buxhowden
is
vanquished
we
can
now
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
second
bonaparte
.
but
as
it
turns
out
just
at
that
mo
ment
a
third
enemy
rises
before
usnamely
the
orthodox
russian
soldiers
loudly
demand
ing
bread
meat
biscuits
fodder
and
whatnot
the
stores
are
empty
the
roads
impassable
.
the
orthodox
begin
looting
and
in
a
way
of
which
our
last
campaign
can
give
you
no
idea
.
half
the
regiments
form
bands
and
scour
the
countryside
and
put
everything
to
fire
and
sword
.
the
inhabitants
are
totally
ruined
the
hospitals
overflow
with
sick
and
famine
is
everywhere
.
twice
the
marauders
even
attack
our
headquarters
and
the
commander
in
chief
has
to
ask
for
a
battalion
to
disperse
them
.
during
one
of
these
attacks
they
carried
off
my
empty
portmanteau
and
my
dressing
gown
.
the
emperor
proposes
to
give
all
commanders
of
divisions
the
right
to
shoot
marauders
but
i
much
fear
this
will
oblige
one
half
the
army
to
shoot
the
other
.
at
first
prince
andrew
read
with
his
eyes
only
but
after
a
while
in
spite
of
himself
al
though
he
knew
how
far
it
was
safe
to
trust
bilibin
what
he
had
read
began
to
interest
him
more
and
more
.
when
he
had
read
thus
far
he
crumpled
the
letter
up
and
threw
it
away
.
it
was
not
what
he
had
read
that
vexed
him
but
the
fact
that
the
life
out
there
in
which
he
had
now
no
part
could
perturb
him
.
he
shut
his
eyes
rubbed
his
forehead
as
if
to
rid
himself
of
all
interest
in
what
he
had
read
and
listened
to
what
was
passing
in
the
nursery
.
suddenly
he
thought
he
heard
a
strange
noise
through
the
door
.
he
was
seized
with
alarm
lest
something
should
have
happened
to
the
child
while
he
was
reading
the
letter
.
he
went
on
tiptoe
to
the
nursery
door
and
opened
it
.
war
and
peace
just
as
he
went
in
he
saw
that
the
nurse
was
hiding
something
from
him
with
a
scared
look
and
that
princess
mary
was
no
longer
by
the
cot
.
my
dear
he
heard
what
seemed
to
him
her
despairing
whisper
behind
him
.
as
often
happens
afterlongsleeplessnessand
long
anxiety
he
was
seized
by
an
unreasoning
panic
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
child
was
dead
.
all
that
he
saw
and
heard
seemed
to
con
firm
this
terror
.
all
is
over
he
thought
and
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
.
he
went
to
the
cot
in
confusion
sure
that
he
would
find
it
empty
and
that
the
nurse
had
been
hiding
the
dead
baby
.
he
drew
the
curtain
aside
and
for
some
time
his
frightened
restless
eyes
could
not
find
the
baby
.
at
last
he
saw
him
the
rosy
boy
had
tossed
about
till
he
lay
across
the
bed
with
his
head
lower
than
the
pillow
and
was
smacking
his
lips
in
his
sleep
and
breathing
evenly
.
prince
andrew
was
as
glad
to
find
the
boy
like
that
as
if
he
had
already
lost
him
.
he
bent
over
him
and
as
his
sister
had
taught
him
tried
with
his
lips
whether
the
child
was
still
feverish
.
the
soft
forehead
was
moist
.
prince
andrew
touched
the
head
with
his
hand
even
the
hair
was
wet
so
profusely
had
the
child
perspired
.
he
was
not
dead
but
evidently
the
crisis
was
over
and
he
was
convalescent
.
prince
andrew
longed
to
snatch
up
to
squeeze
to
hold
to
his
heart
this
helpless
little
creature
but
dared
not
do
so
.
he
stood
over
him
gazing
at
his
head
and
at
the
little
arms
and
legs
which
showed
under
the
blanket
.
he
heard
a
rustle
behind
him
and
a
shadow
appeared
un
der
the
curtain
of
the
cot
.
he
did
not
look
round
but
still
gazing
at
the
infants
face
lis
tened
to
his
regular
breathing
.
the
dark
shad
ow
was
princess
mary
who
had
come
up
to
the
cot
with
noiseless
steps
lifted
the
curtain
and
dropped
it
again
behind
her
.
prince
andrew
recognized
her
without
looking
and
held
out
his
hand
to
her
.
she
pressed
it
.
he
has
perspired
said
prince
andrew
.
i
was
coming
to
tell
you
so
.
the
child
movedslightly
in
his
sleepsmiled
and
rubbed
his
forehead
against
the
pillow
.
prince
andrew
looked
at
his
sister
.
in
the
dim
shadow
of
the
curtain
her
luminous
eyes
shone
more
brightly
than
usual
from
the
tears
of
joy
that
were
in
them
.
she
leaned
over
to
her
brother
and
kissed
him
slightly
catching
the
curtain
of
the
cot
.
each
made
the
other
a
warning
gesture
and
stood
still
in
the
dim
light
beneath
the
curtain
as
if
not
wishing
to
book
five
211
leave
that
seclusion
where
they
three
were
shut
off
from
all
the
world
.
prince
andrew
was
the
first
to
move
away
ruffling
his
hair
against
the
muslin
of
the
curtain
.
yes
this
is
the
one
thing
left
me
now
he
said
with
a
sigh
.
chapter
x
soon
after
his
admission
to
the
masonic
broth
erhood
pierre
went
to
the
kiev
province
where
he
had
the
greatest
number
of
serfs
tak
ing
with
him
full
directions
which
he
had
writ
ten
down
for
his
own
guidance
as
to
what
he
should
do
on
his
estates
.
when
he
reached
kiev
he
sent
for
all
his
stewards
to
the
head
office
and
explained
to
them
his
intentions
and
wishes
.
he
told
them
that
steps
would
be
taken
immediately
to
free
his
serfs
and
that
till
then
they
were
not
to
be
overburdened
with
labor
women
while
nurs
ing
their
babies
were
not
to
be
sent
to
work
assistance
was
to
be
given
to
the
serfs
punish
ments
were
to
be
admonitory
and
not
corporal
and
hospitals
asylums
and
schools
were
to
be
established
on
all
the
estates
.
some
of
the
stew
ards
there
were
semiliterate
foremen
among
them
listened
with
alarm
supposing
these
words
to
mean
that
the
young
count
was
dis
pleased
with
their
management
and
embezzle
ment
of
money
some
after
their
first
fright
were
amused
by
pierres
lisp
and
the
new
words
they
had
not
heard
before
others
simply
en
joyed
hearing
how
the
master
talked
while
the
cleverest
among
them
including
the
chief
steward
understood
from
this
speech
how
they
could
best
handle
the
master
for
their
own
ends
.
the
chief
steward
expressed
great
sympathy
with
pierres
intentions
but
remarked
that
be
sides
these
changes
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
into
the
general
state
of
affairs
which
was
far
from
satisfactory
.
despite
count
bezukhovs
enormous
wealth
since
he
had
come
into
an
income
which
was
said
to
amount
to
five
hundred
thousand
ru
bles
a
year
pierre
felt
himself
far
poorer
than
when
his
father
had
made
him
an
allowance
of
ten
thousand
rubles
.
he
had
a
dim
percep
tion
of
the
following
budget
about
80000
went
in
payments
on
all
the
estates
to
the
land
bank
about
30000
went
for
the
upkeep
of
the
estate
near
moscow
the
town
house
and
the
allowance
to
the
three
princesses
about
15000
was
given
in
pensions
and
the
same
amount
for
asylums
150000
ali
mony
was
sent
to
the
countess
about
70000
went
for
interest
on
debts
.
the
building
of
a
new
church
previously
begun
had
cost
about
10000
in
each
of
the
last
two
years
and
he
did
not
know
how
the
rest
about
100000
rubles
was
spent
and
almost
every
year
he
was
obliged
to
borrow
.
besides
this
the
chief
stew
ard
wrote
every
year
telling
him
of
fires
and
bad
harvests
or
of
the
necessity
of
rebuild
ing
factories
and
workshops
.
so
the
first
task
pierre
had
to
face
was
one
for
which
he
had
very
little
aptitude
or
inclination
practical
business
.
he
discussed
estate
affairs
every
day
with
his
chief
steward
.
but
he
felt
that
this
did
not
for
ward
matters
at
all
.
he
felt
that
these
consulta
tions
were
detached
from
real
affairs
and
did
not
link
up
with
them
or
make
them
move
.
on
the
one
hand
the
chief
steward
put
the
state
of
things
to
him
in
the
very
worst
light
pointing
out
the
necessity
of
paying
off
the
debts
and
undertaking
new
activities
with
serf
labor
to
which
pierre
did
not
agree
.
on
the
other
hand
pierre
demanded
that
steps
should
be
taken
to
liberate
the
serfs
which
the
steward
met
by
showing
the
necessity
of
first
paying
off
the
loans
from
the
land
bank
and
theconsequent
impossibility
of
a
speedy
emancipation
.
the
steward
did
not
say
it
was
quite
impos
sible
but
suggested
selling
the
forests
in
the
province
of
kostroma
the
land
lower
down
the
river
and
the
crimean
estate
in
order
to
make
it
possible
all
of
which
operations
ac
cording
to
him
were
connected
with
such
com
plicated
measuresthe
removal
of
injunctions
petitions
permits
and
so
on
that
pierre
be
came
quite
bewildered
and
only
replied
yes
yes
do
so
.
pierre
had
none
of
the
practical
persistence
that
would
have
enabled
him
to
attend
to
the
business
himself
and
so
he
disliked
it
and
only
tried
to
pretend
to
the
steward
that
he
was
at
tending
to
it
.
the
steward
for
his
part
tried
to
pretend
to
the
count
that
he
considered
these
consultations
very
valuable
for
the
proprietor
and
troublesome
to
himself
.
in
kiev
pierre
found
some
people
he
knew
and
strangers
hastened
to
make
his
acquaint
ance
and
joyfully
welcomed
the
rich
newcomer
the
largest
landowner
of
the
province
.
temp
tations
to
pierres
greatest
weakness
the
one
to
which
he
had
confessed
when
admitted
to
the
lodge
were
so
strong
that
he
could
not
re
sist
them
.
again
whole
days
weeks
and
months
of
his
life
passed
in
as
great
a
rush
and
were
as
much
occupied
with
evening
parties
dinners
lunches
and
balls
giving
him
no
time
for
re
212
war
and
peace
flection
as
in
petersburg
.
instead
of
the
new
life
he
had
hoped
to
lead
he
still
lived
the
old
life
only
in
new
surroundings
.
of
the
three
precepts
of
freemasonry
pierre
realized
that
he
did
not
fulfill
the
one
which
enjoined
every
mason
to
set
an
example
of
moral
life
and
that
of
the
seven
virtues
he
lacked
two
morality
and
the
love
of
death
.
he
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
ful
filled
another
of
the
precepts
that
of
reform
ing
the
human
race
and
had
other
virtues
love
of
his
neighbor
and
especially
generosity
.
in
the
spring
of
1807
he
decided
to
return
to
petersburg
.
on
the
way
he
intended
to
visit
all
his
estates
and
see
for
himself
how
far
his
orders
had
been
carried
out
and
in
what
state
were
the
serfs
whom
god
had
entrusted
to
his
care
and
whom
he
intended
to
benefit
.
the
chief
steward
who
considered
the
young
counts
attempts
almost
insane
unprofitable
to
himself
to
the
count
and
to
the
serfs
made
some
concessions
.
continuing
to
represent
the
liberation
of
the
serfs
as
impracticable
he
ar
ranged
for
the
erection
of
large
buildings
schools
hospitals
and
asylums
on
all
the
es
tates
before
the
master
arrived
.
everywhere
preparations
were
made
not
for
ceremonious
welcomes
which
he
knew
pierre
would
not
like
but
for
just
such
gratefully
religious
ones
with
offerings
of
icons
and
the
bread
and
salt
of
hospitality
as
according
to
his
understand
ing
of
his
master
would
touch
and
delude
him
.
the
southern
spring
the
comfortable
rapid
traveling
in
a
vienna
carriage
and
the
soli
tude
of
the
road
all
had
a
gladdening
effect
on
pierre
.
the
estates
he
had
not
before
visited
were
each
more
picturesque
than
the
other
the
serfs
everywhere
seemed
thriving
and
touch
ingly
grateful
for
the
benefits
conferred
on
them
.
everywhere
were
receptions
which
though
they
embarrassed
pierre
awakened
a
joyful
feeling
in
the
depth
of
his
heart
.
in
one
place
the
peasants
presented
him
with
bread
and
salt
and
an
icon
of
saint
peter
and
saint
paul
asking
permission
as
a
mark
of
their
gratitude
for
the
benefits
he
had
conferred
on
them
to
build
a
new
chantry
to
the
church
at
their
own
expense
in
honor
of
peter
and
paul
his
patron
saints
.
in
another
place
the
women
with
infants
in
arms
met
him
to
thank
him
for
releasing
them
from
hard
work
.
on
a
third
es
tate
the
priest
bearing
a
cross
came
to
meet
him
surrounded
by
children
whom
by
the
counts
generosity
he
was
instructing
in
read
ing
writing
and
religion
.
on
all
his
estates
pierre
saw
with
his
own
eyes
brick
buildings
erected
or
in
course
of
erection
all
on
one
plan
for
hospitals
schools
and
almshouses
which
were
soon
to
be
opened
.
everywhere
he
saw
the
stewards
accounts
according
to
which
the
serfs
manorial
labor
had
been
diminished
and
heard
the
touching
thanks
of
deputations
of
serfs
in
their
fullskirted
blue
coats
.
what
pierre
did
not
know
was
that
the
place
where
they
presented
him
with
bread
and
salt
and
wished
to
build
a
chantry
in
honor
of
peter
and
paul
was
a
market
village
where
a
fair
was
held
on
st
.
peters
day
and
that
the
richest
peasants
who
formed
the
deputation
had
begun
the
chantry
long
before
but
that
nine
tenths
of
the
peasants
in
that
village
were
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
poverty
.
he
did
not
know
that
since
the
nursing
mothers
were
no
longer
sent
to
work
on
his
land
they
did
still
harder
work
on
their
own
land
.
he
did
not
know
that
the
priest
who
met
him
with
the
cross
oppressed
the
peasants
by
his
exactions
and
that
the
pupils
parents
wept
at
having
to
let
him
take
their
children
and
secured
their
release
by
heavy
payments
.
he
did
not
know
that
the
brick
buildings
built
to
plan
were
being
built
by
serfs
whose
manorial
labor
was
thus
increased
though
lessened
on
paper
.
he
did
not
know
that
where
the
steward
had
shown
him
in
the
accounts
that
the
serfs
pay
ments
had
been
diminished
by
a
third
their
obligatory
manorial
work
had
been
increased
by
a
half
.
and
so
pierre
was
delighted
with
his
visit
to
his
estates
and
quite
recovered
the
phil
anthropic
mood
in
which
he
had
left
peters
burg
and
wrote
enthusiastic
letters
to
his
brotherinstructor
as
he
called
the
grand
master
.
how
easy
it
is
how
little
effort
it
needs
to
do
so
much
good
thought
pierre
and
how
little
attention
we
pay
to
itl
he
was
pleased
at
the
gratitude
he
received
but
felt
abashed
at
receiving
it
.
this
gratitude
reminded
him
of
how
much
more
he
might
do
for
these
simple
kindly
people
.
the
chief
steward
a
very
stupid
but
cun
ning
man
who
saw
perfectly
through
the
naive
and
intelligent
count
and
played
with
him
as
with
a
toy
seeing
the
effect
these
prearranged
receptions
had
on
pierre
pressed
him
still
harder
with
proofs
of
the
impossibility
and
above
all
the
uselessness
of
freeing
the
serfs
who
were
quite
happy
as
it
was
.
pierre
in
his
secret
soul
agreed
with
the
stew
ard
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
hap
pier
people
and
that
god
only
knew
what
would
happen
to
them
when
they
were
free
book
five
but
he
insisted
though
reluctantly
on
what
he
thought
right
.
the
steward
promised
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
carry
out
the
counts
wishes
seeing
clearly
that
not
only
would
the
count
never
be
able
to
find
out
whether
all
measures
had
been
taken
for
the
sale
of
the
land
and
forests
and
to
release
them
from
the
land
bank
but
would
probably
never
even
inquire
and
would
never
know
that
the
newly
erected
build
ings
were
standing
empty
and
that
the
serfs
continued
to
give
in
money
and
work
all
that
other
peoples
serfs
gave
that
is
to
say
all
that
could
be
got
out
of
them
.
chapter
xi
returning
from
his
journey
through
south
russia
in
the
happiest
state
of
mind
pierre
carried
out
an
intention
he
had
long
had
of
visiting
his
friend
bolk6nski
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
two
years
.
bogucharovo
lay
in
a
flat
uninteresting
part
of
the
country
among
fields
and
forests
of
fir
and
birch
which
were
partly
cut
down
.
the
house
lay
behind
a
newly
dug
pond
filled
with
water
to
the
brink
and
with
banks
still
bare
of
grass
.
it
was
at
the
end
of
a
village
that
stretched
along
the
highroad
in
the
midst
of
a
young
copse
in
which
were
a
few
fir
trees
.
the
homestead
consisted
of
a
threshing
floor
outhouses
stables
a
bathhouse
a
lodge
and
a
large
brick
house
with
semicircular
facade
still
in
course
of
construction
.
round
the
house
was
a
garden
newly
laid
out
.
the
fences
and
gates
were
new
and
solid
two
fire
pumps
and
a
water
cart
painted
green
stood
in
a
shed
the
paths
were
straight
the
bridges
were
strong
and
had
handrails
.
everything
bore
an
impress
of
tidiness
and
good
management
.
some
do
mestic
serfs
pierre
met
in
reply
to
inquiries
as
to
where
the
prince
lived
pointed
out
a
small
newly
built
lodge
close
to
the
pond
.
ant6n
a
man
who
had
looked
after
prince
andrew
in
his
boyhood
helped
pierre
out
of
his
carriage
said
that
the
prince
was
at
home
and
showed
him
into
a
clean
little
anteroom
.
pierre
was
struck
by
the
modesty
of
the
small
though
clean
house
after
the
brilliant
surround
ings
in
which
he
had
last
met
his
friend
in
petersburg
.
he
quickly
entered
the
small
reception
room
with
its
sdllun
plastered
wooden
walls
redo
lent
of
pine
and
would
have
gone
farther
but
ant6n
ran
ahead
on
tiptoe
and
knocked
at
a
door
.
well
what
is
it
came
a
sharp
unpleasant
voice
.
a
visitor
answered
ant6n
.
ask
him
to
wait
and
the
sound
was
heard
of
a
chair
being
pushed
back
.
pierre
went
with
rapid
steps
to
the
door
and
suddenly
came
face
to
face
with
prince
an
drew
who
came
out
frowning
and
looking
old
.
pierre
embraced
him
and
lifting
his
spectacles
kissed
his
friend
on
the
cheek
and
looked
at
him
closely
.
well
i
did
not
expect
you
i
am
very
glad
said
prince
andrew
.
pierre
said
nothing
he
looked
fixedly
at
his
friend
with
surprise
.
he
was
struck
by
the
change
in
him
.
his
words
were
kindly
and
there
was
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
face
but
his
eyes
were
dull
and
lifeless
and
in
spite
of
his
evident
wish
to
do
so
he
could
not
give
them
a
joyous
and
glad
sparkle
.
prince
andrew
had
grown
thinner
paler
and
more
manlylooking
but
what
amazed
and
estranged
pierre
till
he
got
used
to
it
were
his
inertia
and
a
wrinkle
on
his
brow
indicating
prolonged
concentration
on
some
one
thought
.
as
is
usually
the
case
with
people
meeting
after
a
prolonged
separation
it
was
long
be
fore
their
conversation
could
settle
on
any
thing
.
they
put
questions
and
gave
brief
re
plies
about
things
they
knew
ought
to
be
talked
over
at
length
.
at
last
the
conversation
gradu
ally
settled
on
some
of
the
topics
at
first
lightly
touched
on
their
past
life
plans
for
the
fu
ture
pierres
journeys
and
occupations
the
war
and
so
on
.
the
preoccupation
and
de
spondency
which
pierre
had
noticed
in
his
friends
look
was
now
still
more
clearly
ex
pressed
in
the
smile
with
which
he
listened
to
pierre
especially
when
he
spoke
with
joyful
animation
of
the
past
or
the
future
.
it
was
as
if
prince
andrew
would
have
liked
to
sympathize
with
what
pierre
was
saying
but
could
not
.
the
latter
began
to
feel
that
it
was
in
bad
taste
to
speak
of
his
enthusiasms
dreams
and
hopes
of
happiness
or
goodness
in
prince
andrews
presence
.
he
was
ashamed
to
express
his
new
masonic
views
which
had
been
particularly
re
vived
and
strengthened
by
his
late
tour
.
he
checked
himself
fearing
to
seem
naive
yet
he
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
show
his
friend
as
soon
as
possible
that
he
was
now
a
quite
dif
ferent
and
better
pierre
than
he
had
been
in
petersburg
.
i
cant
tell
you
how
much
i
have
lived
through
since
then
.
i
hardly
know
myself
again
.
yes
we
have
altered
much
very
much
since
then
said
prince
andrew
.
214
well
and
you
what
are
your
plans
plans
repeated
prince
andrew
ironically
.
my
plans
he
said
as
if
astonished
at
the
word
.
well
you
see
im
building
.
i
mean
to
settle
here
altogether
next
year

pierre
looked
silently
and
searchingly
into
prince
andrews
face
which
had
grown
much
older
.
no
i
meant
to
ask

.

.

.
pierre
began
but
prince
andrew
interrupted
him
.
but
why
talk
of
me

.

.

.
talk
to
me
yes
tell
me
about
your
travels
and
all
you
have
been
doing
on
your
estates
.
pierre
began
describing
what
he
had
done
on
his
estates
trying
as
far
as
possible
to
con
ceal
his
own
part
in
the
improvements
that
had
been
made
.
prince
andrew
several
times
prompted
pierres
story
of
what
he
had
been
doing
as
though
it
were
all
an
oldtime
story
and
he
listened
not
only
without
interest
but
even
as
if
ashamed
of
what
pierre
was
telling
him
.
pierre
felt
uncomfortable
and
even
depressed
in
his
friends
company
and
at
last
became
si
lent
.
ill
tell
you
what
my
dear
fellow
said
prince
andrew
who
evidently
also
felt
de
pressed
and
constrained
with
his
visitor
i
am
only
bivouacking
here
and
have
just
come
to
look
round
.
i
am
going
back
to
my
sister
today
.
i
will
introduce
you
to
her
.
but
of
course
you
know
her
already
he
said
evidently
trying
to
entertain
a
visitor
with
whom
he
now
found
nothing
in
common
.
we
will
go
after
dinner
.
and
would
you
now
like
to
look
round
my
place
they
went
out
and
walked
about
till
din
nertime
talking
of
the
political
news
and
com
mon
acquaintances
like
people
who
do
not
know
each
other
intimately
.
prince
andrew
spoke
with
some
animation
and
interest
only
of
the
new
homestead
he
was
constructing
and
its
buildings
but
even
here
while
on
the
scaf
folding
in
the
midst
of
a
talk
explaining
the
future
arrangements
of
the
house
he
inter
rupted
himself
however
this
is
not
at
all
interesting
.
let
us
have
dinner
and
then
well
set
off
.
at
dinner
conversation
turned
on
pierres
marriage
.
i
was
very
much
surprised
when
i
heard
of
it
said
prince
andrew
.
pierre
blushed
as
he
always
did
when
it
was
mentioned
and
said
hurriedly
i
will
tell
you
some
time
how
it
all
happened
.
but
you
know
it
is
all
over
and
forever
.
war
and
peace

forever
said
prince
andrew
.
nothings
forever
.
but
you
know
how
it
all
ended
dont
you
you
heard
of
the
duel
and
so
you
had
to
go
through
that
tool
one
thing
i
thank
god
for
is
that
i
did
not
kill
that
man
said
pierre
.
why
so
asked
prince
andrew
.
to
kill
a
vicious
dog
is
a
very
good
thing
really
.
no
to
kill
a
man
is
bad
wrong
.
why
is
it
wrong
urged
prince
andrew
.
it
is
not
given
to
man
to
know
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
.
men
always
did
and
always
will
err
and
in
nothing
more
than
in
what
they
consider
right
and
wrong
.
what
does
harm
to
another
is
wrong
said
pierre
feeling
with
pleasure
that
for
the
first
time
since
his
arrival
prince
andrew
was
roused
had
begun
to
talk
and
wanted
to
express
what
had
brought
him
to
his
present
state
.
and
who
has
told
you
what
is
bad
for
an
other
man
he
asked
.
bad
bad
exclaimed
pierre
.
we
all
know
what
is
bad
for
ourselves
.
yes
we
know
that
but
the
harm
i
am
con
scious
of
in
myself
is
something
i
cannot
in
flict
on
others
said
prince
andrew
growing
more
and
more
animated
and
evidently
wish
ing
to
express
his
new
outlook
to
pierre
.
he
spoke
in
french
.
i
only
know
two
very
real
evils
in
life
remorse
and
illness
.
the
only
good
is
the
absence
of
those
evils
.
to
live
for
myself
avoiding
those
two
evils
is
my
whole
philoso
phy
now
.
and
love
of
ones
neighbor
and
selfsacri
fice
began
pierre
.
no
i
cant
agree
with
you
to
live
only
so
as
not
to
do
evil
and
not
to
have
to
repent
is
not
enough
.
i
lived
like
that
i
lived
for
myself
and
ruined
my
life
.
and
only
now
when
i
am
living
or
at
least
trying
pierres
modesty
made
him
correct
himself
to
live
for
others
only
now
have
i
understood
all
the
happiness
of
life
.
no
i
shall
not
agree
with
you
and
you
do
not
really
believe
what
you
are
saying
.
prince
andrew
looked
silently
at
pierre
with
an
ironic
smile
.
when
you
sec
my
sister
princess
mary
youll
get
on
with
her
he
said
.
perhaps
you
are
right
for
yourself
he
added
after
a
short
pause
but
everyone
lives
in
his
own
way
.
you
lived
for
yourself
and
say
you
nearly
ruined
your
life
and
only
found
happiness
when
you
began
living
for
others
.
i
experienced
just
the
reverse
.
i
lived
for
glory
.
and
after
all
what
is
glory
the
same
love
of
others
a
desire
to
do
something
for
them
a
desire
for
their
approv
book
five
215
al
.
so
i
lived
for
others
and
not
almost
but
quite
ruined
my
life
.
and
i
have
become
calm
er
since
i
began
to
live
only
for
myself
.
but
what
do
you
mean
by
living
only
for
yourself
asked
pierre
growing
excited
.
what
about
your
son
your
sister
and
your
father
but
thats
just
the
same
as
myself
they
are
not
others
explained
prince
andrew
.
the
others
ones
neighbors
le
prochain
as
you
and
princess
mary
call
it
are
the
chief
source
of
all
error
and
evil
.
le
prochain
your
kiev
peasants
to
whom
you
want
to
do
good
.
and
he
looked
at
pierre
with
a
mocking
challenging
expression
.
he
evidently
wished
to
draw
him
on
.
you
are
joking
replied
pierre
growing
more
and
more
excited
.
what
error
or
evil
can
there
be
in
my
wishing
to
do
good
and
even
doing
a
littlethough
i
did
very
little
and
did
it
very
badly
what
evil
can
there
be
in
it
if
unfortunate
people
our
serfs
people
like
ourselves
were
growing
up
and
dying
with
no
idea
of
god
and
truth
beyond
ceremonies
and
meaningless
prayers
and
are
now
instructed
in
a
comforting
belief
in
future
life
retribution
recompense
and
consolation
what
evil
and
error
are
there
in
it
if
people
were
dying
of
disease
without
help
while
material
assistance
could
so
easily
be
rendered
and
i
supplied
them
with
a
doctor
a
hospital
and
an
asylum
for
the
aged
and
is
it
not
a
palpable
unques
tionable
good
if
a
peasant
or
a
woman
with
a
baby
has
no
rest
day
or
night
and
i
give
them
rest
and
leisure
said
pierre
hurrying
and
lisping
.
and
i
have
done
that
though
badly
and
to
a
small
extent
but
i
have
done
some
thing
toward
it
and
you
cannot
persuade
me
that
it
was
not
a
good
action
and
more
than
that
you
cant
make
me
believe
that
you
do
not
think
so
yourself
.
and
the
main
thing
is
he
continued
that
i
know
and
know
for
cer
tain
that
the
enjoyment
of
doing
this
good
is
the
only
sure
happiness
in
life
.
yes
if
you
put
it
like
that
its
quite
a
dif
ferent
matter
said
prince
andrew
.
i
build
a
house
and
lay
out
a
garden
and
you
build
hospitals
.
the
one
and
the
other
may
serve
as
a
pastime
.
but
whats
right
and
whats
good
must
be
judged
by
one
who
knows
all
but
not
by
us
.
well
you
want
an
argument
he
added
come
on
then
.
they
rose
from
the
table
and
sat
down
in
the
entrance
porch
which
served
as
a
veranda
.
come
lets
argue
then
said
prince
an
drew
.
you
talk
of
schools
he
went
on
crook
ing
a
finger
education
and
so
forth
that
is
you
want
to
raise
him
pointing
to
a
peasant
who
passed
by
them
taking
off
his
cap
from
his
animal
condition
and
awaken
in
him
spir
itual
needs
while
it
seems
to
me
that
animal
happiness
is
the
only
happiness
possible
and
that
is
just
what
you
want
to
deprive
him
of
.
i
envy
him
but
you
want
to
make
him
what
i
am
without
giving
him
my
means
.
then
you
say
lighten
his
toil
.
but
as
i
see
it
physical
labor
is
as
essential
to
him
as
much
a
condi
tion
of
his
existence
as
mental
activity
is
to
you
or
me
.
you
cant
help
thinking
.
i
go
to
bed
after
two
in
the
morning
thoughts
come
and
i
cant
sleep
but
toss
about
till
dawn
because
i
think
and
cant
help
thinking
just
as
he
cant
help
plowing
and
mowing
if
he
didnt
he
would
go
to
the
drink
shop
or
fall
ill
.
just
as
i
could
not
stand
his
terrible
physical
labor
but
should
die
of
it
in
a
week
so
he
could
not
stand
my
physical
idleness
but
would
grow
fat
and
die
.
the
third
thing
what
else
was
it
you
talked
about
and
prince
andrew
crooked
a
third
finger
.
ah
yes
hospitals
medicine
.
he
has
a
fit
he
is
dying
and
you
come
and
bleed
him
and
patch
him
up
.
he
will
drag
about
as
a
cripple
a
burden
to
everybody
for
another
ten
years
.
it
would
be
far
easier
and
simpler
for
him
to
die
.
others
are
being
born
and
there
are
plenty
of
them
as
it
is
.
it
would
be
different
if
you
grudged
losing
a
laborer
thats
how
i
regard
him
but
you
want
to
cure
him
from
love
of
him
.
and
he
does
not
want
that
.
and
besides
what
a
notion
that
medicine
ever
cured
anyonel
killed
them
yes
said
he
frowning
angrily
and
turning
away
from
pierre
.
prince
andrew
expressed
his
ideas
so
clearly
and
distinctly
that
it
was
evident
he
had
re
flected
on
this
subject
more
than
once
and
he
spoke
readily
and
rapidly
like
a
man
who
has
not
talked
for
a
long
time
.
his
glance
became
more
animated
as
his
conclusions
became
more
hopeless
.
oh
that
is
dreadful
dreadful
said
pierre
.
i
dont
understand
how
one
can
live
with
such
ideas
.
i
had
such
moments
myself
not
long
ago
in
moscow
and
when
traveling
but
at
such
times
i
collapsed
so
that
i
dont
live
at
all
everything
seems
hateful
to
me

.

.

.
myself
most
of
all
.
then
i
dont
eat
dont
wash

.

.

.
and
how
is
it
with
you

.

.

.
why
not
wash
that
is
not
cleanly
said
prince
andrew
on
the
contrary
one
must
try
to
make
ones
life
as
pleasant
as
possible
.
im
alive
that
is
not
my
fault
so
i
must
live
out
my
life
as
best
i
can
without
hurting
others
.
2l6
war
and
peace
but
with
such
ideas
what
motive
have
you
for
living
one
would
sit
without
moving
un
dertaking
nothing

life
as
it
is
leaves
one
no
peace
.
i
should
be
thankful
to
do
nothing
but
here
on
the
one
hand
the
local
nobility
have
done
me
the
hon
or
to
choose
me
to
be
their
marshal
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
get
out
of
it
.
they
could
not
un
derstand
that
i
have
not
the
necessary
qualifi
cations
for
it
the
kind
of
goodnatured
fussy
shallowness
necessary
for
the
position
.
then
theres
this
house
which
must
be
built
in
or
der
to
have
a
nook
of
ones
own
in
which
to
be
quiet
.
and
now
theres
this
recruiting
.
why
arent
you
serving
in
the
army
after
austerlitz
said
prince
andrew
gloomily
.
no
thank
you
very
much
i
have
promised
myself
not
to
serve
again
in
the
ac
tive
russian
army
.
and
i
wont
not
even
if
bonaparte
were
here
at
smolensk
threatening
bald
hills
even
then
i
wouldnt
serve
in
the
russian
armyl
well
as
i
was
saying
he
con
tinued
recovering
his
composure
now
theres
this
recruiting
.
my
father
is
chief
in
command
of
the
third
district
and
my
only
way
of
avoiding
active
service
is
to
serve
under
him
.
then
you
are
serving
i
am
.
he
paused
a
little
while
.
and
why
do
you
serve
why
for
this
reason
my
father
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
of
his
time
.
but
he
is
growing
old
and
though
not
exactly
cruel
he
has
too
energetic
a
character
.
he
is
so
ac
customed
to
unlimited
power
that
he
is
terri
ble
and
now
he
has
this
authority
of
a
com
mander
in
chief
of
the
recruiting
granted
by
the
emperor
.
if
i
had
been
two
hours
late
a
fortnight
ago
he
would
have
had
a
paymasters
clerk
at
yiikhnovna
hanged
said
prince
an
drew
with
a
smile
.
so
i
am
serving
because
i
alone
have
any
influence
with
my
father
and
now
and
then
can
save
him
from
actions
which
would
torment
him
afterwards
.
well
there
you
see
yes
but
it
is
not
as
you
imagine
prince
andrew
continued
.
i
did
not
and
do
not
in
the
least
care
about
that
scoundrel
of
a
clerk
who
had
stolen
some
boots
from
the
recruits
i
should
even
have
been
very
glad
to
see
him
hanged
but
i
was
sorry
for
my
father
that
again
is
for
myself
.
prince
andrew
grew
more
and
more
ani
mated
.
his
eyes
glittered
feverishly
while
he
tried
to
prove
to
pierre
that
in
his
actions
there
was
no
desire
to
do
good
to
his
neighbor
.
there
now
you
wish
to
liberate
your
serfs
he
continued
that
is
a
very
good
thing
but
not
for
you
i
dont
suppose
you
ever
had
any
one
flogged
or
sent
to
siberia
and
still
less
for
your
serfs
.
if
they
are
beaten
flogged
or
sent
to
siberia
i
dont
suppose
they
are
any
the
worse
off
.
in
siberia
they
lead
the
same
animal
life
and
the
stripes
on
their
bodies
heal
and
they
are
happy
as
before
.
but
it
is
a
good
thing
for
proprietors
who
perish
morally
bring
re
morse
upon
themselves
stifle
this
remorse
and
grow
callous
as
a
result
of
being
able
to
inflict
punishments
justly
and
unjustly
.
it
is
those
peo
ple
i
pity
and
for
their
sake
i
should
like
to
liberate
the
serfs
.
you
may
not
have
seen
but
i
have
seen
how
good
men
brought
up
in
those
traditions
of
unlimited
power
in
time
when
they
grow
more
irritable
become
cruel
and
harsh
are
conscious
of
it
but
cannot
restrain
themselves
and
grow
more
and
more
misera
ble
.
prince
andrew
spoke
so
earnestly
that
pierre
could
not
help
thinking
that
these
thoughts
had
been
suggested
to
prince
andrew
by
his
fathers
case
.
he
did
not
reply
.
so
thats
what
im
sorry
for
human
dignity
peace
of
mind
purity
arid
not
the
serfs
backs
and
foreheads
which
beat
and
shave
as
you
may
always
remain
the
same
backs
and
fore
heads
.
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
i
shall
never
agree
with
you
said
pierre
.
chapter
xii
in
the
evening
andrew
and
pierre
got
into
the
open
carriage
and
drove
to
bald
hills
.
prince
andrew
glancing
at
pierre
broke
the
silence
now
and
then
with
remarks
which
showed
that
he
was
in
a
good
temper
.
pointing
to
the
fields
he
spoke
of
the
im
provements
he
was
making
in
his
husbandry
.
pierre
remained
gloomily
silent
answering
in
monosyllables
and
apparently
immersed
in
his
own
thoughts
.
he
was
thinking
that
prince
andrew
was
unhappy
had
gone
astray
did
not
see
the
true
light
and
that
he
pierre
ought
to
aid
en
lighten
and
raise
him
.
but
as
soon
as
he
thought
of
what
he
should
say
he
felt
that
prince
andrew
with
one
word
one
argument
would
upset
all
his
teaching
and
he
shrank
from
beginning
afraid
of
exposing
to
possible
ridicule
what
to
him
was
precious
and
sacred
.
no
but
why
do
you
think
so
pierre
sud
denly
began
lowering
his
head
and
looking
book
five
217
like
a
bull
about
to
charge
why
do
you
think
so
you
should
not
think
so
.
think
what
about
asked
prince
andrew
with
surprise
.
about
life
about
mans
destiny
.
it
cant
be
so
.
i
myself
thought
like
that
and
do
you
know
what
saved
me
freemasonry
no
dont
smile
.
freemasonry
is
not
a
religious
ceremonial
sect
as
i
thought
it
was
freemasonry
is
the
best
ex
pression
of
the
best
the
eternal
aspects
of
hu
manity
.
and
he
began
to
explain
freemasonry
as
he
understood
it
to
prince
andrew
.
he
said
that
freemasonry
is
the
teaching
of
christianity
freed
from
the
bonds
of
state
and
church
a
teaching
of
equality
brotherhood
and
love
.
only
our
holy
brotherhood
has
the
real
meaning
of
life
all
the
rest
is
a
dream
said
pierre
.
understand
my
dear
fellow
that
out
side
this
union
all
is
filled
with
deceit
and
falsehood
and
i
agree
with
you
that
nothing
is
left
for
an
intelligent
and
good
man
but
to
live
out
his
life
like
you
merely
trying
not
to
harm
others
.
but
make
our
fundamental
con
victions
your
own
join
our
brotherhood
give
yourself
up
to
us
let
yourself
be
guided
and
you
will
at
once
feel
yourself
as
i
have
felt
my
self
a
part
of
that
vast
invisible
chain
the
be
ginning
of
which
is
hidden
in
heaven
said
pierre
.
prince
andrew
looking
straight
in
front
of
him
listened
in
silence
to
pierres
words
.
more
than
once
when
the
noise
of
the
wheels
pre
vented
his
catching
wliat
pierre
said
he
asked
him
to
repeat
it
and
by
the
peculiar
glow
that
came
into
prince
andrews
eyes
and
by
his
silence
pierre
saw
that
his
words
were
not
in
vain
and
that
prince
andrew
would
not
in
terrupt
him
or
laugh
at
what
he
said
.
they
reached
a
river
that
had
overflowed
its
banks
and
which
they
had
to
cross
by
ferry
.
while
the
carriage
and
horses
were
beingplaced
on
it
they
also
stepped
on
the
raft
.
prince
andrew
leaning
his
arms
on
the
raft
railing
gazed
silently
at
the
flooding
waters
glittering
in
the
setting
sun
.
well
what
do
you
think
about
it
pierre
asked
.
why
are
you
silent
what
do
i
think
about
it
i
am
listening
to
you
.
its
all
very
well
.

.

.

.
you
say
join
our
brotherhood
and
we
will
show
you
the
aim
of
life
the
destiny
of
man
and
the
laws
which
gov
ern
the
world
.
but
who
are
we
men
.
how
is
it
you
know
everything
why
do
i
alone
not
see
what
you
see
you
see
a
reign
of
goodness
and
truth
on
earth
but
i
dont
see
it
.
pierre
interrupted
him
.
do
you
believe
in
a
future
life
he
asked
.
a
futurelife
prince
andrew
repeated
but
pierre
giving
him
no
time
to
reply
took
the
repetition
for
a
denial
the
more
readily
as
he
knew
prince
andrews
former
atheistic
con
victions
.
you
say
you
cant
see
a
reign
of
goodness
and
truth
on
earth
.
nor
could
i
and
it
can
not
be
seen
if
one
looks
on
our
life
here
as
the
end
of
everything
.
on
earth
f
here
on
this
earth
pierre
pointed
to
the
fields
there
is
no
truth
all
is
false
and
evil
but
in
the
universe
in
the
whole
universe
there
is
a
kingdom
of
truth
and
we
who
are
now
the
children
of
earth
are
eternallychildren
of
the
whole
uni
verse
.
dont
i
feel
in
my
soul
that
i
am
part
of
this
vast
harmonious
whole
dont
i
feel
that
i
form
one
link
one
step
between
the
lower
and
higher
beings
in
this
vast
harmonious
mul
titude
of
beings
in
whom
the
deity
the
su
preme
power
if
you
prefer
the
term
is
mani
fest
if
i
see
clearly
see
that
ladder
leading
from
plant
to
man
why
should
i
suppose
it
breaks
off
at
me
and
does
not
go
farther
and
farther
i
feel
that
i
cannot
vanish
since
noth
ing
vanishes
in
this
world
but
that
i
shall
al
ways
exist
and
always
have
existed
.
i
feel
that
beyond
me
and
above
me
there
are
spirits
and
that
in
this
world
there
is
truth
.
yes
that
is
herders
theory
said
prince
andrew
but
it
is
not
that
which
can
convince
me
dear
friend
life
and
death
are
what
con
vince
.
what
convinces
is
when
one
sees
a
be
ing
dear
to
one
bound
up
with
ones
own
life
before
whom
one
was
to
blame
and
had
hoped
to
make
it
right
prince
andrews
voice
trem
bled
and
he
turned
away
and
suddenly
that
being
is
seized
with
pain
suffers
and
ceases
to
exist
.

.

.

.
why
it
cannot
be
that
there
is
no
answer
.
and
i
believe
there
is
thats
what
convinces
that
is
what
has
convinced
me
said
prince
andrew
.
yes
yes
of
course
said
pierre
isnt
that
what
im
saying
no
.
all
i
say
is
that
it
is
not
argument
that
convinces
me
of
the
necessity
of
a
future
life
but
this
when
you
go
hand
in
hand
with
some
one
and
all
at
once
that
person
vanishes
there
into
nowhere
and
you
yourself
are
left
facing
that
abyss
and
look
in
.
and
i
have
looked
in
.

.

.

.
well
thats
it
then
you
know
that
there
is
a
there
and
there
is
a
someone
there
is
the
future
life
.
the
someone
is
god
.
prince
andrew
did
not
reply
.
the
carriage
2l8
war
and
peace
and
horses
had
long
since
been
taken
off
onto
the
farther
bank
and
reharnessed
.
the
sun
had
sunk
half
below
the
horizon
and
an
eve
ning
frost
was
starring
the
puddles
near
the
fer
ry
but
pierre
and
andrew
to
the
astonishment
of
the
footmen
coachmen
and
ferrymen
still
stood
on
the
raft
and
talked
.
if
there
is
a
god
and
future
life
there
is
truth
and
good
and
mans
highest
happiness
consists
in
striving
to
attain
them
.
we
must
live
we
must
love
and
we
must
believe
that
we
live
not
only
today
on
this
scrap
of
earth
but
have
lived
and
shall
live
forever
there
in
the
whole
said
pierre
and
he
pointed
to
the
sky
.
prince
andrew
stood
leaning
on
the
railing
of
theraft
listening
to
pierre
and
he
gazed
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
red
reflection
of
the
sun
gleaming
on
the
blue
waters
.
there
was
per
fect
stillness
.
pierre
became
silent
.
the
raft
had
long
since
stopped
and
only
the
waves
of
the
current
beat
softly
against
it
below
.
prince
an
drew
felt
as
if
the
sound
of
the
waves
kept
up
a
refrain
to
pierres
words
whispering
it
is
true
believe
it
.
he
sighed
and
glanced
with
a
radiant
child
like
tender
look
at
pierres
face
flushed
and
rapturous
but
yet
shy
before
his
superior
friend
.
yes
if
it
only
were
sol
said
prince
andrew
.
however
it
is
time
to
get
on
he
added
and
stepping
off
the
raft
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
to
which
pierre
had
pointed
and
for
the
first
time
since
austerlitz
saw
that
high
everlasting
sky
he
had
seen
while
lying
on
that
battlefield
and
something
that
had
long
been
slumbering
something
that
was
best
within
him
sudden
ly
awoke
joyful
and
youthful
in
his
soul
.
it
vanished
as
soon
as
he
returned
to
the
custom
ary
conditions
of
his
life
but
he
knew
that
this
feeling
which
he
did
not
know
how
to
develop
existed
within
him
.
his
meeting
with
pierre
formed
an
epoch
in
prince
andrews
life
.
though
outwardly
he
continued
to
live
in
the
same
old
way
inwardly
he
began
a
new
life
.
chapter
xiii
it
was
getting
dusk
when
prince
andrew
and
pierre
drove
up
to
the
front
entrance
of
the
house
at
bald
hills
.
as
they
approached
the
house
prince
andrew
with
a
smile
drew
pierres
attention
to
a
commotion
going
on
at
the
back
porch
.
a
woman
bent
with
age
with
a
wallet
on
her
back
and
a
short
longhaired
young
man
in
a
black
garment
had
rushed
back
to
the
gate
on
seeing
the
carriage
driving
up
.
two
women
ran
out
after
them
and
all
four
look
ing
round
at
the
carriage
ran
in
dismay
up
the
steps
of
the
back
porch
.
those
are
marys
gods
folk

said
prince
andrew
.
they
have
mistaken
us
for
my
father
.
this
is
the
one
matter
in
which
she
disobeys
him
.
he
orders
these
pilgrims
to
be
driven
away
but
she
receives
them
.
but
what
are
gods
folk
asked
pierre
.
prince
andrew
had
no
time
to
answer
.
the
servants
came
out
to
meet
them
and
he
asked
where
the
old
prince
was
and
whether
he
was
expected
back
soon
.
the
old
prince
had
gone
to
the
town
and
was
expected
back
any
minute
.
prince
andrew
led
pierre
to
his
own
apart
ments
which
were
always
kept
in
perfect
order
and
readiness
for
him
in
his
fathers
house
he
himself
went
to
the
nursery
.
let
us
go
and
see
my
sister
he
said
to
pierre
when
he
returned
.
i
have
not
found
her
yet
she
is
hiding
now
sitting
with
her
gods
folk
.
it
will
serve
her
right
she
will
be
confused
but
you
will
see
her
gods
folk
.
its
really
very
curious
.
what
are
gods
folk
asked
pierre
.
come
and
youll
see
for
yourself
.
princess
mary
really
was
disconcerted
and
red
patches
came
on
her
face
when
they
went
in
.
in
her
snug
room
with
lamps
burning
be
fore
the
icon
stand
a
young
lad
with
a
long
nose
and
long
hair
wearing
a
monks
cassock
sat
on
the
sofa
beside
her
behind
a
samovar
.
near
them
in
an
armchair
sat
a
thin
shriveled
old
woman
with
a
meek
expression
on
her
childlike
face
.
andrew
why
didnt
you
warn
me
said
the
princess
with
mild
reproach
as
she
stood
be
fore
her
pilgrims
like
a
hen
before
her
chick
ens
.
charmde

l
she
said
to
pierre
as
he
kissed
her
hand
.
she
had
known
him
as
a
child
and
now
his
friendship
with
andrew
his
misfor
tune
with
his
wife
and
above
all
his
kindly
simple
face
disposed
her
favorably
toward
him
.
she
looked
at
him
with
her
beautiful
radiant
eyes
and
seemed
to
say
i
like
you
very
much
but
please
dont
laugh
at
my
people
.
after
exchanging
the
first
greetings
they
sat
down
.

said
prince
andrew
glancing
with
a
smile
at
the
young
pilgrim

.
it
was
evident
that
prince
andrews
ironical
tone
toward
the
pilgrims
and
princess
marys
helpless
attempts
to
protect
them
were
their
customary

said
pierre
gazing
over
his
spec
tacles
with
curiosity
and
seriousness
forwhich
princess
mary
was
specially
grateful
to
him
into
ivanushkas
face
who
seeing
that
she
was
being
spoken
about
looked
round
at
them
all
with
crafty
eyes
.
princess
marys
embarrassment
on
her
peo
ples
account
was
quite
unnecessary
.
they
were
not
in
the
least
abashed
.
the
old
woman
low
ering
her
eyes
but
casting
side
glances
at
the
newcomers
had
turned
her
cup
upside
down
and
placed
a
nibbled
bit
of
sugar
beside
it
and
sat
quietly
in
her
armchair
though
hoping
to
be
offered
another
cup
of
tea
.

out

prince
andrew
asked
the
old
woman
.

she
answered
garrulously
.
just
at
christmastime
i
was
deemed
worthy
to
partake
of
the
holy
and
heavenly
sacrament
at
the
shrine
of
the
saint
.
and
now

said
ivdnushka
trying
to
speak
in
a
bass
voice
.
i
only
came
across
pelageya
in
yiikhnovo
.

.

.

her
companion
she
evidently
wished
to
tell
what
she
had
seen

but
my

you

on

contrary
to
be
grateful
to
me
for

with
this
young

where
a
wonderworking
icon
of
the
holy

been
revealed
.
on
hearing
those
words
i
said
goodby
to
the
holy
folk
and
went
.
all
were
silent
only
the
pilgrim
woman
went
on
in
measured
tones
drawing
in
her
breath
.
so
i
come
master
and
the
people
say
tome
a
great
blessing

holy
oil
trickles
from
the
cheeks
of

the
holy

mother

.

.

.

.
all
right
all
right

after
wards
said
princess
mary
flushing
.
let
me
ask
her
said
pierre
.
did
you
see
it
yourselves
he
inquired
.
oh
yes
master
i
was
found
worthy
.
such
a
brightness
on
the
face
like
the
light
of
heaven
and
from
the
blessed
mothers
cheek
it
drops
and
drops
.

.

.

.
but
dear
me
that
must
be
a
fraud
said
pierre
naively
who
had
listened
attentively
to
the
pilgrim
.
oh
master
what
are
you
say
ing
exclaimed
the
horrified
pelage
ya
turn
ing
to
princess

for
support

repeated

exclaimed
the

woman
crossing
herself
.
oh

master

there
was
a
general
who
did
not
be
lieve
and
said
the
monks
cheat
and
as
soon
as
hed
said
it
he
went
blind
.
and
he
dreamed
that
the
holy
virgin
mother
of
the
kiev
cata
combs
came
to
him
and
said
believe
in
meand
i
will
make
you
whole
.
so
he
begged
take
me
to
her
take
me
to
her
.
its
the
real
truth
im
telling
you
i
saw
it
myself
.
so
he
was
brought
quite
blind
straight
to
her
and
he
goes
up
to
her
and
falls
down
and
says
make
me
whole
says
he
and
ill
give
thee
what
the
tsar
bestowed
on
me
.
i
saw
it
myself
master
the
star
is
fixed
into
the
icon
.
well
and
what
do
you
think
he
received
his
sight
its
a
sin
to
speak
so
.
god
will
punish
you
she
said
ad
monishingly
turning
to
pierre
.
how
did
the
star
get
into
the
icon
pierre
asked
.
and
was
the
holy
mother
promoted
to
the
rank
of
general
said
prince
andrew
with
a
smile
.
pelagcya
suddenly
grew
quite
pale
and
clasped
her
hands

her
pallor
sud

turning
to
a
vivid
red
.
master
what
have
you
said
god
forgive

and
she
crossed
herself
.
lord
forgive

my
dear
what
does
it

.

.

.
she
asked
turning
to
princess
mary
.
she
got
up
and
almost
crying
began
to
arrange
her
wallet
.
she
evidently
felt
frightened
and
ashamed
to
have
accepted
char
ity
in
a
house
where
such
things
could
be
said
and
was
at
the
same
time
sorry
to
have
now
to
forgo
the
charity
of
this
house
.
now
why
need
you
do
it
said
princess
mary
.
why
did
you
come
to

he
said
smiling
shyly
and
trying
to
efface
his
offense
.
it
was
all
my
fault
and
andrew
was
only
joking
.
pelagya
stopped
doubtfully
but
in
pierres
face
there
was
such
a
look
of
sincere
penitence
and
prince
andrew
glanced
so
meekly
now
at
her
and
now
at
pierre
that
she
was
gradually
reassured
.
chapter
xiv
the
pilgrim
woman
was
appeased
and
being
encouraged
to
talk
gave
a
long
account
of
fa
ther
amphilochus
who
led
so
holy
a
life
that
his
hands
smelled
of
incense
and
how
on
her
last
visit
to
kiev
some
monks
she
knew
let
her
have
the
keys
of
the
catacombs
and
how
she
taking
some
dried
bread
with
her
had
spent
two
days
in
the
catacombs
with
the
saints
.
id
pray
awhile
to
one
ponder
awhile
then
go
on
to
another
.
id
sleep
a
bit
and
then
again
go
and
kiss
the
relics
and
there
was
such
peace
all
around
such
blessedness
that
one
dont
want
to
come
out
even
into
the
light
of
heaven
again
.
pierre
listened
to
her
attentively
and
serious
ly
.
prince
andrew
went
out
of
the
room
and
then
leaving
gods
folk
to
finish
their
tea
princess
mary
took
pierre
into
the
drawing
room
.
you
are
very
kind
she
said
to
him
.
oh
i
really
did
not
mean
to
hurt
her
feel
ings
.
i
understand
them
so
well
and
have
the
greatest
respect
for
them
.
princess
mary
looked
at
him
silently
and
smiled
affectionately
.
i
have
known
you
a
long
time
you
see
and
am
as
fond
of
you
as
of
a
brother
she
said
.

princess
on
my
word
i
did
not
wish
to
offend
her
how
do
you
find
andrew
she
added
hur
riedly
not
giving
him
time
to
reply
to
her
af
fectionate
words
.
i
am
very
anxious
about
him
.
his
health
was
better
in
the
winter
but
last
spring
his
wound
reopened
and
the
doctor
said
he
ought
to
go
away
for
a
cure
.
and
i
am
also
very
much
afraid
for
him
spiritually
.
he
has
not
a
character
like
us
women
who
when
we
suffer
can
weep
away
our
sorrows
.
he
keeps
it
all
within
him
.
today
he
is
cheerful
and
in
good
spirits
but
that
is
the
effect
of
your
visit
he
is
not
often
like
that
.
if
you
could
per
suade
him
to
go
abroad
.
he
needs
activity
and
this
quiet
regular
life
is
very
bad
for
him
.
oth
ers
dont
notice
it
but
i
see
it
.
toward
ten
oclock
the
menservants
rushed
to
the
front
door
hearing
the
bells
of
the
old
princes
carriage
approaching
.
prince
andrew
and
pierre
also
went
out
into
the
porch
.
whos
that
asked
the
old
prince
notic
ing
pierre
as
he
got
out
of
the
carriage
.
ah
very
glad
kiss
me
he
said
having
learned
who
the
young
stranger
was
.
the
old
prince
was
in
a
good
temper
and
very
gracious
to
pierre
.
before
supper
prince
andrew
coming
back
to
his
fathers
study
found
him
disputing
hot
ly
with
his
visitor
.
pierre
was
maintaining
that
a
time
would
come
when
there
would
be
no
more
wars
.
the
old
prince
disputed
it
chaffing
ly
but
without
getting
angry
.
drain
the
blood
from
mens
veins
and
put
in
water
instead
then
there
will
be
no
more
war
old
womens
nonsense
old
womens
nonsense
he
repeated
but
still
he
patted
pierre
affectionately
on
the
shoulder
and
then
went
up
to
the
table
where
prince
andrew
ev
idently
not
wishing
to
join
in
the
conversation
was
looking
over
the
papers
his
father
had
brought
from
town
.
the
old
prince
went
up
to
him
and
began
to
talk
business
.
the
marshal
a
count
rost6v
hasnt
sent
half
his
contingent
.
he
came
to
town
and
wanted
to
invite
me
to
dinner
i
gave
him
a
pretty
dinner

.

.

.
and
there
look
at
this
.

.

.

.
well
my
boy
the
old
prince
went
on
address
ing
his
son
and
patting
pierre
on
the
shoulder
.

fine
fellow
your

i
like

stirs
me

things
and

but
this

bish

up
.
well

well

dispute
.

friends
with
my
little
fool
princess
mary
he
shouted
after
pierre
through
the
door
.
only
now
on
his
visit
to
bald
hills
did
book
five
pierre
fully
realize
the
strength
and
charm
of
his
friendship
with
prince
andrew
.
that
charm
was
not
expressed
so
much
in
his
relations
with
him
as
with
all
his
family
and
with
the
house
hold
.
with
the
stern
old
prince
and
the
gen
tle
timid
princess
mary
though
he
had
scarce
ly
known
them
pierre
at
once
felt
like
an
old
friend
.
they
were
all
fond
of
him
already
.
not
only
princess
mary
who
had
been
won
by
his
gentleness
with
the

as

chapter
xv
when
returning
from
his
leave
rostov
felt
for
the
first
time
how
close
was
the
bond
that
united
him
to
denfsovand
the
whole
regiment
.
on
approaching
it
rost6v
felt
as
he
had
done
when
approaching
his
home
in
moscow
.
when
he
saw
the
first
hussar
with
the
unbut
toned
uniform
of
his
regiment
when
he
rec
ognized
redhaired
demntyev
and
saw
the
picket
ropes
of
the
roan
horses
when
lavru
shka
gleefully
shouted
to
his
master
the
count
has
cornel
and
denfsov
who
had
been
asleep
on
his
bed
ran
all
disheveled
out
of
the
mud
hut
to
embrace
him
and
the
officers
col
lected
round
to
greet
the
new
arrival
rostov
experienced
the
same
feeling
as
when
his
moth
er
his
father
and
his
sister
had
embraced
him
and
tears
of
joy
choked
him
so
that
he
could
not
speak
.
the
regiment
was
also
a
home
and
as
unalterably
dear
and
precious
as
his
parents
house
.
when
he
had
reported
himself
to
the
com
mander
of
the
regiment
and
had
been
reas
signed
to
his
former
squadron
had
been
on
duty
and
had
gone
out
foraging
when
he
had
again
entered
into
all
the
little
interests
of
the
regiment
and
felt
himself
deprived
of
liberty
and
bound
in
one
narrow
unchanging
frame
he
experienced
the
same
sense
of
peace
of
mor
al
support
and
the
same
senseof
being
at
home
here
in
his
own
place
as
he
had
felt
under
the
parental
roof
.
but
here
was
none
of
all
that
turmoil
of
the
world
at
large
where
he
did
not
know
his
right
place
and
took
mistaken
deci
sions
here
was
no
scsnya
with
whom
he
ought
or
ought
not
to
have
an
explanation
here
was
no
possibility
of
going
there
or
not
going
there
here
there
were
not
twenty
four
hours
in
the
day
which
could
be
spent
in
such
a
variety
of
ways
there
was
not
that
innumerable
crowd
of
people
of
whom
not
one
was
nearer
to
him
or
farther
from
him
than
another
there
were
none
of
those
uncertain
and
undefined
money
relations
with
his
father
and
nothing
to
recall
that
terrible
loss
to
d61okhov
.
here
in
the
reg
iment
all
was
clear
and
simple
.
the
whole
world
was
divided
into
two
unequal
parts
one
our
pdvlograd
regiment
the
other
all
the
rest
.
and
the
rest
was
no
concern
of
his
.
in
the
regi
ment
everything
was
definite
who
was
lieu
tenant
who
captain
who
was
a
good
fellow
who
a
bad
one
and
most
of
all
who
was
a
com
rade
.
the
canteenkeeper
gave
one
credit
ones
pay
came
every
four
months
there
was
nothing
to
think
out
or
decide
you
had
only
to
do
noth
ing
that
was
considered
bad
in
the
pavlograd
regiment
and
when
given
an
order
to
do
what
was
clearly
distinctly
and
definitely
ordered
and
all
would
be
well
.
having
once
more
entered
into
the
definite
conditions
of
this
regimental
life
rost6v
felt
the
joy
and
relief
a
tired
man
feels
on
lying
down
to
rest
.
life
in
the
regiment
during
this
campaign
was
all
the
pleasanter
for
him
be
cause
after
his
loss
to
d61okhov
for
which
in
spite
of
all
his
familys
efforts
to
console
him
he
could
not
forgive
himself
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
atone
for
his
fault
by
serving
not
as
he
had
done
before
but
really
well
and
by
being
a
perfectly
firstrate
comrade
and
officer
in
a
word
a
splendid
man
altogether
a
thing
which
seemed
so
difficult
out
in
the
world
but
so
possible
in
the
regiment
.
after
his
losses
he
had
determined
to
pay
back
his
debt
to
his
parents
in
five
years
.
he
re
ceived
ten
thousand
rubles
a
year
but
now
re
solved
to
take
only
two
thousand
and
leave
the
rest
to
repay
the
debt
to
his
parents
.
our
army
after
repeated
retreats
and
ad
vances
and
battles
at
pultiisk
and
preussisch
eylau
was
concentrated
near
bartenstein
.
it
was
awaiting
the
emperors
arrival
and
the
be
ginning
of
a
new
campaign
.
the
pdvlograd
regiment
belonging
to
that
22
war
and
peace
part
of
the
army
which
had
served
in
the
1805
campaign
had
been
recruiting
up
to
strength
in
russia
and
arrived
too
late
to
take
part
in
the
first
actions
of
the
campaign
.
it
had
been
neither
at
pultusk
nor
at
preussischeylau
and
when
it
joined
the
army
in
the
field
in
the
sec
ond
half
of
the
campaign
was
attached
to
pld
tovs
division
.
pldtovs
division
was
acting
independently
of
the
main
army
.
several
times
parts
of
the
pdvlograd
regiment
had
exchanged
shots
with
the
enemy
had
taken
prisoners
and
once
had
even
captured
marshal
oudinots
carriages
.
in
april
the
pdvlograds
were
stationed
immova
bly
for
some
weeks
near
a
totally
ruined
and
deserted
german
village
.
a
thaw
had
set
in
it
was
muddy
and
cold
the
ice
on
the
river
broke
and
the
roads
be
came
impassable
.
for
days
neither
provisions
for
the
men
nor
fodder
for
the
horses
had
been
issued
.
as
no
transports
could
arrive
the
men
dispersed
about
the
abandoned
and
deserted
villages
searching
for
potatoes
but
found
few
even
of
these
.
everything
had
been
eaten
up
and
the
in
habitants
had
all
fled
if
any
remained
they
were
worse
than
beggars
and
nothing
more
could
be
taken
from
them
even
the
soldiers
usually
pitiless
enough
instead
of
taking
any
thing
from
them
often
gave
them
the
last
of
their
rations
.
the
pdvlograd
regiment
had
had
only
two
men
wounded
in
action
but
had
lost
nearly
half
its
men
from
hunger
and
sickness
.
in
the
hos
pitals
death
was
so
certain
that
soldiers
suffer
ing
from
fever
or
the
swelling
that
came
from
bad
food
preferred
to
remain
on
duty
and
hardly
able
to
drag
their
legs
went
to
the
front
rather
than
to
the
hospitals
.
when
spring
came
on
the
soldiers
found
a
plant
just
showing
out
of
the
ground
that
looked
like
asparagus
which
for
some
.
reason
they
called
mdshkas
sweet
root
.
it
was
very
bitter
but
they
wandered
about
the
fields
seeking
it
and
dug
it
out
with
their
sabers
and
ate
it
though
they
were
or
dered
not
to
do
so
as
it
was
a
noxious
plant
.
that
spring
a
new
disease
broke
out
among
the
soldiers
a
swelling
of
the
arms
legs
and
face
which
the
doctors
attributed
to
eating
this
root
.
but
in
spite
of
all
this
the
soldiers
of
denisovs
squadron
fed
chiefly
on
mdshkas
sweet
root
because
it
was
the
second
week
that
the
last
of
the
biscuits
were
being
doled
out
at
the
rate
of
half
a
pound
a
man
and
the
last
potatoes
re
ceived
had
sprouted
and
frozen
.
the
horses
also
had
been
fed
for
a
fortnight
on
straw
from
the
thatched
roofs
and
had
be
come
terribly
thin
though
still
covered
with
tufts
of
felty
winter
hair
.
despite
this
destitution
the
soldiers
and
of
ficers
went
on
living
just
as
usual
.
despite
their
pale
swollen
faces
and
tattered
uniforms
the
hussars
formed
line
for
roll
call
kept
things
in
order
groomed
their
horses
polished
their
arms
brought
in
straw
from
the
thatched
roofs
in
place
of
fodder
and
sat
down
to
dine
round
the
caldrons
from
which
they
rose
up
hungry
joking
about
their
nasty
food
and
their
hunger
.
as
usual
in
their
spare
time
they
lit
bonfires
steamed
themselves
before
them
naked
smoked
picked
out
and
baked
sprouting
rot
ten
potatoes
told
and
listened
to
stories
of
po
tdmkins
and
suv6rovs
campaigns
or
to
leg
ends
of
alesha
the
sly
or
the
priests
laborer
mik61ka
.
the
officers
as
usual
lived
in
twos
and
threes
in
the
roofless
halfruined
houses
.
the
seniors
tried
to
collect
straw
and
potatoes
and
in
gen
eral
food
for
the
men
.
the
younger
ones
oc
cupied
themselves
as
before
some
playing
cards
there
was
plenty
of
money
though
there
was
no
food
some
with
more
innocent
games
such
as
quoits
and
skittles
.
the
general
trend
of
the
campaign
was
rarely
spoken
of
partly
be
cause
nothing
certain
was
known
about
it
partly
because
there
was
a
vague
feeling
that
in
the
main
it
was
going
badly
.
rost6v
lived
as
before
with
denfsov
and
since
their
furlough
they
had
become
more
friendly
than
ever
.
denisov
never
spoke
of
ros
tovs
family
but
by
the
tender
friendship
his
commander
showed
him
rost6v
felt
that
the
elder
hussars
luckless
love
for
natdsha
played
a
part
in
strengthening
their
friendship
.
den
fsov
evidently
tried
to
expose
rost6v
to
dan
ger
as
seldom
as
possible
and
after
an
action
greeted
his
safe
return
with
evident
joy
.
on
one
of
his
foraging
expeditions
in
a
deserted
and
ruined
village
to
which
he
had
come
in
search
of
provisions
rost6v
found
a
family
consisting
of
an
old
pole
and
his
daughter
with
an
infant
in
arms
.
they
were
half
clad
hungry
too
weak
to
get
away
on
foot
and
had
no
means
of
obtaining
a
conveyance
.
rost6v
brought
them
to
his
quarters
placed
them
in
his
own
lodging
and
kept
them
for
some
weeks
while
the
old
man
was
recovering
.
one
of
his
com
rades
talking
of
women
began
chaffing
ros
t6v
saying
that
he
was
more
wily
than
any
of
them
and
that
it
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
if
he
introduced
to
them
the
pretty
polish
girl
he
had
saved
.
rost6v
took
the
joke
as
an
insult
book

flared
up
and
said
such
unpleasant
things
to
the
officer
that
it
was
all
denfsov
could
do
to
prevent

denfsov

did

denisov
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
and
be
gan
rapidly
pacing
the
room
without
looking
at
rostov
as
was
his
way
at
moments
of
deep
feeling
.
ah
what
a
mad
bweed
you
wostovs
are
he
muttered
and
rost6v
noticed
tears
in
his
eyes
.
chapter
xvi
in
april
the
troops
were
enlivened
by
news
of
the
emperors
arrival
but
rost6v
had
no
chance
of
being
present
at
the
review
he
held
at
bartenstein
as
the
pavlograds
were
at
the
outposts
far
beyond
that
place
.
they
were
bivouacking
.
denisov
and
ros
t6v
were
living
in
an
earth
hut
dug
out
for
them
by
the
soldiers
and
roofed
with
branches
and
turf
.
the
hut
was
made
in
the
following
manner
which
had
then
come
into
vogue
.
a
trench
was
dug
three
and
a
half
feet
wide
four
feet
eight
inches
deep
and
eight
feet
long
.
at
one
end
of
the
trench
steps
were
cut
out
and
these
formed
the
entrance
and
vestibule
.
the
trench
itself
was
the
room
in
which
the
lucky
ones
such
as
the
squadron
commander
had
a
board
lying
on
piles
at
the
end
opposite
the
entrance
to
serve
as
a
table
.
on
each
side
of
the
trench
the
earth
was
cut
out
to
a
breadth
of
about
two
and
a
half
feet
and
this
did
duty
for
bedsteads
and
couches
.
the
roof
was
so
constructed
that
one
could
stand
up
in
the
mid
dle
of
the
trench
and
could
even
sit
up
on
the
beds
if
one
drew
close
to
the
table
.
denfsov
who
was
living
luxuriously
because
the
sol
diers
of
his
squadron
liked
him
had
also
a
board
in
the
roof
at
the
farther
end
with
a
piece
of
broken
but
mended
glass
in
it
for
a
window
.
when
it
was
very
cold
embers
from
the
soldiers
campfire
were
placed
on
a
bent
sheet
of
iron
on
the
steps
in
the
reception
room
as
denfsov
called
that
part
of
the
hut
and
it
was
then
so
warm
that
the
officers
of
whom
there
were
always
some
with
denfsov
and
rost6v
sat
in
their
shirt
sleeves
.
in
april
rost6v
was
on
orderly
duty
.
one
morning
between
seven
and
eight
returning
after
a
sleepless
night
he
sent
for
embers
changed
his
rainsoaked
underclothes
said
his
prayers
drank
tea
got
warm
then
tidied
up
the
things
on
the
table
and
in
his
own
corner
and
his
face
glowing
from
exposure
to
the
wind
and
with
nothing
on
but
his
shirt
lay
down
on
his
back
putting
his
arms
under
his
head
.
he
was
pleasantly
considering
the
prob
ability
of
being
promoted
in
a
few
days
for
his
last
reconnoitering
expedition
and
was
await
ing
denisov
who
had
gone
out
somewhere
and
with
whom
he
wanted
a
talk
.
suddenly
he
heard
denisov
shouting
in
a
vi
brating
voice
behind
the
hut
evidently
much
excited
.
rost6v
moved
to
the
window
to
see
whom
he
was
speaking
to
and
saw
the
quarter
master
topcheenko
.
i
ordered
you
not
to
let
them
eat
that
mash
ka
woot
stuff
denisov
was
shouting
.
and
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
how
lazarchuk
bwought
some
fwom
the
fields
.
i
have
given
the
order
again
and
again
your
honor
but
they
dont
obey
answered
the
quartermaster
.
rost6v
lay
down
again
on
his
bed
and
thought
complacently
let
him
fuss
and
bus
tle
now
my
jobs
done
and
im
lying
down
capitally
he
could
hear
that
lavrushka
that
sly
bold
orderly
of
denisovs
was
talking
as
well
as
the
quartermaster
.
lavrushka
was
saying
something
about
loaded
wagons
bis
cuits
and
oxen
he
had
seen
when
he
had
gone
out
for
provisions
.
then
denisovs
voice
was
heard
shouting
farther
and
farther
away
.
saddle
second
pla
toon
where
are
they
off
to
now
thought
ros
t6v
.
five
minutes
later
denfsov
came
into
the
hut
climbed
with
muddy
boots
on
the
bed
lit
his
pipe
furiously
scattered
his
things
about
took
his
leaded
whip
buckled
on
his
saber
and
went
out
again
.
in
answer
to
ros
t6vs
inquiry
where
he
was
going
he
answered
vaguely
and
crossly
that
he
had
some
business
.
let
god
and
our
gweat
monarch
judge
me
afterwards
said
denfsov
going
out
and
ros
t6v
heard
the
hoofs
of
several
horses
splashing
through
the
mud
.
he
did
not

even
trouble
to
find
out
where
denfsov
had
gone
.
having
got
warm
in
his
corner
he
fell
asleep
and
did
not
leave
the
hut
till
toward
evening
.
denfsov
had
not
yet
returned
.
the
weather
had
cleared
up
and
near
the
next
hut
two
officers
and
a
cadet
were
playing
svdyka
laughing
as
they
threw
their
missiles
which
buried
themselves
in
the
224
war
and
peace
soft
mud
.
rostdv
joined
them
.
in
the
middle
of
the
game
the
officers
saw
some
wagons
ap
proaching
with
fifteen
hussars
on
their
skinny
horses
behind
them
.
the
wagons
escorted
by
the
hussars
drew
up
to
the
picket
ropes
and
a
crowd
of
hussars
surrounded
them
.
there
now
denfsov
has
been
worrying
said
rost6v
and
here
are
the
provisions
.
so
they
are
said
the
officers
.
wont
the
soldiers
be
glad
a
little
behind
the
hussars
came
denfsov
accompanied
by
two
infantry
officers
with
whom
he
was
talking
.
rost6v
went
to
meet
them
.
i
warn
you
captain
one
of
the
officers
a
short
thin
man
evidently
very
angry
was
say
ing
.

i
wont
give
them

replied
denfsov
.

days
.
and

weeks
said
denfsov
.
it
is
robbery
youll
answer
for
it
sir
said
the
infantry
officer
raising
his
voice
.
now
what
are
you
pestewing
me
for
cried
denfsov
suddenly
losing
his
temper
.
i
shall
answer
for
it
and
not
you
and
youd
bet
ter
not
buzz
about
here
till
you
get
hurt
.
be
off
i
go
he
shouted
at
the
officers
.
very
well
then
shouted
the
little
officer
undaunted
and
not
riding
away
.
if
you
are
determined
to
rob
ill

.

.

.
go
to
the
devil
quick
mach
while
youre
safe
and
sound
and
denfsov
turned
his
horse
on
the
officer
.
very
well
very
well
muttered
the
officer
threateningly
and
turning
his
horse
he
trotted
away
jolting
in
his
saddle
.
a
dog
astwide
a
fence
a
weal
dog
astwide
a
fence
shouted
denfsov
after
him
the
most
insulting
expression
a
cavalryman
can
address
to
a
mounted
infantryman
and
riding
up
to
rost6v
he
burst
out
laughing
.
ive
taken
twansports
from
the
infantwy
by
force
he
said
.
after
all
cant
let
our
men
starve
.
the
wagons
that
had
reached
the
hussars
had
been
consigned
to
an
infantry
regiment
but
learning
from
la
vnishka
that
the
transport
was
unescorted
denfsov
with
his
hussars
had
seized
it
by
force
.
the
soldiers
had
biscuits
dealt
out
to
them
freely
and
they
even
shared
them
with
the
other
squadrons
.
the
next
day
the
regimental
commander
sent
for
denfsov
and
holding
his
fingers
spread
out
before
his
eyes
said
this
is
howl
look
at
thisaffair
i
know
noth
ing
about
it
and
wont
begin
proceedings
but
i
advise
you
to
ride
over
to
the
staff
and
settle
the
business
there
in
the
commissariat
depart
ment
and
if
possible
sign
a
receipt
forsuch
and
such
stores
received
.
if
not
as
the
demand
was
booked
against
an
infantry
regiment
there
will
be
a
row
and
the
affair
may
end
badly
.
from
the
regimental
commanders
denfsov
rode
straight
to
the
staff
with
a
sincere
desire
to
act
on
this
advice
.
in
the
evening
he
came
back
to
his
dugout
in
a
state
such
as
rostov
had
never
yet
seen
him
in
.
denfsov
could
not
speak
and
gasped
for
breath
.
when
rostov
asked
what
was
the
matter
he
only
uttered
some
incoherent
oaths
and
threats
in
a
hoarse
feeble
voice
.
alarmed
at
denfsovs
condition
rost6v
sug
gested
that
he
should
undress
drink
some
wa
ter
and
send
for
the
doctor
.

.

.
he
muttered
.
the
regimental
doctor
when
he
came
said
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
bleed
denfsov
.
a
deep
saucer
of
black
blood
was
taken
from
his
hairy
arm
and
only
then
was
he
able
to
relate
what
had
happened
to
him
.
i

began
denfsov
.

.

.

shouted
denfsov
hitting
the
table
with
the
fist
of
his
newly
bled
arm
so
violently
that
the
table
near
ly
broke
down
and
the
tumblers
on
it
jumped
about
.

.

.well
ive

cried
denfsov
gleeful
and
yet
angry
his
white
book
five
225
teeth
showing
under
his
black
mustache
.
id
have
killed
him
if
they
hadnt
taken
him
awayl
but
what
are
you
shouting
for
calm
your
self
said
rost6v
.
youve
set
your
arm
bleed
ing
afresh
.
wait
we
must
tie
it
up
again
.
denisov
was
bandaged
up
again
and
put
to
bed
.
next
day
he
woke
calm
and
cheerful
.
but
at
noon
the
adjutant
of
the
regiment
came
into
rost6vs
and
denfsovs
dugout
with
a
grave
and
serious
face
and
regretfully
showed
them
a
paper
addressed
to
major
denfsov
from
the
regimental
commander
in
which
inquiries
were
made
about
yesterdays
occurrence
.
the
adjutant
told
them
that
the
affair
was
likely
to
take
a
very
bad
turn
that
a
courtmartial
had
been
appointed
and
that
in
view
of
the
severity
with
which
marauding
and
insubordi
nation
were
now
regarded
degradation
to
the
ranks
would
be
the
best
that
could
be
hoped
for
.
the
case
as
represented
by
the
offended
par
ties
was
that
after
seizing
the
transports
ma
jor
denisov
being
drunk
went
to
the
chief
quartermaster
and
without
any
provocation
called
him
a
thief
threatened
to
strike
him
and
on
being
led
out
had
rushed
into
the
office
and
given
two
officials
a
thrashing
and
dislo
cated
the
arm
of
one
of
them
.
in
answer
to
rost6vs
renewed
questions
denfsov
said
laughing
that
he
thought
he
re
membered
that
some
other
fellow
had
got
mixed
up
in
it
but
that
it
was
all
nonsense
and
rubbish
and
he
did
not
in
the
least
fear
any
kind
of
trial
and
that
if
those
scoundrels
dared
attack
him
he
would
give
them
an
answer
that
they
would
not
easily
forget
.
denfsov
spoke
contemptuously
of
the
whole
matter
but
rost6v
knew
him
too
well
not
to
detect
that
while
hiding
it
from
others
at
heart
he
feared
a
courtmartial
and
was
wor
ried
over
the
affair
which
was
evidently
tak
ing
a
bad
turn
.
every
day
letters
of
inquiry
and
notices
from
the
court
arrived
and
on
the
first
of
may
denfsov
was
ordered
to
hand
the
squadron
over
to
the
next
in
seniority
and
ap
pear
before
the
staff
of
his
division
to
explain
his
violence
at
the
commissariat
office
.
on
the
previous
day
pldtov
reconnoitered
with
two
cossack
regiments
and
two
squadrons
of
hus
sars
.
denisov
as
was
his
wont
rode
out
in
front
of
the
outposts
parading
his
courage
.
a
bullet
fired
by
a
french
sharpshooter
hit
him
in
the
fleshy
part
of
his
leg
.
perhaps
at
another
time
denfsov
would
not
have
left
the
regiment
for
so
slight
a
wound
but
now
he
took
advantage
of
it
to
excuse
himself
from
appearing
at
the
staff
and
went
into
hospital
.
chapter
xvii
in
june
the
battle
of
friedland
was
fought
in
which
the
pavlograds
did
not
take
part
and
after
that
an
armistice
was
proclaimed
.
rost6v
who
felt
his
friends
absence
very
much
having
no
news
of
him
since
he
left
and
feeling
very
anxious
about
his
wound
and
the
progress
of
his
affairs
took
advantage
of
the
armistice
to
get
leave
to
visit
denfsov
in
hospital
.
the
hospital
was
in
a
small
prussian
town
that
had
been
twice
devastated
by
russian
and
french
troops
.
because
it
was
summer
when
it
is
so
beautiful
out
in
the
fields
the
little
town
presented
a
particularly
dismal
appearance
with
its
broken
roofs
and
fences
its
foul
streets
tattered
inhabitants
and
the
sick
and
drunken
soldiers
wandering
about
.
the
hospital
was
in
a
brick
building
with
some
of
the
window
frames
and
panes
broken
and
a
courtyard
surrounded
by
the
remains
of
a
wooden
fence
that
had
been
pulled
to
pieces
.
several
bandaged
soldiers
with
pale
swollen
faces
were
sitting
or
walking
about
in
the
sun
shine
in
the
yard
.
directly
rost6v
entered
the
door
he
was
en
veloped
by
a
smell
of
putrefaction
and
hospital
air
.
on
the
stairs
he
met
a
russian
army
doc
tor
smoking
a
cigar
.
the
doctor
was
followed
by
a
russian
assistant
.
i
cant
tear
myself
to
pieces
the
doctor
was
saying
.
come
to
makar
alexeevich
in
the
eve
ning
.
i
shall
be
there
.
the
assistant
asked
some
further
questions
.
oh
do
the
best
you
can
isnt
it
all
the
same
the
doctor
noticed
rost6v
coming
up
stairs
.
what
do
you
want
sir
said
the
doctor
.
what
do
you
want
the
bullets
having
spared
you
do
you
want
to
try
typhus
this
is
a
pest
house
sir
.
how
so
asked
rost6v
.
typhus

.

to
go
in
.
only

two
makev
and
i
he
pointed
to
the
assist
ant
keep
on
here
.
some
five
of
us
doctors
have
died
in
this
place
.

.

.

.
when
a
new
one
comes
he
is
done
for
in
a
week
said
the
doc
tor
with
evident
satisfaction
.
prussian
doctors
have
been
invited
here
but
our
allies
dont
like
it
at
all
.
rost6v
explained
that
he
wanted
to
see
ma
jor
denfsov
of
the
hussars
who
was
wounded
.
i
dont
know
.
i
cant
tell
you
sir
.
only
think
i
am
alone
in
charge
of
three
hospitals
226
war
and
peace
with
more
than
four
hundred
patients
its
well
that
the
charitable
prussian
ladies
send
us
two
pounds
of
coffee
and
some
lint
each
month
or
we
should
be
lost
he
laughed
.
four
hun
dred
sir
and
theyre
always
sending
me
fresh
ones
.
there
are
four
hundred
eh
he
asked
turning
to
the
assistant
.
the
assistant
looked
fagged
out
.
he
was
evi
dently
vexed
and
impatient
for
the
talkative
doctor
to
go
.
major
denisov
rost6v
said
again
.
he
was
wounded
at
molliten
.
dead
i
fancy
.
eh
makev
queried
the
doctor
in
a
tone
of
indifference
.
the
assistant
however
did
not
confirm
the
doctors
words
.
is
he
tall
and
with
reddish
hair
asked
the
doctor
.
rost6v
described
denisovs
appearance
.
there
was
one
like
that
said
the
doctor
as
if
pleased
.
that
one
is
dead
i
fancy
.
how
ever
ill
look
up
our
list
.
we
had
a
list
.
have
you
got
it
makev
makir
alextfevich
has
the
list
answered
the
assistant
.
but
if
youll
step
into
the
officers
wards
youll
see
for
yourself
he
added
turn
ing
to
rostov
.
ah
youd
better
not
go
sir
said
the
doc
tor
or
you
may
have
to
stay
here
yourself
.
but
rost6v
bowed
himself
away
from
the
doctor
and
asked
the
assistant
to
show
him
the
way
.
only
dont
blame
me
the
doctor
shouted
up
after
him
.
rost6v
and
the
assistant
went
into
the
dark
corridor
.
the
smell
was
so
strong
there
that
rost6v
held
his
nose
and
had
to
pause
and
collect
his
strength
before
he
could
go
on
.
a
door
opened
to
the
right
and
an
emaciated
sallow
man
on
crutches
barefoot
and
in
un
derclothing
limped
out
and
leaning
against
the
doorpost
looked
with
glittering
envious
eyes
at
those
who
were
passing
.
glancing
in
at
the
doorrost6v
saw
that
the
sick
and
wounded
were
lying
on
the
floor
on
straw
and
overcoats
.
may
i
go
in
and
look
what
is
there
to
see
said
the
assistant
.
but
just
because
the
assistant
evidently
did
not
want
him
to
go
in
rost6v
entered
the
sol
diers
ward
.
the
foul
air
to
which
he
had
al
ready
begun
to
get
used
in
the
corridor
was
still
stronger
here
.
it
was
a
little
different
more
pungent
and
one
felt
that
this
was
where
it
originated
.
in
the
long
room
brightly
lit
up
by
the
sun
through
the
large
windows
the
sick
and
wound
ed
lay
in
two
rows
with
their
heads
to
the
walls
and
leaving
a
passage
in
the
middle
.
most
of
them
were
unconscious
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
newcomers
.
those
who
were
conscious
raised
themselves
or
lifted
their
thin
yellow
faces
and
all
looked
intently
at
rost6v
with
the
same
expression
of
hope
of
relief
re
proach
and
envy
of
anothers
health
.
rost6v
went
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
looking
through
the
open
doors
into
the
two
adjoining
rooms
saw
the
same
thing
there
.
he
stood
still
looking
silently
around
.
he
had
not
at
all
ex
pected
such
a
sight
.
just
before
him
almost
across
the
middle
of
the
passage
on
the
bare
floor
lay
a
sick
man
probably
a
cossack
to
judge
by
the
cut
of
his
hair
.
the
man
lay
on
his
back
his
huge
arms
and
legs
outstretched
.
his
face
was
purple
his
eyes
were
rolled
back
so
that
only
the
whites
were
seen
and
on
his
bare
legs
and
arms
which
were
still
red
the
veins
stood
out
like
cords
.
he
was
knocking
the
back
of
his
head
against
the
floor
hoarsely
uttering
some
word
which
he
kept
repeating
.
rost6v
listened
and
made
out
the
word
.
it
was
drink
drink
a
drinkl
rost6v
glanced
round
looking
for
someone
who
would
put
this
man
back
in
his
place
and
bring
him
wa
ter
.
who
looks
after
the
sick
here
he
asked
the
assistant
.
just
then
a
commissariat
soldier
a
hospital
orderly
came
in
from
the
next
room
march
ing
stiffly
and
drew
up
in
front
of
rost6v
.
good
day
your
honor
he
shouted
roll
ing
his
eyes
at
rostov
and
evidently
mistaking
him
for
one
of
the
hospital
authorities
.
get
him
to
his
place
and
give
him
some
water
said
rost6v
pointing
to
the
cossack
.
yes
your
honor
the
soldier
replied
com
placently
and
rolling
his
eyes
more
than
ever
he
drew
himself
up
still
straighter
but
did
not
move
.
no
its
impossible
to
do
anything
here
thought
rost6v
lowering
his
eyes
and
he
was
going
out
but
became
aware
of
an
intense
look
fixed
on
him
on
his
right
and
he
turned
.
close
to
the
corner
on
an
overcoat
sat
an
old
un
shaven
graybearded
soldier
as
thin
as
a
skele
ton
with
a
stern
sallow
face
and
eyes
intently
fixed
on
rost6v
.
the
mans
neighbor
on
one
side
whispered
something
to
him
pointing
at
rost6v
who
noticed
that
the
old
man
wanted
to
speak
to
him
.
he
drew
nearer
and
saw
that
the
old
man
had
only
one
leg
bent
under
him
the
other
had
been
amputated
above
the
knee
.
his
neighbor
on
the
other
side
who
lay
mo
book
tionless
some
distance
from
him
with
his
head
thrown
back
was
a
young
soldier
with
a
snub
nose
.
his
pale
waxen
face
was
still
freckled
and
his
eyes
were
rolled
back
.
rost6v
looked
at
the
young
soldier
and
a
cold
chill
ran
down
his
back
.
why
this
one
seems

.

.

.
he
began
turning
to
the
assistant
.
and
how
weve
been
begging
your
honor
said
the
old
soldier
his
jaw
quivering
.
hes
been
dead
since
morning
.
after
all
were
men
not
dogs
.
ill
send
someone
at

.
he
shall

taken
a

said
the
assistant
hurriedly
.
let
us
go
your
honor
.
yes
yes
let
us
go
said
rost6v
hastily
and
lowering
his
eyes
and
shrinking
he
tried
to
pass
unnoticed
between
the
rows
of
reproach
ful
envious
eyes
that
were
fixed
upon
him
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
chapter
xviii
going
along
the
corridor
the
assistant
led
rost6v
to
the
officers
wards
consisting
of
three
rooms
the
doors
of
which
stood
open
.
there
were
beds
in
these
rooms
and
the
sick
and
wounded
officers
were
lying
or
sitting
on
them
.
some
were
walking
about
the
rooms
in
hospital
dressing
gowns
.
the
first
person
rostov
met
in
the
officers
ward
was
a
thin
little
man
with
one
arm
who
was
walking
about
the
first
room
in
a
nightcap
and
hospital
dressing
gown
with
a
pipe
between
his
teeth
.
rost6v
looked
at
him
trying
to
remember
where
he
had
seen
him
be
fore
.
see
where
weve
met
again
i
said
the
little
man
.
tushin
tiishin
dont
you
remember
who
gave
you
a
lift
at
schon
grabern
and
ive
had
a
bit
cut
off
you

.

.

.
he
went
on
with
a
smile
pointing
to
the
empty
sleeve
of
his
dressing
gown
.
looking
for
vasili
dmft
rich
denfsov
my
neighbor
he
added
when
he
heard
who
rost6v
wanted
.
here
here
and
tiishin
led
him
into
the
next
room
from
whence
came
sounds
of
several
laughing
voices
.
how
can
they
laugh
or
even
live
at
all
here
thought
rost6v
still
aware
of
that
smell
of
decomposing
flesh
that
had
been
so
strong
in
the
soldiers
ward
and
still
seeming
to
see
fixed
on
him
those
envious
looks
which
had
followed
him
out
from
both
sides
and
the
face
of
that
young
soldier
with
eyes
rolled
back
.
denfsov
lay
asleep
on
his
bed
with
his
head
under
the
blanket
though
it
was
nearly
noon
.
ah
wost6v
how
are
you
how
are
you
five
227
he
called
out
still
in
the
same
voice
as
in
the
regiment
but
rost6v
noticed
sadly
that
under
this
habitual
ease
and
animation
some
new
sinister
hidden
feeling
showed
itself
in
the
expression
of
denfsovs
face
and
the
intona
tions
of
his
voice
.
his
wound
though
a
slight
one
had
not
yet
healed
even
now
six
weeks
after
he
had
been
hit
.
his
face
had
the
same
swollen
pallor
as
the
faces
of
the
other
hospital
patients
but
it
was
not
this
that
struck
rostov
.
what
struck
him
was
that
denfsov
did
not
seem
glad
to
see
him
and
smiled
at
him
unnaturally
.
he
did
not
ask
about
the
regiment
nor
about
the
general
state
of
affairs
and
when
rost6v
spoke
of
these
matters
did
not
listen
.
rostov
even
noticed
that
denfsov
did
not
like
to
be
reminded
of
the
regiment
or
in
gen
eral
of
that
other
free
life
which
was
going
on
outside
the
hospital
.
he
seemed
to
try
to
for
get
that
old
life
and
was
only
interested
in
the
affair
with
the
commissariat
officers
.
on
ros
t6vs
inquiry
as
to
how
the
matter
stood
he
at
once
produced
from
under
his
pillow
a
paper
he
had
received
from
the
commission
and
the
rough
draft
of
his
answer
to
it
.
he
became
ani
mated
when
he
began
reading
his
paper
and
specially
drew
rostovs
attention
to
the
sting
ing
rejoinders
he
made
to
his
enemies
.
his
hospital
companions
who
had
gathered
round
rost6v
a
fresh
arrival
from
the
world
outside
gradually
began
to
disperse
as
soon
as
denf
sov
began
reading
his
answer
.
rost6v
noticed
by
their
faces
that
all
those
gentlemen
had
al
ready
heard
that
story
more
than
once
and
were
tired
of
it
.
only
the
man
who
had
the
next
bed
a
stout
uhlan
continued
to
sit
on
his
bed
gloomily
frowning
and
smoking
a
pipe
and
little
onearmed
tiishin
still
lis
tened
shaking
his
head
disapprovingly
.
in
the
middle
of
the
reading
the
uhlan
interrupted
denisov
.
but
what
i
say
is
he
said
turning
to
ros
t6v
it
would
be
best
simply
to
petition
the
emperor
for
pardon
.
they
say
great
rewards
will
now
be
distributed
and
surely
a
pardon
would
be
granted
.

denf
sov
in
a
voice
to
which
he
tried
hard
to
give
the
old
energy
and
fire
but
which
sounded
like
an
expression
of
irritable
impotence

denfsov
interrupted
him
and
went
on
read
ing
his
paper
.
rostov
had
not
the
courage
to
persuade
denisov
though
he
instinctively
felt
that
the
way
advised
by
tiishin
and
the
other
officers
was
the
safest
and
though
he
would
have
been
glad
to
be
of
service
to
denisov
.
he
knew
his
stubborn
will
and
straightforward
hasty
tem
mr
.

when
the
reading
of
denisovs
virulent
re
ply
which
took
more
than
an
hour
was
over
rost6v
said
nothing
and
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
a
most
dejected
state
of
mind
amid
denisovs
hospital
comrades
who
had
gathered
round
him
telling
them
what
he
knew
and
lis
tening
to
their
stories
.
denisov
was
moodily
silent
all
the
evening
.
late
in
the
evening
when
rost6v
was
about
to
leave
he
asked
denisov
whether
he
had
no
commission
for
him
.
yes
wait
a
bit
said
denisov
glancing
round
at
the
officers
and
taking
his
papers
from
under
his
pillow
he
went
to
the
window
where
he
had
an
inkpot
and
sat
down
to
write
.
it

its
no

knocking

he
said
coming
from
the
win
dow
and
giving
rost6v
a
large
envelope
.
in
it
was
the
petition
to
the
emperor
drawn
up
by
the
auditor
in
which
denisov
without
allud

to
the
offenses
of

simply
asked
for

he
did
not
finish
but
gave
a
painfully
un
natural
smile
.
chapter
xix
having
returned
to
the
regiment
and
told
the
commander
the
state
of
denisovs
affairs
rost6v
rode
to
tilsit
with
the
letter
to
the
emperor
.
on
the
thirteenth
of
june
the
french
and
russian
emperors
arrived
in
tilsit
.
boris
dru
betsk6y
had
asked
the
important
personage
on
whom
he
was
in
attendance
to
include
him
in
the
suite
appointed
for
the
stay
at
tilsit
.
i
should
like
to
see
the
great
man
he
said
alluding
to
napoleon
whom
hitherto
he
like
everyone
else
had
always
called
buonaparte
.
you
are
speaking
of
buonaparte
asked
the
general
smiling
.
boris
looked
at
his
general
inquiringly
and
immediately
saw
that
he
was
being
tested
.
i
am
speaking
prince
of
the
emperor
na
poleon
he
replied
.
the
general
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
with
a
smile
.
you
will
go
far
he
said
and
took
him
to
tilsit
with
him
.
boris
was
among
the
few
present
at
the
nie
men
on
the
day
the
two
emperors
met
.
he
saw
the
raft
decorated
with
monograms
saw
napo
leon
pass
before
the
french
guards
on
the
farther
bank
of
the
river
saw
the
pensive
face
of
the
emperor
alexander
as
he
sat
in
silence
in
a
tavern
on
the
bank
of
the
niemen
await
ing
napoleons
arrival
saw
both
emperors
get
into
boats
and
saw
how
napoleon
reaching
the
raft
first
stepped
quickly
forward
to
meet
alexander
and
held
out
his
hand
to
him
arid
how
they
both
retired
into
the
pavilion
.
since
he
had
begun
to
move
in
the
highest
circles
boris
had
made
it
his
habit
to
watch
attentive
ly
all
that
went
on
around
him
and
to
note
it
down
.
at
the
time
of
the
meeting
at
tilsit
he
asked
the
names
of
those
who
had
come
with
napoleon
and
about
the
uniforms
they
wore
and
listened
attentively
to
words
spoken
by
im
portant
personages
.
at
the
moment
the
em
perors
went
into
the
pavilion
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
did
not
forget
to
look
at
it
again
when
alexander
came
out
.
the
interview
had
lasted
an
hour
and
fiftythree
minutes
.
he
noted
this
down
that
same
evening
among
oth
er
facts
he
felt
to
be
of
historic
importance
.
as
the
emperors
suite
was
a
very
small
one
it
was
a
matter
of
great
importance
for
a
man
who
valued
his
success
in
the
service
to
be
at
tilsit
on
the
occasion
of
this
interview
between
the
two
emperors
and
having
succeeded
in
this
boris
felt
that
henceforth
his
position
was
ful
ly
assured
.
he
had
not
only
become
known
but
people
had
grown
accustomed
to
him
and
accepted
him
.
twice
he
had
executed
commis
sions
to
the
emperor
himself
so
that
the
latter
knew
his
face
and
all
those
at
court
far
from
coldshouldering
him
as
at
first
when
they
con
sidered
him
a
newcomer

surprised
had
he
been
absent
.
borfs
lodged
with
another
adjutant
the
pol
ish
count
zhilinski
.
zhilinski
a
pole
brought
up
in
paris
was
rich
and
passionately
fond
of
the
french
and
almost
every
day
of
the
stay
at
tilsit
french
officers
of
the
guard
and
from
french
headquarters
were
dining
and
lunch
ing
with
him
and
boris
.
on
the
evening
of
the
twentyfourth
of
june
count
zhilfnski
arranged
a
supper
for
his
french
friends
.
the
guest
of
honor
was
an
aide
decamp
of
napoleons
there
were
also
several
french
officers
of
the
guard
and
a
page
of
na
poleons
a
young
lad
of
an
old
aristocratic
french
family
.
that
same
day
rost6v
profit
ing
by
the
darkness
to
avoid
being
recognized
in
civilian
dress
came
to
tilsit
and
went
to
the
lodging
occupied
by
borfs
and
zhilinski
.
rostov
in
common
with
the
whole
army
from
which
he
came
was
far
from
having
ex
perienced
the
change
of
feeling
toward
napo
leon
and
the
french
who
from
being
foes
had
suddenly
become
friends
that
had
taken
place
at
headquarters
and
in
boris
.
in
the
army
bon
aparte
and
the
french
were
still
regarded
with
mingled
feelings
of
anger
contempt
and
fear
.
only
recently
talkingwith
one
of
plltovs
cos
sack
officers
rost6v
had
argued
that
if
napole
on
were
taken
prisoner
he
would
be
treated
not
as
a
sovereign
but
as
a
criminal
.
quite
lately
happening
to
meet
a
wounded
french
colonel
on
the
road
rost6v
had
maintained
with
heat
that
peace
was
impossible
between
a
legitimate
sovereign
and
the
criminal
bonaparte
.
rost6v
was
therefore
unpleasantly
struck
by
the
pres
ence
of
french
officers
in
boris
lodging
dressed
in
uniforms
he
had
been
accustomed
to
see
from
quite
a
different
point
of
view
from
the
outposts
of
the
flank
.
as
soon
as
he
noticed
a
french
officer
who
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
door
that
warlike
feeling
of
hostility
which
he
always
experienced
at
the
sight
of
the
enemy
suddenly
seized
him
.
he
stopped
at
the
thresh
old
and
asked
in
russian
whether
drubetsk6y
lived
there
.
boris
hearing
a
strange
voice
in
the
anteroom
came
out
to
meet
him
.
an
ex
pression
of
annoyance
showed
itself
for
a
mo
ment
on
his
face
on
first
recognizing
rost6v
.
ah
its
you
very
glad
very
glad
to
see
you
he
said
however
coming
toward
him
with
a
smile
.
but
rost6v
had
noticed
his
first
impulse
.
ive
come
at
a
bad
time
i
think
.
i
should
not
have
come
but
i
have
business
he
said
coldly
.
no
i
only
wonder
how
you
managed
to
get
away
from
your
regiment
.

he
said
answering
someone
who
called
him

rost6v
repeated
.
the
look
of
annoyance
had
already
disap
peared
from
borfs
face
having
evidently
re
flected
and
decided
how
to
act
he
very
quiet
ly
took
both
rost6vs
hands
and
led
him
into
the
next
room
.
his
eyes
looking
serenely
and
steadily
at
rost6v
seemed
to
be
veiled
by
some
thing
as
if
screened
by
blue
spectacles
of
con
ventionality
.
so
it
seemed
to
rost6v
.
oh
come
now
as
if
you
could
come
at
a
wrong
time
said
boris
and
he
led
him
into
the
room
where
the
supper
table
was
laid
and
introduced
him
to
his
guests
explaining
that
he
was
not
a
civilian
but
an
hussar
officer
and
an
old
friend
of
his

said
he
naming
his
guests
.
rost6v
looked
frowningly
at
the
frenchmen
bowed
reluctantly
and
remained
silent
.
zhilinski
evidently
did
not
receive
this
new
russian
person
very
willingly
into
his
circle
and
did
not
speak
to
rost6v
.
boris
did
not
ap
pear
to
notice
the
constraint
the
newcomer
produced
and
with
the
same
pleasant
compo
sure
and
the
same
veiled
look
in
his
eyes
with
which
he
had
met
rost6v
tried
to
enliven
the
conversation
.
one
of
the
frenchmen
with
the
politeness
characteristic
of
his
countrymen
ad
dressed
the
obstinately
taciturn
rost6v
say
ing
that
the
latter
had
probably
come
to
tilsit
to
see
the
emperor
.
no

came

replied
rostov
briefly
.
rostov
had
been
out
of
humor
from
the
mo
ment
he
noticed
the
look
of
dissatisfaction
on
boris
face
and
as
always
happens
to
those
in
a
bad
humor
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
regarded
him
with
aversion
and
that
he
was
in
everybodys
way
.
he
really
was
in
their
way
for
he
alone
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
which
again
became
general
.
the
looks
the
visitors
cast
on
him
seemed
to
say
and
what
is
he
sitting
here
for
he
rose
and
went
up
to
borfs
.
anyhow
im
in
your
way
he
said
in
a
low
tone
.
corrie
and
talk
over
my
business
and
ill
go
away
.
oh
no
not
at
all
said
borfs
.
but
if
you
are
tired
come
and
lie
down
in
my
room
and
have
a
rest
.
yes
really

.

.

.
they
went
into
the
little
room
where
boris
slept

once
irritably
as
if
boris
were
to
blame
in
some
way
telling
him
about
denisovs
affair
asking
him
whether
through
his
general
he
could
and
would
intercede
with
the
emperor
on
denisovs
behalf
and
get
denisovs
petition
handed
in
.
when
he
and
boris
were
alone
ros
t6v
felt
for
the
first
time
that
he
could
not
look
boris
in
the
face
without
a
sense
of
awkward
ness
.
boris
with
one
leg
crossed
over
the
other
and
stroking
his
left
hand
with
the
slender
fin
gers
of
his
right
listened
to
rost6v
as
a
general
listens
to
the
report
of
a
subordinate
now
look
ing
aside
and
now
gazing
straight
into
rost6vs
eyes
with
the
same
veiled
look
.
each
time
this
happened
rost6v
felt
uncomfortable
and
cast
down
his
eyes
.
i
have
heard
of
such
cases
and
know
that
his
majesty
is
very
severe
in
such
affairs
.
i
think
it
would
be
best
not
to
bring
it
before
the
emperor
but
to
apply
to
the
commander
of
the
corps
.

.

.

.
but
in
general
i
think

.

.

.
so
you
dont
want
to
do
anything
well
then
say
so
rostov
almost
shouted
not
look
ing
boris
in
the
face
.
boris
smiled
.
on
the
contrary
i
will
do
what
i
can
.
only
i
thought

.

.

.
at
that
moment
zhilfnskis
voice
was
heard
calling
boris

well
then
go
go

said
rost6v
and
refusing
supper
and
remaining
alone
in
the
little
room
he
walked
up
and
down
for
a
long
time
hearing
the
lighthearted
french
conver
sation
from
the

on

a

had
been
arranged
for

given
by
a
battalion
of
the
french
guards
to
the
preobrazhdnsk
battalion
.
the
emperors
were
to
be
present
at
that
banquet
.
rost6v
felt
so
ill
at
ease
and
uncomfortable
with
boris
that
when
the
latter
looked
in
after
supper
he
pretended
to
be
asleep
and
early
next
morning
went
away
avoiding
boris
.
in
his
civilian
clothes
and
a
round
hat
he
wandered
about
the
town
staring
at
the
french
and
their
uniforms
and
at
the
streets
and
houses
where
the
russian
and
french
emperors
were
staying
.
in
a
square
he
saw
tables
being
set
up
and
preparations
made
for
the
dinner
he
saw
the
russian
and
french
colors
draped
from
side
to

of
the
streets
with
hugh
monograms
a
and
at
.
in
the
windows
of
the
houses
also
flags
and

were
displayed

all

i
wont

here
without

not

getting
his

thought
rost6v
who
had
unconsciously
re
turned
to
the
house
where
alexander
lodged
.
saddled
horses
were
standing
before
the
house
and
the
suite
were
assembling
evidently
preparing
for
the
emperor
to
come
out

see

at

looking
at

so
much
the

and
suddenly
with
a
determination
he
himself
did
not

rost6v
felt
for

and
went
straight
to

no

rost6v
fancied
the
sovereign
saying
.
and
passing
people
who
looked
after
him
with
curiosity
he
entered
the
porch
of
the
emperors
house
.
a
broad
staircase
led
straight
up
from
the
entry
and
to
the
right
he
saw
a
closed
door
.
below
under
the
staircase
was
a
door
leading
to
the
lower
floor
.
whom

a
petition
this
way
to
the
officer
on
duty
he
was
shown
the
door
leading
downstairs
only
it
wont
be
accepted
.
on
hearing
this
indifferent
voice
rost6v
grew
frightened
at
what
he
was
doing
the
thought
of
meeting
the
emperor
at
any
mo
ment
was
so
fascinating
and
consequently
so
alarming
that
he
was
ready
to
run
away
but
the
official
who
had
questioned
him
opened
the
door
and
rost6v
entered
.
a
short
stout
man
of
about
thirty
in
white
breeches
and
high
boots
and
a
batiste
shirt
that
he
had
evidently
only
just
put
on
was
standing
in
that
room
and
his
valet
was
buttoning
on
to
the
back
of
his
breeches
a
new
pair
of
hand
some
silkembroidered
braces
that
for
some
reason
attracted
rostovs
attention
.
this
man
was
speaking
to
someone
in
the
ad
join
ing
room
.
a
good
figure
and
in
her
first
bloom
he
was
saying
but
on
seeing
rost6v
he
stopped
short
and
frowned
.
what
is
it
a
petition
what
is
it
asked
the
person
in
the
other
room
.
another
petitioner
answered
the
man
with
the
braces
.
tell
him
to
come
later
.
hell
be
coming
out
directly
we
must
go
.

later
tomorrow
.
its
too
late

rostov
turned
and
was
about
to
go
but
the
man
in
the
braces
stopped
him
.
whom
have
you
come
from
who
are
you
i
come
from
major
denisov
answered
rost6v
.
are
you
an
officer

rostov
.
what
audacity
hand
it
in
through
your
commander
.
and
go
along
with
you

.

.

.
go
and
he
continued
to
put
on
the
uniform
the
valet
handed
him
.
rost6v
went
back
into
the
hall
and
noticed
that
in
the
porch
there
were
many
officers
and
generals
in
full
parade
uniform
whom
he
had
to
pass
.
cursing
his
temerity
his
heart
sinking
at
the
thought
of
finding
himself
at
any
moment
face
to
face
with
the
emperor
and
being
put
to
shame
and
arrested
in
his
presence
fully
alive
now
to
the
impropriety
of
his
conduct
and
repenting
of
it
rost6v
with
downcast
eyes
was
making
his
way
out
of
the
house
through
the
brilliant
suite
when
a
familiar
voice
called
him
and
a
hand
detained
him
.
what
are
you
doing
here
sir
in
civilian
dress
asked
a
deep
voice
.
it
was
a
cavalry
general
who
had
obtained
the
emperors
special
favor
during
this
cam
paign
and
who
had
formerly
commanded
the
division
in
which
rost6v
was
serving
.
rost6v
in
dismay
began
justifying
himself
but
seeing
the
kindly
jocular
face
of
the
gener
al
he
took
him
aside
and
in
an
excited
voice
told
him
the
whole
affair
asking
him
to
inter
cede
for
denfsov
whom
the
general
knew
.
hav
ing
heard
rost6v
to
the
end
the
general
shook
his
head
gravely
.
im
sorry
sorry
for
that
fine
fellow
.
give
me
the
letter
.
hardly
had
rost6v
handed
him
the
letter
and
finished
explaining
denfsovs
case
when
hasty
steps
and
the
jingling
of
spurs
were
heard
on
thestairsand
thegeneral
leaving
him
went
to
the
porch
.
the
gentlemen
of
the
emperors
suite
ran
down
the
stairs
and
went
to
their
horses
.
hayne
the
same
groom
who
had
been
at
austerlitz
led
up
the
emperors
horse
and
the
faint
creak
of
a
footstep
rost6v
knew
at
once
was
heard
on
the
stairs
.
forgetting
the
danger
of
being
recognized
rostov
went
close
to
the
porch
together
with
some
inquisitive
civilians
and
again
after
two
years
saw
those
features
he
adored
that
same
face
and
same
look
and
step
and
the
same
union
of
majesty
and
mildness
.

.

.

.
and
the
feeling
of
enthusi
asm
and
love
for
his
sovereign
rose
again
in
rostovs
soul
in
all
its
old
force
.
in
the
uniform
of
the
preobrazhnsk
regiment
white
chamois
leather
breeches
and
high
boots
and
wearing
a
star
rost6v
did
not
know
it
was
that
of
the
legion
dhonneur
the
monarch
came
out
in
to
the
porch
putting
on
his
gloves
and
carry
ing
his
hat
under
his
arm
.
he
stopped
and
looked
about
him
brightening
everything
around
by
his
glance
.
he
spoke
a
few
words
to
some
of
the
generals
and
recognizing
the
for
mer
commander
of
rost6vs
division
smiled
and
beckoned
to
him
.
all
the
suite
drew
back
and
rostov
saw
the
general
talking
for
some
time
to
the
emperor
.
the
emperor
said
a
few
words
to
him
and
took
a
step
toward
his
horse
.
again
the
crowd
of
members
of
the
suite
and
street
gazers
amongwhomwas
rost6v
moved
nearer
to
the
emperor
.
stopping
beside
his
horse
with
his
hand
on
the
saddle
the
emperor
turned
to
the
cavalry
general
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
evi
dently
wishing
to
be
heard
by
all
i
cannot
do
it
general
.
i
cannot
because
the
law
is
stronger
than
i
and
he
raised
his
foot
to
the
stirrup
.
thegeneral
bowed
his
head
respectfully
and
the
monarch
mounted
and
rodedown
thestreet
war
and
peace
at
a
gallop
.
beside
himself
with
enthusiasm
rost6v
ran
after
him
with
the
crowd
.
chapter

the
emperor
rode
to
the
square
where
facing
one
another
a
battalion
of
the
preobrazhnsk
regiment
stood
on
the
right
and
a
battalion
of
the
french
guards
in
their
bearskin
caps
on
the
left
.
as
the
tsar
rode
up
to
one
flank
of
the
bat
talions
which
presented
arms
another
group
of
horsemen
galloped
up
to
the
opposite
flank
and
at
the
head
of
them
rostov
recognized

it
could
be
no

he
came
at

over

on

alexander
he
raised
his
hat
and
as
he
did
so
rost6v
with
his
cavalrymans
eye
could
not
help
noticing
that
napoleon
did
not
sit
well
or
firmly
in
the
saddle
.
the
battalions
shouted
hurrah
and
vive
iempereur
napoleon
said
something
to
alexander
and
both
emperors
dismounted
and
took
each
oth
ers
hands
.
napoleons
face
wore
an
unpleas
ant
and
artificial
smile
.
alexander
was
saying
something
affable
to
him
.
in
spite
of
the
trampling
of
the
french
gen
darmes
horses
which
were
pushing
back
the
crowd
rost6vkept
his
eyes
on
every
movement
of
alexander
and
bonaparte
.
it
struck
him
as
a
surprise
that
alexander
treated
bonaparte
as
an
equal
and
that
the
latter
was
quite
at
ease
with
the
tsar
as
if
such
relations
with
an
em
peror
were
an
everyday
matter
to
him
.
alexander
and
napoleon
with
the
long
train
of
their
suites
approached
the
right
flank
of
the
preobrazhnsk
battalion
and
came
straight
up
to
the
crowd
standing
there
.
the
crowd
un
expectedly
found
itself
so
close
to
the
emper
ors
that
rostov
standing
in
the
front
row
was
afraid
he
might
be
recognized
.
sire
i
ask
your
permission
to
present
the
legion
of
honor
to
the
bra
vest
of
your
soldiers
said
a
sharp
precise
voice
articulating
every
letter
.
this
was
said
by
the
undersized
napoleon
looking
up
straight
into
alexanders
eyes
.
alexander
listened
attentively
to
what
was
said
to
him
and
bending
his
head
smiled
pleasantly
.
to
him
who
has
borne
himself
most
brave
ly
in
this
last
war
added
napoleon
accentuat
ing
each
syllable
as
with
a
composure
and
as
surance
exasperating
to
rost6v
he
ran
his
eyes
over
the
russian
ranks
drawn
up
before
him
who
all
presented
arms
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
their
emperor
.
will
your
majesty
allow
me
to
consult
the
colonel
said
alexander
and
took
a
few
hasty
steps
toward
prince
kozldvski
the
commander
of
the
battalion
.
bonaparte
meanwhile
began
taking
the
glove
off
his
small
white
hand
tore
it
in
doing
so
and
threw
it
away
.
an
aidedecamp
behind
him
rushed
forward
and
picked
it
up
.
to
whom
shall
it
be
given
the
emperor
alexander
asked
kosl6vski
in
russian
in
a
low
voice
.
to
whomever
your
majesty
commands
.
the
emperor
knit
his
brows
with
dissatisfac
tion
and
glancing
back
remarked
but
we
must
give
him
an
answer
.
kozl6vski
scanned
the
ranks
resolutely
and
included
rostov
in
his
scrutiny
.
can
it
be
me
thought
rost6v
.
ldzarevl
the
colonel
called
with
a
frown
and
ldzarev
the
first
soldier
in
the
rank
stepped
briskly
forward
.
where
are
you
off
to
stop
here
voices
whispered
to
ldzarev
who
did
not
know
where
to
go
.
ldzarev
stopped
casting
a
sidelong
look
at
his
colonel
in
alarm
.
his
face
twitched
as
often
happens
to
soldiers
called
before
the
ranks
.
napoleon
slightly
turned
his
head
and
put
his
plump
little
hand
out
behind
him
as
if
to
take
something
.
the
members
of
his
suite
guess
ing
at
once
what
he
wanted
moved
about
and
whispered
as
they
passed
something
from
one
to
another
and
a
page
the
same
one
rost6v
had
seen
the
previous
evening
at
boris
ran
forward
and
bowing
respectfully
over
the
out
stretched
hand
and
not
keeping
it
waiting
a
moment
laid
in
it
an
order
on
a
red
ribbon
.
napoleon
without
looking
pressed
two
fingers
together
and
the
badge
was
between
them
.
then
he
approached
ldzarev
who
rolled
his
eyes
and
persistently
gazed
at
his
own
mon
arch
looked
round
at
the
emperor
alexander
to
imply
that
what
he
was
now
doing
was
done
for
the
sake
of
his
ally
and
the
small
white
hand
holding
the
order
touched
one
of
lza
revs
buttons
.
it
was
as
if
napoleon
knew
that
it
was
only
necessary
for
his
hand
to
deign
to
touch
that
soldiers
breast
for
the
soldier
to
be
forever
happy
rewarded
and
distinguished
from
everyone
else
in
the
world
.
napoleon
merely
laid
the
cross
on
ldzarevs
breast
and
dropping
his
hand
turned
toward
alexander
book

as
though
sure
that
the
cross
would
adhere
there
.
and
it
really
did
.
officious
hands
russian
and
french
im
mediately
seized
the
cross
and
fastened
it
to
the
uniform
.
ldzarev
glanced
morosely
at
the
lit
tle
man
with
white
hands
who
was
doing
some
thing
to
him
and
still
standing
motionless
pre
senting
arms
looked
again
straight
into
alex
anders
eyes
as
if
asking
whether
he
should
stand
there
or
go
away
or
do
something
else
.
but
receiving
no
orders
he
remained
for
some
time
in
that
rigid
position
.
the
emperors
remounted
and
rode
away
.
the
preobrazhensk
battalion
breaking
rank
mingled
with
the
french
guards
and
sat
down
at
the
tables
prepared
for
them
.
lazarev
sat
in
the
place
of
honor
.
russian
and
french
officers
embraced
him
congratulat
ed
him
and
pressed
his
hands
.
crowds
of
offi
cers
and
civilians
drew
near
merely
to
see
him
.
a
rumble
of
russian
and
french
voices
and
laughter
filled
the
air
round
the
tables
in
the
square
.
two
officers
with
flushed
faces
look
ing
cheerful
and
happy
passed
by

he
must
respond
in
kind
.
borfs
too
with
his
friend
zhilfnski
came
to
see
the
preobrazhdnsk
banquet
.
on
his
way
back
he
noticed
rost6v
standing
by
the
cor
ner
of
a
house
.
rost6v
how
dyou
do
we
missed
one
an
other
he
said
and
could
not
refrain
from
ask
ing
what
was
the
matter
so
strangely
dismal
and
troubled
was
rost6vs
face
.
nothing
nothing
replied
rost6v
.
youll
call
round
yes
i
will
.
rost6v
stood
at
that
corner
for
a
long
time
watching
the
feast
from
a
distance
.
in
his
mind
a
painful
process
was
going
on
which
he
could
not
bring
to
a
conclusion
.
terrible
doubts
rose
in
his
soul
.
now
he
remembered
denisov
with
his
changed
expression
his
submission
and
the
whole
hospital
with
arms
and
legs
torn
off
and
its
dirt
and
disease
.
so
vividly
did
he
recall
that
hospital
stench
of
dead
flesh
that
he
looked
round
to
see
where
the
smell
came
from
.
next
he
thought
of
that
selfsatisfied
bonaparte
with
his
small
white
hand
who
was
now
an
em
peror
liked
and
respected
by
alexander
.
then
why
those
severed
arms
and
legs
and
those
dead
men

.

.

.
then
again
he
thought
of
ldzarev
re
warded
and
denfsov
punished
and
unpar
doned
.
he
caught
himself
harboring
such
strange
thoughts
that
he
was
frightened
.
the
smell
of
the
food
the
preobrazhnskis
were
eating
and
a
sense
of
hunger
recalled
him
from
these
reflections
he
had
to
get
something
to
eat
before
going
away
.
he
went
to
a
hotel
he
had
noticed
that
morning
.
there
he
found
so
many
people
among
them
officers
who
like
himself
had
come
in
civilian
clothes
that
he
had
difficulty
in
getting
a
dinner
.
two
officers
of
his
own
division
joined
him
.
the
conversa
tion
naturally
turned
on
the
peace
.
the
offi
cers
his
comrades
like
most
of
the
army
were
dissatisfied
with
the
peace
concluded
after
the
battle
of
friedland
.
they
said
that
had
we
held
out
a
little
longer
napoleon
would
have
been
done
for
as
his
troops
had
neither
provisions
nor
ammunition
.
nicholas
ate
and
drank
chiefly
the
latter
in
silence
.
he
finished
a
couple
of
bottles
of
wine
by
himself
.
the
pro
cess
in
his
mind
went
on
tormenting
him
with
out
reaching
a
conclusion
.
he
feared
to
give
way
to
his
thoughts
yet
could
not
get
rid
of
them
.
suddenly
on
one
of
the
officers
saying
that
it
was
humiliating
to
look
at
the
french
rostov
began
shouting
with
uncalledfor
wrath
and
therefore
much
to
the
surprise
of
the
offi
cers
how
can
you
judge
whats
best
he
cried
the
blood
suddenly
rushing
to
his
face
.
how
can
you
judge
the
emperors
actions
what
right
have
we
to
argue
we
cannot
compre
hend
either
the
emperorsaims
or
his
actions
but
i
never
said
a
word
about
the
emper
or
said
the
officer
justifying
himself
and
un
able
to
understand
rostovs
outburst
except
on
the
supposition
that
he
was
drunk
.
but
rost6v
did
not
listen
to
him
.
we
are
not
diplomatic
officials
we
are
sol
diers
and
nothing
more
he
went
on
.
if
we
are
ordered
to
die
we
must
die
.
if
were
pun

war
and
peace
ished
it
means
that
we
have
deserved
it
its
not
for
us
to
judge
.
if
the
emperor
pleases
to
recognize
bonaparte
as
emperor
and
to
con
clude
an
alliance
with
him
it
means
that
that
is
the
right
thing
to
do
.
if
once
we
begin
judg
ing
and
arguing
about
everything
nothing
sa
cred
will
be
left
that
way
we
shall
be
saying
there
is
no
god
nothing
shouted
nicholas
banging
the
table
very
little
to
the
point
as
it
seemed
to
his
listeners
but
quite
relevantly
to
the
course
of
his
own
thoughts
.
our
business
is
to
do
our
duty
to
fight
and
not
to
think
thats
all

said
he
.
and
to
drink
said
one
of
the
officers
not
wishing
to
quarrel
.
yes
and
to
drink
assented
nicholas
.

the

a
fresh
interview
with
the
emperor
na
poleon
and
in
the
upper
circles
of
petersburg
there
was
much
talk
of
the
grandeur
of
this
important
meeting
.

to
cooperate
with

and
in

the
possibility
of

between

of

was
spoken
of
.

was
at

prince
andrew
had
spent
two
years
continu
ously
in
the
country
.
all
the
plans
pierre
had
attempted
on
his
es
tatesand
constantly
changing
from
one
thing
to
another
had
never
accomplishedwere
car
ried
out
by
prince
andrew
without
display
and
without
perceptible
difficulty
.
he
had
in
the
highest
degree
a
practical
te
nacity
which
pierre
lacked
and
without
fuss
or
strain
on
his
part
this
set
things
going
.
on
one
of
his
estates
the
three
hundred
serfs
were
liberated
and
became
free
agricultural
laborers
this
being
one
of
the
first
examples
of
the
kind
in
russia
.
on
other
estates
the
serfs
compulsory
labor
was
commuted
for
a
quitrent
.
a
trained
midwife
was
engaged
for
bogucharovo
at
his
expense
and
a
priest
was
paid
to
teach
reading
and
writing
to
the
chil
dren
of
the
peasants
and
household
serfs
.
prince
andrew
spent
half
his
time
at
bald
hills
with
his
father
and
his
son
who
was
still
in
the
care
of
nurses
.
the
other
half
he
spent
in
bogucharovo
cloister
as
his
father
called
prince
andrews
estate
.
despite
the
indiffer
ence
to
the
affairs
of
the
world
he
had
expressed
to
pierre
he
diligently
followed
all
that
went
on
received
many
books
and
to
his
surprise
noticed
that
when
he
or
his
father
had
visitors
from
petersburg
the
very
vortex
of
life
these
people
lagged
behind
himself
who
never
left
the
country
in
knowledge
of
what
was
hap
pening
in
home
and
foreign
affairs
.
besides
being
occupied
with
his
estates
and
reading
a
great
variety
of
books
prince
an
drew
was
at
this
time
busy
with
a
critical
sur
vey
of
our
last
two
unfortunate
campaigns
and
with
drawing
up
a
proposal
for
a
reform
of
the
army
rules
and
regulations
.
in
the
spring
of
1
809
he
went
to
visit
the
ry
azdn
estates
which
had
been
inherited
by
his
son
whose
guardian
he
was
.
warmed
by
the
spring
sunshine
he
sat
in
the
caliche
looking
at
the
new
grass
the
first
leaves
on
th
birches
and
the
first
puffs
of
white
spring
clouds
floating
across
the
clear
blue
sky
.
he
was
not
thinking
of
anything
but
looked
absentmindedly
and
cheerfully
from
side
to
side
.
they
crossed
the
ferry
where
he
had
talked
with
pierre
the
year
before
.
they
went
through
the
muddy
village
past
threshing
floors
and
green
fields
of
winter
rye
downhill
where
snow
still
lodged
near
the
bridge
uphill
where
the
clay
had
been
liquefied
by
the
rain
past
strips
of
stubble
land
and
bushes
touched
with
green
here
and
there
and
into
a
birch
forest
grow
ing
on
both
sides
of
the
road
.
in
the
forest
it
was
almost
hot
no
wind
could
be
felt
.
the
birches
with
their
sticky
green
leaves
were
mo
tionless
and
lilaccolored
flowers
and
the
first
blades
of
green
grass
were
pushing
up
and
lifting
last
years
leaves
.
the
coarse
evergreen
color
of
the
small
fir
trees
scattered
here
and
there
among
the
birches
was
an
unpleasant
re
minder
of
winter
.
on
entering
the
forest
the
horses
began
to
snort
and
sweated
visibly
.
peter
the
footman
made
some
remark
to
the
coachman
the
latter
assented
.
but
apparently
the
coachmans
sympathy
was
not
enough
for
peter
and
he
turned
on
the
box
toward
his
master
.
how
pleasant
it
is
your
excellency
he
said
with
a
respectful
smile
.
what
its
pleasant
your
excellency
what
is
he
talking
about
thought
prince
andrew
.
oh
the
spring
i
suppose
he
thought
as
he
turned
round
.
yes
really
every
thing
is
green
already
.

.

.

.
how
early
the
birches
and
cherry
and
alders
too
are
coming
out
.

.

.

.
but
the
oaks
show
no
sign
yet
.
ah
here
is
one
oak
at
the
edge
of
the
road
stood
an
oak
.
prob
ably
ten
times
the
age
of
the
birches
that
formed
the
forest
it
was
ten
times
as
thick
and
twice
as
tall
as
they
.
it
was
an
enormous
tree
its
girth
twice
as
great
as
a
man
could
embrace
and
evi
dently
long
ago
some
of
its
branches
had
been
broken
off
and
its
bark
scarred
.
with
its
huge
war
and
peace
ungainly
limbs
sprawling
unsymmetrically
and
its
gnarled
hands
and
fingers
it
stood
an
aged
stern
and
scornful
monster
among
the
smiling
birch
trees
.
only
the
deadlooking
ev
ergreen
firs
dotted
about
in
the
forest
and
this
oak
refused
to
yield
to
the
charm
of
spring
or
notice
either
the
spring
or
the
sunshine
.
spring
love
happiness
this
oak
seemed
to
say
.
are
you
not
weary
of
that
stupid
mean
ingless
constantly
repeated
fraud
always
the
same
and
always
a
fraud
there
is
no
spring
no
sun
no
happiness
look
at
those
cramped
dead
firs
ever
the
same
and
at
me
too
stick
ing
out
my
broken
and
barked
fingers
just
where
they
have
grown
whether
from
my
back
or
my
sides
as
they
have
grown
so
i
stand
and
i
do
not
believe
in
your
hopes
and
your
lies
.
as
he
passed
through
the
forest
prince
an
drew
turned
several
times
to
look
at
that
oak
as
if
expecting
something
from
it
.
under
the
oak
too
were
flowers
and
grass
but
it
stood
among
them
scowling
rigid
misshapen
and
grim
as
ever
.
yes
the
oak
is
right
a
thousand
times
right
thought
prince
andrew
.
let
others
the
young
yield
afresh
to
that
fraud
but
we
know
life
our
life
is
finished
a
whole
sequence
of
new
thoughts
hopeless
but
mournfully
pleasant
rose
in
his
soul
in
connection
with
that
tree
.
during
this
journey
he
as
it
were
considered
his
life
afresh
and
ar
rived
at
his
old
conclusion
restful
in
its
hope
lessness
that
it
was
not
for
him
to
begin
any
thing
anew
but
that
he
must
live
out
his
life
content
to
do
no
harm
and
not
disturbing
himself
or
desiring
anything
.
chapter
ii
prince
andrew
had
to
see
the
marshal
of
the
nobility
for
the
district
in
connection
with
the
affairs
of
the
ryazan
estate
of
which
he
was
trustee
.
this
marshal
was
count
ilyd
rost6v
and
in
the
middle
of
may
prince
andrew
went
to
visit
him
.
it
was
now
hot
spring
weather
.
the
whole
forest
was
already
clothed
in
green
.
it
was
dusty
and
so
hot
that
on
passing
near
water
one
longed
to
bathe
.
prince
andrew
depressed
and
preoccupied
with
the
business
about
which
he
had
to
speak
to
the
marshal
was
driving
up
the
avenue
in
the
grounds
of
the
rost6vs
house
at
otradnoe
.
he
heard
merry
girlish
cries
behind
some
trees
on
the
right
and
saw
a
group
of
girls
running
to
cross
the
path
of
his
caliche
.
ahead
of
the
rest
and
nearer
to
him
ran
a
darkhaired
remark
ably
slim
pretty
girl
in
a
yellow
chintz
dress
wiih
a
white
handkerchief
on
her
head
from
under
which
loose
locks
of
hair
escaped
.
the
girl
was
shouting
something
but
seeing
that
he
was
a
stranger
ran
back
laughing
without
look
ing
at
him
.
suddenly
he
did
not
know
why
he
felt
a
pang
.
the
day
was
so
beautiful
the
sun
so
bright
everything
around
so
gay
but
that
slim
pretty
girl
did
not
know
or
wish
to
know
of
his
existence
and
was
contented
and
cheerful
in
her
own
separate
probably
foolish
but
bright
and
happy
life
.
what
is
she
so
glad
about
what
is
she
thinking
of
not
of
the
mil
itary
regulations
or
of
the
arrangement
of

of

why
is

happy
prince

asked
himself

instinctive
curiosity

living
at

just
as
he
had
done
in
former
years
that
is
entertaining
almost
the
whole
province
with
hunts
theatricals
dinners
and
music
.
he
was
glad
to
see
prince
andrew
as
he
was
to
see
any
new
visitor
and
insisted
on
his
staying
the
night
.
during
the
dull
day
in
the
course
of
which
he
was
entertained
by
his
elderly
hosts
and
by
the
more
important
of
the
visitors
the
old
counts
house
was
crowded
on
account
of
an
approaching
name
day
prince
andrew
repeat
edly
glanced
at
natisha
gay
and
laughing
among
the
younger
members
of
the
company
and
asked
himself
each
time
what
is
she
thinking
about
why
is
she
so
glad
that
night
alone
in
new
surroundings
he
was
long
unable
to
sleep
.
he
read
awhile
and
then
put
out
his
candle
but
relit
it
.
it
was
hot
in
the
room
the
inside
shutters
of
which
were
closed
.
he
was
cross
with
the
stupid
old
man
as
he
called
rost6v
who
had
made
him
stay
by
assuring
him
that
some
necessary
documents
had
not
yet
arrived
from
town
and
he
was
vexed
with
himself
for
having
stayed
.
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
to
open
it
.
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
shutters
the
moon
light
as
if
it
had
long
been
watching
for
this
burst
into
the
room
.
he
opened
the
casement
.
the
night
was
fresh
bright
and
very
still
.
just
before
the
window
was
a
row
of
pollard
trees
looking
black
on
one
side
and
with
a
silvery
light
on
the
other
.
beneath
the
trees
grew
some
kind
of
lush
wet
bushy
vegetation
with
silver
lit
leaves
and
stems
here
and
there
.
farther
back
beyond
the
dark
trees
a
roof
glittered
with
dew
to
the
right
was
a
leafy
tree
with
brilliant
ly
white
trunk
and
branches
and
above
it
shone
book
six

the
moon
nearly
at
its
full
in
a
pale
almost
starless
spring
sky
.
prince
andrew
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
window
ledge
and
his
eyes
rested
on
that
sky
.
his
room
was
on
the
first
floor
.
those
in
the
rooms
above
were
also
awake
.
he
heard
female
voices
overhead
.
just
once
more
said
a
girlish
voice
above
him
which
prince
andrew
recognized
at
once
.
but
when
are
you
coming
to
bed
replied
another
voice
.
i
wont
i
cant
sleep
whats
the
use
come
now
for
the
last
time
.
two
girlish
voices
sang
a
musical
passage
the
end
of
some
song
.
ohhowlovelyl
now
go
to
sleep
and
theres
an
end
of
it
.
you
go
to
sleep
but
i
cant
said
the
first
voice
coming
nearer
to
the
window
.
she
was
evidently
leaning
right
out
for
the
rustle
of
her
dress
and
even
her
breathing
could
be
heard
.
everything
was
stonestill
like
the
moon
and
its
light
and
the
shadows
.
prince
andrew
too
dared
not
stir
for
fear
of
betraying
his
un
intentional
presence
.
s6nyal
s6nyal
he
again
heard
the
first
speaker
.
oh
how
can
you
sleep
only
look
how
glorious
it
is
ah
how
glorious
do
wake
up
s6nya
she
said
almost
with
tears
in
her
voice
.
there
never
never
was
such
a
lovely
night
before
s6nya
made
some
reluctant
reply
.
do
just
come
and
see
what
a
moon

.

.

.
oh
how
lovely
come
here
.

.

.

.
darling
sweet
heart
come
here
there
you
see
i
feel
like
sitting
down
on
my
heels
putting
my
arms
round
my
knees
like
this
straining
tight
as
tight
as
possible
and
flying
away
like
this

take
care
youll
fall
out
.
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
scuffle
and
s6nyas
disapproving
voice
its
past
one
oclock
.
oh
you
only
spoil
things
for
me
.
all
right
gog


again
all
was
silent
but
prince
andrew
knew
she
was
still
sitting
there
.
from
time
to
time
he
heard
a
soft
rustle
and
at
times
a
sigh
.
o
god
o
god
what
does
it
mean
she
suddenly
exclaimed
.
to
bed
then
if
it
must
be
and
she
slammed
the
casement
.
for
her
i
might
as
well
not
exist
thought
prince
andrew
while
he
listened
to
her
voice
for
some
reason
expecting
yet
fearing
that
she
might
say
something
about
him
.
there
she
is
again
as
if
it
were
on
purpose
thought
he
.
in
his
soul
there
suddenly
arose
such
an
un
expected
turmoil
of
youthful
thoughts
and
hopes
contrary
to
the
whole
tenor
of
his
life
that
unable
to
explain
his
condition
to
himself
he
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
at
once
.
chapter
iii
next
morning
having
taken
leave
of
no
one
but
the
count
and
not
waiting
for
the
ladies
to
appear
prince
andrew
set
off
for
home
.
it
was
already
the
beginning
of
june
when
on
his
return
journey
he
drove
into
the
birch
forest
where
the
gnarled
old
oak
had
made
so
strange
and
memorable
an
impression
on
him
.
in
the
forest
the
harness
bells
sounded
yet
more

muffled
than
they
had
done
six
weeks
before
for
now
all
was
thick
shady
and
dense
and
the
young
firs
dotted
about
in
the
forest
did
not
jar
on
the
general
beauty
but
lending
them
selves
to
the
mood
around
were
delicately
green
with
fluffy
young
shoots
.
the
whole
day
had
been
hot
.
somewhere
a
storm
was
gathering
but
only
a
small
cloud

.
had
scattered
some
raindrops
lightly
sprin
kling
the
road
and
the
sappy
leaves
.
the
left
side
of
the
forest
was
dark
in
the
shade
the
right
side
glittered
in
the
sunlight
wet
and
shiny
and
scarcely
swayed
by
the
breeze
.
every
thing
was
in
blossom
the
nightingales
trilled
and
their
voices
reverberated
now
near
now
far
away
.
yes
here
in
this
forest
was
that
oak
with
which
i
agreed
thought
prince
andrew
.
but
where
is
it
he
again
wondered
gazing
at
the
left
side
of
the
road
and
without
recognizing
it
he
looked
with
admiration
at
the
very
oak
he
sought
.
the
old
oak
quite
transfigured
spreading
out
a
canopy
of
sappy
darkgreen
foliage
stood
rapt
and
slightly
trembling
in
the
rays
of
the
evening
sun
.
neither
gnarled
fin
gers
nor
old
scars
nor
old
doubts
and
sorrows
were
any
of
them
in
evidence
now
.
through
the
hard
centuryold
bark
even
where
there
were
no
twigs
leaves
had
sprouted
such
as
one
could
hardly
believe
the
old
veteran
could
have
produced
.
yes
it
is
the
same
oak
thought
prince
an
drew
and
all
at
once
he
was
seized
by
an
un
reasoning
springtime
feeling
of
joy
and
renew
al
.
all
the
best
moments
of
his
life
suddenly
rose
to
his
memory
.
austerlitz
with
the
lofty
heavens
his
wifes
dead
reproachful
face
pierre
at
the
ferry
that
girl
thrilled
by
the
beauty
of
the
night
and
that
night
itself
and
the
moon
and

..
.
all
this
rushed
suddenly
to
his
mind
.
no
life
is
not
over
at
thirtyone
prince
andrew
suddenly
decided
finally
and
decisively
.
838
it
is
not
enough
for
me
to
know
what
i
have
in
me
everyone
must
know
it
pierre
and
that
young
girl
who
wanted
to
fly
away
into
the
sky
everyone
must
know
me
so
that
my
life
may
not
be
lived
for
myself
alone
while
others
live
so
apart
from
it
but
so
that
it
may
be
re
flected
in
them
all
and
they
and
i
may
live
in
harmony
on
reaching
home
prince
andrew
decided
to
go
to
petersburg
that
autumn
and
found
all
sorts
of
reasons
for
this
decision
.
a
whole
series
of
sensible
and
logical
considerations
showing
it
to
be
essential
for
him
to
go
to
petersburg
and
even
to
reenter
the
service
kept
spring
ing
up
in
his
mind
.
he
could
not
now
under
stand
how
he
could
ever
even
have
doubted
the
necessity
of
taking
an
active
share
in
life
just
as
a
month
before
he
had
not
understood
how
the
idea
of
leaving
the
quiet
country
could
ever
enter
his
head
.
it
now
seemed
clear
to
him
that
all
his
experience
of
life
must
be
senseless
ly
wasted
unless
he
applied
it
to
some
kind
of
work
and
again
played
an
active
part
in
life
.
he
did
not
even
remember
how
formerly
on
the
strength
of
similar
wretched
logical
argu
ments
it
had
seemed
obvious
that
he
would
be
degrading
himself
if
he
now
after
the
les
sons
he
had
had
in
life
allowed
himself
to
be
lieve
in
the
possibility
of
being
useful
and
in
the
possibility
of
happiness
or
love
.
nowreason
suggested
quite
the
opposite
.
after
that
jour
ney
to
ryazan
he
found
the
country
dull
his
former
pursuits
no
longer
interested
him
and
often
when
sitting
alone
in
his
study
he
got
up
went
to
the
mirror
and
gazed
a
long
time
at
his
own
face
.
then
he
would
turn
away
to
the
por
trait
of
his
dead
lise
who
with
hair
curled
a
la
grecque
looked
tenderly
and
gaily
at
him
out
of
the
gilt
frame
.
she
did
not
now
say
those
former
terrible
words
to
him
but
looked
sim
ply
merrily
and
inquisitively
at
him
.
and
prince
andrew
crossing
his
arms
behind
him
jong
paced
the
room
now
frowning
now
smil
ing
as
he
reflected
on
those
irrational
inex
pressible
thoughts
secret
as
a
crime
which
al
tered
his
whole
life
and
were
connected
with
pierre
with
fame
with
the
girl
at
the
window
the
oak
and
womans
beauty
and
love
.
and
if
anyone
came
into
his
room
at
such
moments
he
was
particularly
cold
stern
and
above
all
unpleasantly
logical
.
my
dear
princess
mary
entering
at
such
a
moment
would
say
little
nicholas
cant
go
out
today
its
very
cold
.
if
it
were
hot
prince
andrew
would
reply
war
and
peace
at
such
times
very
dryly
to
his
sister
he
could
go
out
in
his
smock
but
as
it
is
cold
he
must
wear
warm
clothes
which
were
designed
for
that
purpose
.
that
is
what
follows
from
the
fact
that
it
is
cold
and
not
that
a
child
who
needs
fresh
air
should
remain
at
home
he
would
add
with
extreme
logic
as
if
punishing
someone
for
those
secret
illogical
emotions
that
stirred
within
him
.
at
such
moments
princess
mary
would
think
how
intellectual
work
dries
men
up
.
chapter
iv
prince
andrew
arrived
in
petersburg
in
au
gust
1809
.
it
was
the
time
when
the
youthful
sperdnski
was
at
the
zenith
of
his
fame
and
his
reforms
were
being
pushed
forward
with
the
greatest
energy
.
that
same
august
the
emper
or
was
thrown
from
his
calche
injured
his
leg
and
remained
three
weeks
at
peterhof
receiv
ing
speranski
every
day
and
no
one
else
.
at
that
time
the
two
famous
decrees
were
being
prepared
that
so
agitated
societyabolishing
court
ranks
and
introducing
examinations
to
qualify
for
the
grades
of
collegiate
assessor
and
state
councilorand
not
merely
these
but
a
whole
state
constitution
intended
to
change
the
existing
order
of
government
in
russia
le
gal
administrative
and
financial
from
the
council
of
state
down
to
the
district
tribunals
.
now
those
vague
liberal
dreams
with
which
the
emperor
alexander
had
ascended
the
throne
and
which
he
had
tried
to
put
into
effect
with
the
aid
of
his
associates
czartoryski
novosflt
sev
kochubdy
and
str6ganov
whom
he
him
self
in
jest
had
called
his
comitd
desalut
public
were
taking
shape
and
being
realized
.
now
all
these
men
were
replaced
by
speran
ski
on
the
civil
side
and
arakcheev
on
the
mili
tary
.
soon
after
his
arrival
prince
andrew
as
a
gentleman
of
the
chamber
presented
himself
at
court
and
at
a
levee
.
the
emperor
though
he
met
him
twice
did
not
favor
him
with
a
single
word
.
it
had
always
seemed
to
prince
andrew
before
that
he
was
antipathetic
to
the
emperor
and
that
the
latter
disliked
his
face
and
personality
generally
and
in
the
cold
re
pellent
glance
the
emperor
gave
him
he
now
found
further
confirmation
of
this
surmise
.
the
courtiers
explained
the
emperors
neglect
of
him
by
his
majestys
displeasure
at
bol
k6nskis
not
having
served
since
1805
.
i
know
myself
that
one
cannot
help
ones
sympathies
and
antipathies
thought
prince
andrew
so
it
will
not
do
to
present
my
pro
posal
for
the
reform
of
the
army
regulations
to
book
six
the
emperor
personally
but
the
project
will
speak
for
itself
.
he
mentioned
what
he
had
written
to
an
old
field
marshal
a
friend
of
his
fathers
.
the
field
marshal
made
an
appointment
to
see
him
received
him
graciously
and
promised
to
in
form
the
emperor
.
a
few
days
later
prince
an
drew
received
notice
that
he
was
to
go
to
see
the
minister
of
war
count
arakchev
.
on
the
appointed
day
prince
andrew
en
tered
count
arakchevs
waiting
room
at
nine
in
the
morning
.
he
did
not
know
arakchev
personally
had
never
seen
him
and
all
he
had
heard
of
him
in
spired
him
with
but
little
respect
for
the
man
.
he
is
minister
of
war
a
man
trusted
by
the
emperor
and
i
need
not
concern
myself
about
his
personal
qualities
he
has
been
commis
sioned
to
consider
my
project
so
he
alone
can
get
it
adopted
thought
prince
andrew
as
he
waited
among
a
number
of
important
and
un
important
people
in
count
arakchevs
wait
ing
room
.
during
his
service
chiefly
as
an
adjutant
prince
andrew
had
seen
the
anterooms
of
many
important
men
and
the
different
types
of
such
rooms
were
well
known
to
him
.
count
arak
chevs
anteroom
had
quite
a
special
character
.
the
faces
of
the
unimportant
people
awaiting
their
turn
for
an
audience
showed
embarrass
ment
and
servility
the
faces
of
those
of
higher
rank
expressed
a
common
feeling
of
awkward
ness
covered
by
a
mask
of
unconcern
and
rid
icule
of
themselves
their
situation
and
the
per
son
for
whom
they
were
waiting
.
some
walked
thoughtfully
up
and
down
others
whispered
and
laughed
.
prince
andrew
heard
the
nick
name
silaandrevich

and
the
words
uncle
will
give
it
to
us
hot
in
reference
to
count
arakchev
.
one
general
an
important
per
sonage
evidently
feeling
offended
at
having
to
wait
so
long
sat
crossing
and
uncrossing
his
legs
and
smiling
contemptuously
to
himself
.
but
the
moment
the
door
opened
one
feel
ing
alone
appeared
on
all
faces
that
of
fear
.
prince
andrew
for
the
second
time
asked
the
adjutant
on
duty
to
take
in
his
name
but
re
ceived
an
ironical
look
and
was
told
that
his
turn
would
come
in
due
course
.
after
some
others
had
been
shown
in
and
out
of
the
min
isters
room
by
the
adjutant
on
duty
an
officer
who
struck
prince
andrew
by
his
humiliated
and
frightened
air
was
admitted
at
that
terri
ble
door
.
this
officers
audience
lasted
a
long
l
sila
means
force
.
time
.
then
suddenly
the
grating
sound
of
a
harsh
voice
was
heard
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
and
the
officerwith
pale
face
and
trembling
lips
came
out
and
passed
through
the
waiting
room
clutching
his
head
.
after
this
prince
andrew
was
conducted
to
the
door
and
the
officer
on
duty
said
in
a
whis
per
to
the
right
at
the
window
.
prince
andrew
entered
a
plain
tidy
room
and
saw
at
the
table
a
man
of
forty
with
a
long
waist
a
long
closely
cropped
head

chapter
v
while
waiting
for
the
announcement
of
his
appointment
to
the
committee
prince
andrew
looked
up
his
former
acquaintances
particu
larly
those
he
knew
to
be
in
power
and
whose
aid
he
might
need
.
in
petersburg
he
now
ex
perienced
the
same
feeling
he
had
had
on
the
eve
of
a
battle
when
troubled
by
anxious
cu
riosity
and
irresistibly
attracted
to
the
ruling
circles
where
the
future
on
which
the
fate
of
millions
depended
was
beingshaped
.
from
the
irritation
of
the
older
men
the
curiosity
of
the
uninitiated
the
reserve
of
the
initiated
the
hurry
and
preoccupation
of
everyone
and
the
innumerable
committees
and
commissions
of
whose
existence
he
learned
every
day
he
felt
that
now
in
1809
here
in
petersburg
a
vast
civil
conflict
was
in
preparation
the
command
er
in
chief
of
which
was
a
mysterious
person
he
did
not
know
but
who
was
supposed
to
be
a
man
of
genius
speranski
.
and
this
movement
of
reconstruction
of
which
prince
andrew
had
a
vague
idea
and
sperdnski
its
chief
promoter
began
to
interest
him
so
keenly
that
the
ques
tion
of
the
army
regulations
quickly
receded
to
a
secondary
place
in
his
consciousness
.
prince
andrew
was
most
favorably
placed
to
secure
a
good
reception
in
the
highest
and
most
diverse
petersburg
circles
of
the
day
.
the
re
forming
party
cordially
welcomed
and
courted
him
in
the
first
place
because
he
was
reputed
to
be
clever
and
very
well
read
and
secondly
be
cause
by
liberating
his
serfs
he
had
obtained
the
reputation
of
being
a
liberal
.
the
party
of
the
old
and
dissatisfied
who
censured
the
in
novations
turned
to
him
expecting
his
sympa
thy
in
their
disapproval
of
the
reforms
simply
because
he
was
the
son
of
his
father
.
the
fem
inine
society
world
welcomed
him
gladly
be
cause
he
was
rich
distinguished
a
good
match
and
almost
a
newcomer
with
a
halo
of
romance
on
account
of
his
supposed
death
and
the
tragic
loss
of
his
wife
.
besides
this
the
general
opin
ion
of
all
who
had
known
him
previously
was
that
he
had
greatly
improved
during
these
last
five
years
having
softened
and
grown
more
manly
lost
his
former
affectation
pride
and
contemptuous
irony
and
acquired
the
serenity
that
comes
with
years
.
people
talked
about
him
were
interested
in
him
and
wanted
to
meet
him
.
the
day
after
his
interview
with
count
ar
akchev
prince
andrew
spent
the
evening
at
count
kochubys
.
he
told
the
count
of
his
interview
with
sila
andre
evich
kochubey
spoke
of
arakcheev
by
that
nickname
with
the
same
vague
irony
prince
andrew
had
noticed
in
the
minister
of

he
has

to
come
this

.
what
has
speranski
to
do
with

asked
prince
andrew
.
kochubey
shook
his
head
smilingly
as
if
sur
prised
at
bolk6nskis
simplicity
.
we
were
talking
to
him
about
you
a
few
days
ago
kochubey
continued
and
about
your
freed

.
oh
is
it
you

who
have
freed
your
serfs
said
an
old
man
of
catherines

turning
contemptuously
toward
bolk6nski
.
it
was
a
small
estate
that

prince

trying
to
extenuate
his
action
so
as
not
to

of

said
the
old
man
looking
at

.
theres

thing
i
dont

he
continued
.
who
will
plow
the
land
if
they
are

it
is
easy
to

but
difficult
to

count

he
rose
took
prince
andrew
by
the
arm
and
went
to
meet
a
tall
bald
fair
man
of
about
forty
with
a
large
open
forehead
and
a
long
face
of
unusu
al
and
peculiar
whiteness
who
was
just
enter
ing
.
the
newcomer
wore
a
blue
swallowtail
coat
with
a
cross
suspended
from
his
neck
and
a
star
on
his
left
breast
.
it
was
sperdnski
.
prince
andrew
recognized
him
at
once
and
felt
a
throb
within
him
as
happens
at
critical
mo
ments
of
life
.
whether
it
was
from
respect
en
vy
or
anticipation
he
did
not
know
.
speran
skis
whole
figure
was
of
a
peculiar
type
that
made
him
easily
recognizable
.
in
the
society
in
which
prince
andrew
lived
he
had
never
seen
anyone
who
together
with
awkward
and
clum
book
six
sy
gestures
possessed
such
calmness
and
self
assurance
he
had
never
seen
so
resolute
yet
gentle
an
expression
as
that
in
those
halfclosed
rather
humid
eyes
or
so
firm
a
smile
that
ex
pressed
nothing
nor
had
he
heard
such
a
re
fined
smooth
soft
voice
above
all
he
had
nev
er
seen
such
delicate
whiteness
of
face
or
hands
hands
which
were
broad
but
very
plump
soft
and
white
.
such
whiteness
and
softness
prince
andrew
had
only
seen
on
the
faces
of
soldiers
who
had
been
long
in
hospital
.
this
was
spe
rdnski
secretary
of
state
reporter
to
the
em
peror
and
his
companion
at
erfurt
where
he
had
more
than
once
met
and
talked
with
na
poleon
.
sperdnski
did
not
shift
his
eyes
from
one
face
to
another
as
people
involuntarily
do
on
en
tering
a
large
company
and
was
in
no
hurry
to
speak
.
he
spoke
slowly
with
assurance
that
he
would
be
listened
to
and
he
looked
only
at
the
person
with
whom
he
was
conversing
.
prince
andrew
followed
sperdnskis
every
word
and
movement
with
particular
attention
.
as
happens
to
some
people
especially
to
men
who
judge
those
near
to
them
severely
he
al
ways
on
meeting
anyone
newespecially
any
one
whom
like
speranski
he
knew
by
reputa
tionexpected
to
discover
in
him
the
perfec
tion
of
human
qualities
.
speranski
told
kochubdy
he
was
sorry
he
had
been
unable
to
come
sooner
as
he
had
been
detained
at
the
palace
.
he
did
not
say
that
the
emperor
had
kept
him
and
prince
andrew
noticed
this
affectation
of
modesty
.
when
ko
chubey
introduced
prince
andrew
sperdnski
slowly
turned
his
eyes
to
bolk6nski
with
his
customary
smile
and
looked
at
him
in
silence
.
i
am
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
.
i
had
heard
of
you
as
everyone
has
he
said
after
a
pause
.
kochubey
said
a
few
words
about
the
recep
tion
arakchev
had
given
bolk6nski
.
sperdnski
smiled
more
markedly
.
the
chairman
of
the
committee
on
army
regulations
is
my
good
friend
monsieur
mag
nftski
he
said
fully
articulating
every
word
and
syllable
and
if
you
like
i
can
put
you
in
touch
with
him
.
he
paused
at
the
full
stop
.
i
hope
you
will
find
him
sympathetic
and
ready
to
cooperate
in
promoting
all
that
is
reasonable
.
a
circle
soon
formed
round
sperdnski
and
the
old
man
who
had
talked
about
his
subordi
nate
prydnichnikov
addressed
a
question
to
him
.
prince
andrew
without
joining
in
the
con
versation
watched
every
movement
of
sperdn
skis
this
man
not
long
since
an
insignificant
divinity
student
who
now
bolk6nski
thought
held
in
his
hands
those
plump
white
hands
the
fate
of
russia
.
prince
andrew
was
struck
by
the
extraordinarily
disdainful
composure
with
which
sperdnski
answered
the
old
man
.
he
appeared
to
address
condescending
words
to
him
from
an
immeasurable
height
.
when
the
old
man
began
to
speak
too
loud
sperdn
ski
smiled
and
said
he
could
not
judge
of
the
advantage
or
disadvantage
of
what
pleased
the
sovereign
.
having
talked
for
a
little
while
in
the
gen
eral
circle
sperdnski
rose
and
coming
up
to
prince
andrew
took
him
along
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
it
was
clear
that
he
thought
it
necessary
to
interest
himself
in
bolk6nski
.
i
had
no
chance
to
talk
with
you
prince
during
the
animated
conversation
in
which
that
venerable
gentleman
involved
me
he
said
with
a
mildly
contemptuous
smile
as
if
intimating
by
that
smile
that
he
and
prince
andrew
understood
the
insignificance
of
the
people
with
whom
he
had
just
been
talking
.
this
flattered
prince
andrew
.
i
have
known
of
you
for
a
long
time
first
from
your
action
with
regard
to
your
serfs
a
first
example
of
which
it
is
very
desirable
that
there
should
be
more
imitators
and
secondly
because
you
are
one
of
those
gentlemen
of
the
chamber
who
have
not
considered
themselves
offended
by
the
new
decree
concerning
the
ranks
allotted
to
courtiers
which
is
causing
so
much
gossip
and
tittletattle
.
no
said
prince
andrew
my
father
did
not
wish
me
to
take
advantage
of
the
privilege
.
i
began
the
service
from
the
lower
grade
.
your
father
a
man
of
the
last
century
evi
dently
stands
above
our
contemporaries
who
so
condemn
this
measure
which
merely
re
establishes
natural
justice
.
i
think
however
that
these
condemnations
have
some
ground
returned
prince
andrew
trying
to
resist
sperdnskis
influence
of
which
he
began
to
be
conscious
.
he
did
not
like
to
agree
with
him
in
everything
and
felt
a
wish
to
contradict
.
though
he
usually
spoke
easily
and
well
he
felt
a
difficulty
in
expressing
himself
now
while
talking
with
sperdnski
.
he
was
too
much
absorbed
in
observing
the
famous
mans
personality
.
grounds
of
personal
ambition
maybe
sperdnski
put
in
quietly
.
and
of
state
interest
to
some
extent
said
prince
andrew
.

what
do
you

asked
sperdnski
quiet
ly
lowering
his
eyes
.
i
am
an
admirer
of
montesquieu
replied
prince
andrew
and
his
idea
that

certains
droits
et
privileges
de

me
paraissent

des

de
sou
tenir
ce
sentiment
.

the
smile
vanished
from
sperdnskis
white
face
which
was
much
improved
by
the
change
.
probably
prince
andrews
thought
interested
him
.
si
vous
envisagez
la
question
sous
ce
point
de
vue

he
began
pronouncing
french
with
evident
difficulty
and
speaking
even
slower
than
in
russian
but
quite
calmly
.
sperdnski
went
on
to
say
that
honor
ihon
neur
cannot
be
upheld
by
privileges
harmful
to
the
service
that
honor
ihonneur
is
either
a
negative
concept
of
not
doing
what
is
blame
worthy
or
it
is
a
source
of
emulation
in
pursuit
of
commendation
and
rewards
which
recog
nize
it
.
his
arguments
were
concise
simple
and
clear
.
an
institution
upholding
honor
the
source
of
emulation
is
one
similar
to
the
legion
dhonneurot
the
great
emperor
napoleon
not
harmful
but
helpful
to
the
success
of
the
serv
ice
but
not
a
class
or
court
privilege
.
i
do
not
dispute
that
but
it
cannot
be
de
nied
that
court
privileges
have
attained
the
same
end
returned
prince
andrew
.
every
courtier
considers
himself
bound
to
maintain
his
position
worthily
.
yet
you
do
not
care
to
avail
yourself
of
the
privilege
prince
said
sperdnski
indicating
by
a
smile
that
he
wished
to
finish
amiably
an
argument
which
was
embarrassing
for
his
com
panion
.
if
you
will
do
me
the
honor
of
call
ing
on
me
on
wednesday
he
added
i
will
after
talking
with
magnitski
let
you
know
what
may
interest
you
and
shall
also
have
the
pleasure
of
a
more
detailed
chat
with
you
.
closing
his
eyes
he
bowed
a
la
franfaise
without
taking
leave
and
trying
to
attract
as
little
attention
as
possible
he
left
the
room
.
chapter
vi
during
the
first
weeks
of
his
stay
in
petersburg
prince
andrew
felt
the
whole
trend
of
thought
he
had
formed
during
his
life
of
seclusion
quite
1
the
principle
of

is
honor
seems
to
me
incontestable
.
certain
rights
and
privileges
for
the
aristocracy
appear
to
me
a
means
of
main
taining
that
sentiment

overshadowed
by
the
trifling
cares
that
en
grossed
him
in
that
city
.
on
returning
home
in
the
evening
he
would
jot
down
in
his
notebook
four
or
five
necessary
calls
or
appointments
for
certain
hours
.
the
mechanism
of
life
the
arrangement
of
the
day
so
as
to
be
in
time
everywhere
absorbed
the
greater
part
of
his
vital
energy
.
he
did
noth
ing
did
not
even
think
or
find
time
to
think
but
only
talked
and
talked
successfully
of
what
he
had
thought
while
in
the
country
.
he
sometimes
noticed
with
dissatisfaction
that
he
repeated
the
same
remark
on
the
same
day
in
different
circles
.
but
he
was
so
busy
for
whole
days
together
that
he
had
no
time
to
no
tice
that
he
was
thinking
of
nothing
.
as
he
had
done
on
their
first
meeting
at
ko
chubys
sperdnski
produced
a
strong
impres
sion
on
prince
andrew
on
the
wednesday
when
he
received
him
tthedtte
at
his
own
house
and
talked
to
him
long
and
confiden
tially
.
to
bolk6nski
so
many
people
appeared
con
temptible
and
insignificant
creatures
and
he
so
longed
to
find
in
someone
the
living
ideal
of
that
perfection
toward
which
he
strove
that
he
readily
believed
that
in
sperdnski
he
had
found
this
ideal
of
a
perfectly
rational
and
virtuous
man
.
had
sperdnski
sprung
from
the
same
class
as
himself
and
possessed
the
same
breed
ing
and
traditions
bolkonski
would
soon
have
discovered
his
weak
human
unheroic
sides
but
as
it
was
sperdnskis
strange
and
logical
turn
of
mind
inspired
him
with
respect
all
the
more
because
he
did
not
quite
understand
him
.
moreover
sperdnski
either
because
he
appre
ciated
the
others
capacity
or
because
he
con
sidered
it
necessary
to
win
him
to
his
side
showed
off
his
dispassionate
calm
reasonable
ness
before
prince
andrew
and
flattered
him
with
that
subtle
flattery
which
goes
hand
in
hand
with
selfassurance
and
consists
in
a
tacit
assumption
that
ones
companion
is
the
only
man
besides
oneself
capable
of
understanding
the
folly
of
the
rest
of
mankind
and
the
reason
ableness
and
profundity
of
ones
own
ideas
.
during
their
long
conversation
on

sperdnski
more
than
once
re

regard
everything
that
is

the

all
in
a
way
that
seemed
to

they
are
and

we

this
first
long
conversation

book
six
243
only
strengthened
in
prince
andrew
the
feel
ing
he
had
experienced
toward
him
at
their
first
meeting
.
he
saw
in
him
a
remarkable
clearthinking
man
of
vast
intellect
who
by
his
energy
and
persistence
had
attained
power
which
he
was
using
solely
for
the
welfare
of
russia
.
in
prince
andrews
eyes
sperdnski
was
the
man
he
would
himself
have
wished
to
be
one
who
explained
all
the
facts
of
life
reason
ably
considered
important
only
what
was
ra
tional
and
was
capable
of
applying
the
stand
ard
of
reason
to
everything
.
every
thing
seemed
so
simple
and
clear
in
sperdnskis
exposition
that
prince
andrew
involuntarily
agreed
with
him
about
everything
.
if
he
replied
and
ar
gued
it
was
only
because
he
wished
to
main
tain
his
independence
and
not
submit
to
spe
rdnskis
opinions
entirely
.
everything
was
right
and
everything
was
as
it
should
be
only
one
thing
disconcerted
prince
andrew
.
this
was
sperdnskis
cold
mirrorlike
look
which
did
not
allow
one
to
penetrate
to
his
soul
and
his
delicate
white
hands
which
prince
andrew
involuntarily
watched
as
one
does
watch
the
hands
of
those
who
possess
power
.
this
mirror
like
gaze
and
those
delicate
hands
irritated
prince
andrew
he
knew
not
why
.
he
was
un
pleasantly
struck
too
by
the
excessive
con
tempt
for
others
that
he
observed
in
sperdnski
and
by
the
diversity
of
lines
of
argument
he
used
to
support
his
opinions
.
he
made
use
of
every
kind
of
mental
device
except
analogy
and
passed
too
boldly
it
seemed
to
prince
an
drew
from
one
to
another
.
now
he
would
take
up
the
position
of
a
practical
man
and
con
demn
dreamers
now
that
of
a
satirist
and
laugh
ironically
at
his
opponents
now
grow
severely
logical
or
suddenly
rise
to
the
realm
of
metaphysics
.
this
last
resource
was
one
he
very
frequently
employed
.
he
would
transfer
a
question
to
metaphysical
heights
pass
on
to
definitions
of
space
time
and
thought
and
having
deduced
the
refutation
he
needed
would
again
descend
to
the
level
of
the
origi
nal
discussion
.
in
general
the
trait
of
sperdnskis
mentality
which
struck
prince
andrew
most
was
his
ab
solute
and
unshakable
belief
in
the
power
and
authority
of
reason
.
it
was
evident
that
the
thought
could
never
occur
to
him
which
to
prince
andrew
seemed
so
natural
namely
that
it
is
after
all
impossible
to
express
all
one
thinks
and
that
he
had
never
felt
the
doubt
is
not
all
i
think
and
believe
nonsense
and
it
was
just
this
peculiarity
of
sperdnskis
mind
that
particularly
attracted
prince
andrew
.
during
the
first
period
of
their
acquaintance
bolk6nski
felt
a
passionate
admiration
for
him
similar
to
that
which
he
had
once
felt
for
bonaparte
.
the
fact
that
sperdnski
was
the
son
of
a
village
priest
and
that
stupid
people
might
meanly
despise
him
on
account
of
his
humble
origin
as
in
fact
many
did
caused
prince
andrew
to
cherish
his
sentiment
for
him
the
more
and
unconsciously
to
strengthen
it
.
on
that
first
evening
bolk6nski
spent
with
him
having
mentioned
the
commission
for
the
revision
of
the
code
of
laws
sperdnski
told
him
sarcastically
that
the
commission
had
ex
isted
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
had
cost
millions
and
had
done
nothing
except
that
rosenkampf
had
stuck
labels
on
the
corre
sponding
paragraphs
of
the
different
codes
.
and
that
is
all
the
state
has
for
the
millions
it
has
spent
said
he
.
we
want
to
give
the
senate
new
juridical
powers
but
we
have
no
laws
.
that
is
why
it
is
a
sin
for
men
like
you
prince
not
to
serve
in
these
times
prince
andrew
said
that
for
that
work
an
education
in
jurisprudence
was
needed
which
he
did
not
possess
.
but
nobody
possesses
it
so
what
would
you
have
it
is
a
vicious
circle
from
which
we
must
break
a
way
out
.
a
week
later
prince
andrew
was
a
member
of
the
committee
on
army
regulations
and
what
he
had
not
at
all
expected
was
chairman
of
a
section
of
the
committee
for
the
revision
of
the
laws
.
at
sperdnskis
request
he
took
the
first
part
of
the
civil
code
that
was
being
drawn
up
and
with
the
aid
of
the
code
napo
teon
and
the
institutes
of
justinian
he
worked
at
formulating
the
section
on
personal
rights
.

pierre
on
returning
to
petersburg
after
visiting
his
estates
had
involuntarily
found
himself
in
a
leading
position
among
the
petersburg
free
masons
.
he
arranged
dining
and
funeral
lodge
meetings
enrolled
new
members
and
busied
himself
uniting
various
lodges
and
acquiring
authentic
charters
.
he
gave
money
for
the
erection
of
temples
and
supplemented
as
far
as
he
could
the
collection
of
alms
in
regard
to
which
the
majority
of
members
were
stingy
and
irregular
.
he
supported
almost
single
handed
a
poor
house
the
order
had
founded
in
petersburg
.
his
life
meanwhile
continued
as
before
with
the
same
infatuations
and
dissipations
.
he

war
and

liked
to
dine
and
drink
well
and
though
he
considered
it
immoral
and
humiliating
could
not
resist
the
temptations
of
the
bachelor
cir
cles
in
which
he
moved
.
amid
the
turmoil
of
his
activities
and
dis
tractions
however
pierre
at
the
end
of
a
year
began
to
feel
that
the
more
firmly
he
tried
to
rest
upon
it
the
more
masonic
ground
on
which
he
stood
gave
way
under
him
.
at
the
same
time
he
felt
that
the
deeper
the
ground
sank
under
him
the
closer
bound
he
involun
tarily
became
to
the
order
.
when
he
had
joined
the
freemasons
he
had
experienced
the
feel
ing
of
one
who
confidently
steps
onto
the
smooth
surface
of
a
bog
.
when
he
put
his
foot
down
it
sank
in
.
to
make
quite
sure
of
the
firmness
of
the
ground
he
put
his
other
foot
down
and
sank
deeper
still
became
stuck
in
it
and
involuntarily
waded
kneedeep
in
the
bog
joseph
alexevich
was
not
in
petersburg
he
had
of
late
stood
aside
from
the
affairs
of
the
petersburg
lodges
and
lived
almost
entirely
in
moscow
.
all
the
members
of
the
lodges
were
men
pierre
knew
in
ordinary
life
and
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
regard
them
merely
as
brothers
in
freemasonry
and
not
as
prince
b
.
or
ivdn
vasilevich
d
.
whom
he
knew
in
soci
ety
mostly
as
weak
and
insignificant
men
.
un
der
the
masonic
aprons
and
insignia
he
saw
the
uniforms
and
decorations
at
which
they
aimed
in
ordinary
life
.
often
after
collecting
alms
and
reckoning
up
twenty
to
thirty
rubles
received
for
the
most
part
in
promises
from
a
dozen
members
of
whom
half
were
as
well
able
to
pay
as
himself
pierre
remembered
the
masonic
vow
in
which
each
brother
promised
to
devote
all
his
belongings
to
his
neighbor
and
doubts
on
which
he
tried
not
to
dwell
arose
in
his
soul
.
he
divided
the
brothers
he
knew
into
four
categories
.
in
the
first
he
put
those
who
did
not
take
an
active
part
in
the
affairs
of
the
lodges
or
in
human
affairs
but
were
exclusive
ly
occupied
with
the
mystical
science
of
the
or
der
with
questions
of
the
threefold
designa
tion
of
god
the
three
primordial
elements
sulphur
mercury
and
salt
or
the
meaning
of
the
square
and
all
the
various
figures
of
the
temple
of
solomon
.
pierre
respected
this
class
of
brothers
to
which
the
elder
ones
chiefly
be
longed
including
pierre
thought
joseph
alexevich
himself
but
he
did
not
share
their
interests
.
his
heart
was
not
in
the
mystical
as
pect
of
freemasonry
.
in
the
second
category
pierre
reckoned
him
self
and
others
like
him
seeking
and
vacillat
ing
who
had
not
yet
found
in
freemasonry
a
straight
and
comprehensible
path
but
hoped
to
do
so
.
in
the
third
category
he
included
those
brothers
the
majority
who
saw
nothing
in
freemasonry
but
the
external
forms
and
cere
monies
and
prized
the
strict
performance
of
these
forms
without
troubling
about
their
pur
port
or
significance
.
such
were
willarski
and
even
the
grand
master
of
the
principal
lodge
.
finally
to
the
fourth
category
also
a
great
many
brothers
belonged
particularly
those
who
had
lately
joined
.
these
according
to
pierres
observations
were
men
who
had
no
be
lief
in
anything
nor
desire
for
anything
but
joined
the
freemasons
merely
to
associate
with
the
wealthy
young
brothers
who
were
influ
ential
through
their
connections
or
rank
and
of
whom
there
were
very
many
in
the
lodge
.
pierre
began
to
feel
dissatisfied
with
what
he
was
doing
.
freemasonry
at
any
rate
as
he
saw
it
here
sometimes
seemed
to
him
based
merely
on
externals
.
he
did
not
think
of
doubting
freemasonry
itself
but
suspected
that
russian
masonry
had
taken
a
wrong
path
and
deviated
from
its
original
principles
.
and
so
toward
the
end
of
the
year
he
went
abroad
to
be
initiated
into
the
higher
secrets
of
the
order
.
in
the
summer
of
1809
pierre
returned
to
petersburg
.
our
freemasons
knew
from
cor
respondence
with
those
abroad
that
beziikhov
had
obtained
the
confidence
of
many
highly
placed
persons
had
been
initiated
into
many
mysteries
had
been
raised
to
a
higher
grade
and
was
bringing
back
with
him
much
that
might
conduce
to
the
advantage
of
the
mason
ic
cause
in
russia
.
the
petersburg
freemasons
all
came
to
see
him
tried
to
ingratiate
them
selves
with
him
and
it
seemed
to
them
all
that
he
was
preparing
something
for
them
and
con
cealing
it
.
a
solemn
meeting
of
the
lodge
of
the
second
degree
was
convened
at
which
pierre
promised
to
communicate
to
the
petersburg
brothers
what
he
had
to
deliver
to
them
from
the
high
est
leaders
of
their
order
.
the
meeting
was
a
full
one
.
after
the
usual
ceremonies
pierre
rose
and
began
his
address
.
dear
brothers
he
began
blushing
and
stammering
with
a
written
speech
in
his
hand
it
is
not
sufficient
to
observe
our
mysteries
in
the
seclusion
of
our
lodge
we
must
act
act
we
are
drowsing
but
we
must
act
.
pierre
raised
his
notebook
and
began
to
read
.
for
the
dissemination
of
pure
truth
and
to
book

245
secure
the
triumph
of
virtue
he
read
we
must
cleanse
men
from
prejudice
diffuse
prin
ciples
in
harmony
with
the
spirit
of
the
times
undertake
the
education
of
the
young

ourselves
in
indissoluble
bonds
with
the
wisest
men
boldly
yet
prudently

supersti
tions

and
folly
and
form
of
those
devoted
to
us
a
body
linked
together
by
unity
of
purpose
and
possessed
of
authority
and
power
.
to
attain
this
end
we
must
secure
a
pre
ponderance
of
virtue
over
vice
and
must
en
deavor
to
secure
that
the
honest
man
may
even
in
this
world
receive
a
lasting
reward
for
his
virtue
.
but
in
these
great
endeavors
we
are
gravely
hampered
by
the
political
institutions
of
today
.
what
is
to
be
done
in
these
circum
stances
to
favor
revolutions
overthrow
every
thing
repel
force
by
force

.

.

.
no
i
we
are
very
far
from
that
.
every
violent
reform
deserves
censure
for
it
quite
fails
to
remedy
evil
while
men
remain
what
they
are
and
also
because
wisdom
needs
no
violence
.
the
whole
plan
of
our
order
should
be
based
on
the
idea
of
preparing
men
of
firm
ness
and
virtue
bound
together
by
unity
of
conviction
aiming
at
the
punishment
of
vice
and
folly
and
patronizing
talent
and
virtue
raising
worthy
men
from
the
dust
and
attach
ing
them
to
our
brotherhood
.
only
then
will
our
order
have
the
power
unobtrusively
to
bind
the
hands
of
the
protectors
of
disorder
and
to
control
them
without
their
being
aware
of
it
.
in
a
word
we
must
found
a
form
of
gov
ernment
holding
universal
sway
which
should
be
diffused
over
the
whole
world
without
de
stroying
the
bonds
of
citizenship
and
beside
which
all
other
governments
can
continue
in
their
customary
course
and
do
everything
ex
cept
what
impedes
the
great
aim
of
our
order
which
is
to
obtain
for
virtue
the
victory
over
vice
.
this
aim
was
that
of
christianity
itself
.
it
taught
men
to
be
wise
and
good
and
for
their
own
benefit
to
follow
the
example
and
instruction
of
the
best
and
wisest
men
.
at
that
time
when
everything
was
plunged
in
darkness
preaching
alone
was
of
course
suf
ficient
.
the
novelty
of
truth
endowed
her
with
special
strength
but
now
we
need
much
more
powerful
methods
.
it
is
now
necessary
that
man
governed
by
his
senses
should
find
in
virtue
a
charm
palpable
to
those
senses
.
it
is
impossible
to
eradicate
the
passions
but
we
must
strive
to
direct
them
to
a
noble
aim
and
it
is
therefore
necessary
that
everyone
should
be
able
to
satisfy
his
passions
within
the
limits
of
virtue
.
our
order
should
provide
means
to
that
end
.
as
soon
as
we
have
a
certain
number
of
worthy
men
in
every
state
each
of
them
again
training
two
others
and
all
being
closely
united
everything
will
be
possible
for
our
order
which
has
already
in
secret
accomplished
much
for
the
welfare
of
mankind
.
this
speech
not
only
made
a
strong
impres
sion
but
created
excitement
in
the
lodge
.
the
majority
of
the
brothers
seeing
in
it
dangerous
designs
of
illuminism

met
it
with
a
coldness
that
surprised
pierre
.
the
grand
master
be
gan
answering
him
and
pierre
began
develop
ing
his
views
with
more
and
more
warmth
.
it
was
long
since
there
had
been
so
stormy
a
meet
ing
.
parties
were
formed
some
accusing
pierre
of
illuminism
others
supporting
him
.
at
that
meeting
le
was
struck
for
the
first
time
by
the
endless
variety
of
mens
minds
which
prevents
a
truth
from
ever
presenting
itself
identically
to
two
persons
.
even
those
members
who
seemed
to
be
on
his
side
understood
him
in
their
own
way
with
limitations
and
alterations
he
could
not
agree
to
as
what
he
always
wanted
most
was
to
convey
his
thought
to
others
just
as
he
himself
understood
it
.
at
the
end
of
the

for
his
vehemence

it
was
not

of

but
also
a
love

strife
that
had
moved
him
in
the
dispute
.
pierre
did
not

him
and
asked
briefly
whether
his
pro
posal
would
be
accepted
.
he
was
told
that
it
would
not
and
without
waiting
for
the
usual
formalities
he
left
the
lodge
and
went
home
.
chapter

again
pierre
was
overtaken
by
the
depression
he
so
dreaded
.
for
three
days
after
the
delivery
of
his
speech
at
the
lodge
he
lay
on
a
sofa
at
home
receiving
no
one
and
going
nowhere
.
it
was
just
then
that
he
received
a
letter
from
his
wife
who
implored
him
to
see
her
telling
him
how
grieved
she
was
about
him
and
how
she
wished
to
devote
her
whole
life
to
him
.
at
the
end
of
the
letter
she
informed
him
that
in
a
few
days
she
would
return
to
peters
burg
from
abroad
.
following
this
letter
one
of
the
masonic
brothers
whom
pierre
respected
less
than
the
others
forced
his
way
in
to
see
him
and
turn

upon

the
opinion
that
his
severity
to
his
wife
was
wrong
and
that
he
was
neglecting
one

of
freemasonry
by
not
forgiving

.
at
the

time
his

sent
to
him
imploring
him
to
come
if
only
for
a
few
minutes
to
discuss
a
most
important
matter
.
pierre
saw
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
against
him
and
that
they
wanted
to
reunite
him
with
his
wife
and
in
the
mood
he
then
was
this

not

unpleasant
to
him

nothing

to
him

valued
neither

no
one
is
right
and
no
one
is
to
blame
so
she
too
is
not

he
thought
.
if
he
did
not
at
once
give
his
consent
to
a
reunion
with
his
wife
it
was
only
because
in
his
state
of
depression
he
did
not
feel
able
to
take
any
step

had
his

come
to
him

would
not

compared
to

preoccupied
him
was
it
not

pierre
late
one
night
prepared
for
a
journey
and
started
for
moscow
to
see
joseph
alexevich
.
this
is
what
he
noted
in
his
diary
moscow
ijth
november
i
have
just
returned
from
my
benefactor
and
hasten
to
write
down
what
i
have
experienced
.
joseph
alexevich
is
living
poorly
and
has
for
three
years
been
suffering
from
a
painful
disease
of
the
bladder
.
no
one
has
ever
heard
him
utter
a
groan
or
a
word
of
complaint
.
from
morning
till
late
at
night
except
when
he
eats
his
very
plain
food
he
is
working
at
science
.
he
received
me
graciously
and
made
me
sit
down
on
the
bed
on
which
he
lay
.
i
made
the
sign
of
the
knights
of
the
east
and
of
jerusalem
and
he
responded
in
the
same
manner
asking
me
with
a
mild
smile
what
i
had
learned
and
gained
in
the
prussian
and
scottish
lodges
.
i
told
him
everything
as
best
i
could
and
told
him
what
i
had
proposed
to
our
petersburg
lodge
of
the
bad
reception
i
had
en
countered
and
of
my
rupture
with
the
brothers
.
joseph
alexdevich
having
remained
silent
and
thoughtful
for
a
good
while
told
me
his
view
of
the
matter
which
at
once
lit
up
for
me
my
whole
past
and
the
future
path
i
should
follow
.
he
sur
prised
me
by
asking
whether
i
remembered
the
threefold
aim
of
the
order
i
the
preservation
and
study
of
the
mystery
a
the
purification
and
reformation
of
oneself
for
its
reception
and
3
the
improvement
of
the
human
race
by
striving
for
such
purification
.
which
is
the
principal
aim
of
these
three
certainly
selfreformation
and
self
purification
.
only
to
this
aim
can
we
always
strive
independently
of
circumstances
.
but
at
the
same
time
just
this
aim
demands
the
greatest
efforts
of
us
and
so
led
astray
by
pride
losing
sight
of
this
aim
we
occupy
ourselves
either
with
the
mystery
which
in
our
impurity
we
are
unworthy
to
receive
or
seek
the
reformation
of
the
human
race
while
ourselves
setting
an
example
of
baseness
and
prof
ligacy
.
ilium
inism
is
not
a
pure
doctrine
just
be
cause
it
is
attracted
by
social
activity
and
puffed
up
by
pride
.
on
this
ground
joseph
alexevich
condemned
my
speech
and
my
whole
activity
and
in
the
depth
of
my
soul
i
agreed
with
him
.
talk
ing
of
my
family
affairs
he
said
to
me
the
chief
duty
of
a
true
mason
as
i
have
told
you
lies
in
perfecting
himself
.
we
often
think
that
by
remov
ing
all
the
difficulties
of
our
life
we
shall
more
quickly
reach
our
aim
but
on
the
contrary
my
dear
sir
it
is
only
in
the
midst
of
worldly
cares
that
we
can
attain
our
three
chief
aims
i
selfknowl
edgefor
man
can
only
know
himself
by
compari
son
2
selfperfecting
which
can
only
be
attained
by
conflict
and
3
the
attainment
of
the
chief
virtue
love
of
death
.
only
the
vicissitudes
of
life
can
show
us
its
vanity
and
develop
our
innate
love
of
death
or
of
rebirth
to
a
new
life
.
these
words
are
all
the
more
remarkable
because
in
spite
of
his
great
physical
sufferings
joseph
alexeevich
is
never
weary
of
life
though
he
loves
death
for
which
in
spite
of
the
purity
and
loftiness
of
his
inner
man
he
does
not
yet
feel
himself
sufficiently
prepared
.
my
benefactor
then
explained
to
me
fully
the
meaning
of
the
great
square
of
creation
and
pointed
out
to
me
that
the
numbers
three
and
seven
are
the
basis
of
everything
.
he
advised
me
not
to
avoid
intercourse
with
the
petersburg
brothers
but
to
take
up
only
secondgrade
posts
in
the
lodge
to
try
while
diverting
the
brothers
from
pride
to
turn
them
toward
the
true
path
of
selfknowledge
and
selfperfecting
.
besides
this
he
advised
me
for
myself
personally
above
all
to
keep
a
watch
over
myself
and
to
that
end
he
gave
me
a
notebook
the
one
i
am
now
writing
in
and
in
which
i
will
in
future
note
down
all
my
actions
.
petersburg
2rd
november
i
am
again
living
with
my
wife
.
my
motherin
law
came
to
me
in
tears
and
said
that
helene
was
here
and
that
she
implored
me
to
hear
her
that
she
was
innocent
and
unhappy
at
my
desertion
and
much
more
.
i
knew
that
if
i
once
let
myself
see
her
i
should
not
have
strength
to
go
on
refus
ing
what
she
wanted
.
in
my
perplexity
i
did
not
know
whose
aid
and
advice
to
seek
.
had
my
bene
factor
been
here
he
would
have
told
me
what
to
do
.
i
went
to
my
room
and
reread
joseph
alexe
vichs
letters
and
recalled
my
conversations
with
him
and
deduced
from
it
all
that
i
ought
not
to
refuse
a
suppliant
and
ought
to
reach
a
helping
hand
to
everyone
especially
to
one
so
closely
bound
to
me
and
that
i
must
bear
my
cross
.
but
if
i
forgive
her
for
the
sake
of
doing
right
then
let
union
with
her
have
only
a
spiritual
aim
.
that
is
what
i
decided
and
what
i
wrote
to
joseph
alexeevich
.
i
told
my
wife
that
i
begged
her
to
forget
the
past
to
forgive
me
whatever
wrong
i
may
have
done
her
and
that
i
had
nothing
to
for
give
.
it
gave
me
joy
to
tell
her
this
.
she
need
not
know
how
hard
it
was
for
me
to
see
her
again
.
i
have
settled
on
the
upper
floor
of
this
big
house
and
am
experiencing
a
happy
feeling
of
regenera
tion
.
chapter
ix
at
that
time
as
always
happens
the
highest
society
that
met
at
court
and
at
the
grand
balls
was
divided
into
several
circles
each
with
its
own
particular
tone
.
the
largest
of
these
was
the
french
circle
of
the
napoleonic
alliance
the
circle

this
group

soon
as
she
had
settled

husband

a
very
prominent
place

she
was
visited
by
the
members
of
the
french
embassy
and
by
many
belonging
to
that
circle
and
noted
for
their
in

and
polished
manners

had

there

at

her
success
had
been
brilliant

her

her
success
as
a

woman
did
not
surprise
pierre
for
she
had
become
even
handsomer
than
before
.
what
did
surprise
him
was
that
during
these
last
two
years
his
wife
had
succeeded
in
gaining
the
reputation

over
every
word
of
hers
and
look
for
a
profound
meaning
in
it
of
which
she
herself
had
no
conception
.
pierre
was
just
the
husband
needed
for
a
brilliant
society
woman
.
he
was
that
absent
minded
crank
a
grand
seigneur
husband
who
was
in
no

way
and
far
from
spoiling
the
high
tone
and
general
impression
of
the

he
served
by
the
contrast
he
pre
sented
to
her
as
an
advantageous
background
to
his
elegant
and
tactful
wife
.
pierre
during
the
last
two
years
as
a
result
of
his
continual
absorption
in
abstract
interests
and
his
sincere
contempt
for
all
else
had
acquired
in
his
wifes
circle
which
did
not
interest
him
that
air
of
unconcern
indifference
and
benevolence
to
ward
all
which
cannot
be
acquired
artificially
and
therefore
inspires
involuntary
respect
.
he
entered
his
wifes

as
one
enters
a
theater
was
acquainted
with
everybody
equally
pleased
to
see
everyone
and
equally
in
different
to
them
all
.
sometimes
he
joined
in
a
conversation
which
interested
him
and
regard
less
of
whether
any
gentlemen
of
the
embassy
were
present
or
not
lispingly
expressed
his
views
which
were
sometimes
not
at
all
in
ac
cord
with
the
accepted
tone
of
the
moment
.
but
the
general
opinion
concerning
the
queer
husband
of
the
most
distinguished
woman
in
petersburg
was
so
well
established
that
no
one
took
his
freaks
seriously
.
among
the
many
young
men
who
frequented
her
house

day

had
already

was
the
most
intimate
friend
of
the
bezukhov
household
since
hlnes
return
from
erfurt
.
hlene
spoke
of
him
as
mon

and
treated
him
like

her
smile
for
him
was
the

that
smile

he
had
suffered
so
painfully
three
years
before
from
the
mortification
to
which
his
wife
had
subjected
him
that
he
now
protected
himself

danger
of

was

movements
.
what
a
strange
antipathy
thought
pierre
yet
i
used
to
like
him
very
much
.
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
pierre
was
a
great
gentleman
the
rather
blind
and
absurd
hus
band
of
a
distinguished
wife
a
clever
crank
who
did
nothing
but
harmed
nobody
and
was
a
firstrate
goodnatured
fellow
.
but
a
com
plex
and
difficult
process
of
internal
develop
ment
was
taking
place
all
this
time
in
pierres
soul
revealing
much
to
him
and
causing
him
many
spiritual
doubts

joys

we
had

about

they
laid
on
me
the
duty
of

i
feel
myself
weak

our
talk

in

evening
the
admission
took

the

of

contributed
much
to
the
magnificence
of
the
spectacle
.
it
was
borfs

who
was
ad
mitted
.
i
nominated
him
and
was
the
rhetor
.
a
strange
feeling
agitated
me
all
the
time
i
was
alone
with
him
in
the
dark
chamber
.
i
caught
my
self
harboring
a
feeling
of
hatred
toward
him
which
i
vainly
tried
to
overcome
.
that
is
why
i
should
really
like
to
save
him
from
evil
and
lead
him
into
the
path
of
truth
but
evil
thoughts
of
him
did
not
leave
me
.
it
seemed
to
me
that
his
ob
ject
in
entering
the
brotherhood
was
merely
to
be
intimate
and
in
favor
with
members
of
our
lodge
.
apart
from
the
fact
that
he
had
asked
me
several
times
whether
n

and
s
.
were
members
of
our
lodge
a
question
to
which
i
could
not
reply
and
that
according
to
my
observation
he
is
incapable
of
feeling
respect
for
our
holy
order
and
is
too
pre
occupied
and
satisfied
with
the
outer

i
had
no
cause
to
doubt
him
but
he
seemed
to
me
insincere
and
all
the
time
i
stood
alone
with
him
in
the
dark
tem

it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
smiling
con
temptuously
at
my
words
and
i
wished
really
to
stab
his

with
the

i
held
to
it

3rd
december
awoke
late
read
the
scriptures
but
was
apa
thetic
.
afterwards
went
and
paced
up
and
down
the
large
hall
.
i
wished
to
meditate
but
instead
my
imagination
pictured
an
occurrence
of
four
years
ago
when
d61okhov
meeting
me
in
moscow
after
our
duel
said
he
hoped
i
was
enjoying
per
fect
peace
of
mind
in
spite
of
my
wifes
absence
.
at
the
time
i
gave
him
no
answer
.
now
i
recalled
every
detail
of
that
meeting
and
in
my
mind
gave
him
the
most
malevolent
and
bitter
replies
.
i
rec
ollected
myself
and
drove
away
that
thought
only
when
i
found
myself
glowing
with
anger
but
i
did
not
sufficiently
repent
.
afterwards
boris
drubet
sk6y
came
and
began
relating
various
adventures
.
his
coming
vexed
me
from
the
first
and
i
said
something
disagreeable
to
him
.
he
replied
.
i
flared
up
and
said
much
that
was
unpleasant
and
even
rude
to
him
.
he
became
silent
and
i
recollected
myself
only
when
it
was
too
late
.
my
god
i
can
not
get
on
with
him
at
all
.
the
cause
of
this
is
my
egotism
.
i
set
myself
above
him
and
so
become
much
worse
than
he
for
he
is
lenient
to
my
rude
ness
while
i
on
the
contrary
nourish
contempt
for
him
.
o
god
grant
that
in
his
presence
i
may
rather
see
my
own
vileness
and
behave
so
that
he
too
may
benefit
.
after
dinner
i
fell
asleep
and
as
i
was
drowsing
off
i
clearly
heard
a
voice
saying
in
my
left
ear
thy
day
i
dreamed
that
i
was
walking
in
the
dark
and
was
suddenly
surrounded
by
dogs
but
i
went
on
undismayed
.
suddenly
a
smallish
dog
seized
my
left
thigh
with
its
teeth
and
would
not
let
go
.
i
began
to
throttle
it
with
my
hands
.
scarcely
had
i
torn
it
off
before
another
a
bigger
one
began
bit
ing
me
.
i
lifted
it
up
but
the
higher
i
lifted
it
the
bigger
and
heavier
it
grew
.
and
suddenly
brother
a
.
came
and
taking
my
arm
led
me
to
a
building
to
enter
which
we
had
to
pass
along
a
narrow
plank
.
i
stepped
on
it
but
it
bent
and
gave
way
and
i
began
to
clamber
up
a
fence
which
i
could
scarcely
reach
with
my
hands
.
after
much
effort
i
dragged
myself
up
so
that
my
legs
hung
down
on
one
side
and
my
body
on
the
other
.
i
looked
round
and
saw
brother
a
.
standing
on
the
fence
and
pointing
me
to
a
broad
avenue
and
garden
and
in
the
garden
was
a
large
and
beautiful
building
.
i
woke
up
.
o
lord
great
architect
of
nature
help
me
to
tear
from
myself
these
dogs
my
passions
especially
the
last
which
unites
in
itself
the
strength
of
all
the
former
ones
and
aid
me
to
enter
that
temple
of
virtue
to
a
vision
of
which
i
attained
in
my
dream
.
7th
december
i
dreamed
that
joseph
alexevich
was
sitting
in
my
house
and
that
i
was
very
glad
and
wished
to
entertain
him
.
it
seemed
as
if
i
chattered
inces
santly
with
other
people
and
suddenly
remem
bered
that
this
could
not
please
him
and
i
wished
to
come
close
to
him
and
embrace
him
.
but
as
soon
as
i
drew
near
i
saw
that
his
face
had
changed
and
grown
young
and
he
was
quietly
telling
me
something
about
the
teaching
of
our
order
but
so
softly
that
i
could
not
hear
it
.
then
it
seemed
that
we
all
left
the
room
and
something
strange
happened
.
we
were
sitting
or
lying
on
the
floor
.
he
was
telling
me
something
and
i
wished
to
show
him
my
sensibility
and
not
listening
to
what
he
was
saying
i
began
picturing
to
myself
the
condition
of
my
inner
man
and
the
grace
of
god
sanctifying
me
.
and
tears
came
into
my
eyes
and
i
was
glad
he
noticed
this
.
but
he
looked
at
me
with
vexation
and
jumped
up
breaking
off
his
re
marks
.
i
felt
abashed
and
asked
whether
what
he
had
been
saying
did
not
concern
me
but
he
did
not
reply
gave
me
a
kind
look
and
then
we
sud
denly
found
ourselves
in
my
bedroom
where
there
is
a
double
bed
.
he
lay
down
on
the
edge
of
it
and
i
burned
with
longing
to
caress
him
and
lie
down
too
.
and
he
said
tell
me
frankly
what
is
your
chief
temptation
do
you
know
it
i
think
you
know
it
already
.
abashed
by
this
question
i
re
plied
that
sloth
was
my
chief
temptation
.
he
shook
his
head
incredulously
and
even
more
abashed
i
said
that
though
i
was
living
with
my
wife
as
he
advised
i
was
not
living
with
her
as
her
husband
.
to
this
he
replied
that
one
should
not
deprive
a
wife
of
ones
embraces
and
gave
me
to
understand
that
that
was
my
duty
.
but
i
replied
that
i
should
be
ashamed
to
do
it
and
suddenly
everything
vanished
.
and
i
awoke
and
found
in
my
mind
the
text
from
the
gospel
the
life
was
the
light
of
men
.
and
the
light
shineth
in
dark
ness
and
the
darkness
comprehended
it
not
.
joseph
alexevichs
face
had
looked
young
and
bright
.
that
day
i
received
a
letter
from
my
bene
factor
in
which
he
wrote
about
conjugal
duties
.
9th
december
i
had
a
dream
from
which
i
awoke
with
a
throb
bing
heart
.
i
saw
that
i
was
in
moscow
in
my
house
in
the
big
sitting
room
and
joseph
alexevich
came
in
from
the
drawing
room
.
i
seemed
to
know
at
once
that
the
process
of
regeneration
had
al
ready
taken
place
in
him
and
i
rushed
to
meet
him
.
i
embraced
him
and
kissed
his
hands
and
he
said
hast
thou
noticed
that
my
face
is
dif
ferent
i
looked
at
him
still
holding
him
in
my
arms
and
saw
that
his
face
was
young
but
that
he
had
no
hair
on
his
head
and
his
features
were
quite
changed
.
and
i
said
i
should
have
known
you
had
i
met
you
by
chance
and
i
thought
to
myself
am
i
telling
the
truth
and
suddenly
i
saw
him
lying
like
a
dead
body
then
he
gradually
recovered
and
went
with
me
into
my
study
carry
ing
a
large
book
of
sheets
of
drawing
paper
i
said
i
drew
that
and
he
answered
by
bowing
his
head
.
i
opened
the
book
and
on
all
the
pages
there
were
excellent
drawings
.
and
in
my
dream
250
war
and
peace
i
knew
that
these
drawings
represented
the
love
adventures
of
the
soul
with
its
beloved
.
and
on
its
pages
i
saw
a
beautiful
representation
of
a
maiden
in
transparent
garments
and
with
a
transparent
body
flying
up
to
the
clouds
.
and
i
seemed
to
know
that
this
maiden
was
nothing
else
than
a
representation
of
the
song
of
songs
.
and
looking
at
those
drawings
i
dreamed
i
felt
that
i
was
do
ing
wrong
but
could
not
tear
myself
away
from
them
.

the
rosx6vs
monetary
affairs
had
not
im
proved
during
the
two
years
they
had
spent
in
the
country
.
though
nicholas
rostov
had
kept
firmly
to
his
resolution
and
was
still
serving
modestly
in
an
obscure
regiment
spending
comparatively
little
the
way
of
life
at
otradnoe
mftenkas
management
of
affairs
in
particular
was
such
that
the
debts
inevitably
increased
every
year
.
the
only
resource
obviously
presenting
itself
to
the
old
count
was
to
apply
for
an
official
post
so
he
had
come
to
petersburg
to
look
for
one
and
also
as
he
said
to
let
the
lassies
enjoy
themselves
for
the
last
time
.
soon
after
their
arrival
in
petersburg
berg
proposed
to
vera
and
was
accepted
.
though
in
moscow
the
rostovs
belonged
to
the
best
society
without
themselves
giving
it
a
thought
yet
in
petersburg
their
circle
of
ac
quaintances
was
a
mixed
and
indefinite
one
.
in
petersburg
they
were
provincials
and
the
very
people
they
had
entertained
in
moscow
without
inquiring
to
what
set
they
belonged
here
looked
down
on
them
.
the
rost6vs
lived
in
the
same
hospitable
way
in
petersburg
as
in
moscow
and
the
most
diverse
people
met
at
their
suppers

pierre
beziikhov
arid
the
son
of
their
district
postmaster
who
had
obtained
a
post
in
petersburg
.
among
the
men
who
very
soon
be
came
frequent
visitors
at
the
rost6vs
house
in
petersburg
were
boris
pierre
whom
the
count
had
met
in
the
street
and
dragged
home
with
him
and
berg
who
spent
whole
days
at
the
rost6vs
and
paid
the
eldest
daughter
count
ess
vera
the
attentions
a
young
man
pays
when
he
intends
to
propose
.
not
in
vain
had
berg
shown
everybody
his
right
hand
wounded
at
austerlitz
and
held
a
perfectly
unnecessary
sword
in
his
left
.
he
nar
rated
that
episode
so
persistently
and
with
st
important
an
air
that
everyone
believed
in
the
merit
and
usefulness
of
his
deed
and
he
had
obtained
two
decorations
for
austerlitz
.
in
the
finnish
war
he
also
managed
to
dis
tinguish
himself
.
he
had
picked
up
the
scrap
of
a
grenade
that
had
killed
an
aidedecamp
standing
near
the
commander
in
chief
and
had
taken
it
to
his
commander
.
just
as
he
had
done
after
austerlitz
he
related
this
occurrence
at
such
length
and
so
insistently
that
everyone
again
believed
it
had
been
necessary
to
do
this
and
he
received
two
decorations
for
the
fin
nish
war
also
.
in
1809
he
was
a
captain
in
the
guards
wore
medals
and
held
some
special
lucrative
posts
in
petersburg
.
though
some
skeptics
smiled
when
told
of
bergs
merits
it
could
not
be
denied
that
he
was
a
painstaking
and
brave
officer
on
excel
lent
terms
with
his
superiors
and
a
moral
young
man
with
a
brilliant
career
before
him
and
an
assured
position
in
society
.
four
years
before
meeting
a
german
com
rade
in
the
stalls
of
a
moscow
theater
berg
had
pointed
out
vera
rost6va
to
him
and
had
said
in
german
das
soil
mein
weib
werden
1
and
from
that
moment
had
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
her
.
now
in
petersburg
having
con
sidered
the
rost6vs
position
and
his
own
he
decided
that
the
time
had
come
to
propose
.
bergs
proposal
was
at
first
received
with
a
perplexity
that
was
not
flattering
to
him
.
at
first
it
seemed
strange
that
the
son
of
an
ob
scure
livonian
gentleman
should
propose
mar
riage
to
a
countess
rost6va
but
bergs
chief
characteristic
was
such
a
naive
and
goocl
natured
egotism
that
the
rost6vs
involuntarily
came
to
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
since
he
himself
was
so
firmly
convinced
that
it
was
good
indeed
excellent
.
moreover
the
rostovs
affairs
were
seriously
embarrassed
as
the
suitor
could
not
but
know
and
above
all
vera
was
twentyfour
had
been
taken
out
everywhere
and
though
she
was
certainly
goodlooking
and
sensible
no
one
up
to
now
had
proposed
to
her
.
so
they
gave
their
consent
.
you
see
said
berg
to
his
comrade
whom
he
called
friend
only
because
he
knew
that
everyone
has
friends
you
see
i
have
consid
ered
it
all
and
should
not
marry
if
i
had
not
thought
it
all
out
or
if
it
were
in
any
way
un
suitable
.
but
on
the
contrary
my
papa
and
mamma
are
now
provided
for
i
have
arranged
that
rent
for
them
in

my

she
has
con
nections
and
some
means

in
our
times
that

worth
something
isnt
it
but
above
all
she
is
a
handsome
estimable
girl
and
she
loves
me
.

.

.
berg
blushed
and
smiled
.
and
i
love
her
because
her
character
is
sensible
and
very
good
.
now
the
other
sister
though
they
are
the
same

is
quite
dif
ferentan
unpleasant
character
and
has
not
the
same
intelligence
.
she
is
so

..
.
you
know

.

.

.
unpleasant

.

.

.
but
my
fiancee

.

.

.
well
you
will
be
coming
he
was
going
to
say
to
dine
but
changed
his
mind
and
said
to
take
tea
with
us
and
quickly
doubling
up
his
tongue
he
blew
a
small
round
ring
of
tobacco
smoke
perfectly
embodying
his
dream
of
hap
piness
.
after
the
first
feeling
of
perplexity
aroused
in
the
parents
by
bergs
proposal
the
holiday
tone
of
joyousness
usual
at
such
times
took
pos
session
of
the
family
but
the
rejoicing
was
ex
ternal
and
insincere
.
in
the
familys
feeling
to
ward
this
wedding
a
certain
awkwardness
and
constraint
was
evident
as
if
they
were
ashamed
of
not
having
loved
vera
sufficiently
and
of
be
ing
so
ready
to
get
her
off
their
hands
.
the
old
count
felt
this
most
.
he
would
probably
have
been
unable
to
state
the
cause
of
his
embarrass
ment
but
it
resulted
from
the
state
of
his
af
fairs
.
he
did
not
know
at
all
how
much
he
had
what
his
debts
amounted
to
or
what
dowry
he
could
give
v6ra
.
when
his
daughters
were
born
he
had
assigned
to
each
of
them
for
her
dowry
an
estate
with
three
hundred
serfs
but
one
of
these
estates
had
already
been
sold
and
the
other
was
mortgaged
and
the
interest
so
much
in
arrears
that
it
would
have
to
be
sold
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
give
it
to
vera
.
nor
had
he
any
money
.
berg
had
already
been
engaged
a
month
and
only
a
week
remained
before
the
wedding
but
the
count
had
not
yet
decided
in
his
own
mind
the
question
of
the
dowry
nor
spoken
to
hiswifeabout
it
.
atone
time
the
count
thought
of
giving
her
the
ryazan
estate
or
of
selling
a
forest
at
another
time
of
borrowing
money
on
a
note
of
hand
.
a
few
days
before
the
wedding
berg
entered
the
counts
study
early
one
morn
ing
and
with
a
pleasant
smile
respectfully
asked
his
future
fatherinlaw
to
let
him
know
book
six
251
what
wras
dowry
would
be
.
the
count
was
so
disconcerted
by
this
longforeseen
inquiry
that
without
consideration
he
gave
the
first
reply
that
came
into
his
head
.
i
like
your
being
busi
nesslike
about
it
.

..
.
i
like
it
.
you
shall
be
satisfied
.

.

.

.
and
patting
berg
on
the
shoulder
he
got
up
wishing
to
end
the
conversation
.
but
berg
smiling
pleasantly
explained
that
if
he
did
not
know
for
certain
how
much
vra
would
have
and
did
not
receive
at
least
part
of
the
dowry
in
advance
he
would
have
to
break
matters
off
.
because
consider
count
if
i
allowed
my
self
to
marry
now
without
having
definite
means
to
maintain
my
wife
i
should
be
acting
badly

the
conversation
ended
by
the
count
who
wished
to
be
generous
and
to
avoid
further
im
portunity
saying
that
he
would
give
a
note
of
hand
for
eighty
thousand
rubles
.
berg
smiled
meekly
kissed
the
count
on
the
shoulder
and
said
that
he
was
very
grateful
but
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
arrange
his
new
life
with
out
receiving
thirty
thousand
in
ready
money
.
or
at
least
twenty
thousand
count
he
added
and
then
a
note
of
hand
for
only
sixty
thou
sand
.
yes
yes
all
rightl
said
the
count
hurried
ly
.
only
excuse
me
my
dear
fellow
ill
give
you
twenty
thousand
and
a
note
of
hand
for
eighty
thousand
as
well
.
yes
yes
kiss
me
.
chapter
xii
natasha
was
sixteen
and
it
was
the
year
1809
the
very
year
to
which
she
had
counted
on
her
fingers
with
boris
after
they
had
kissed
four
years
ago
.
since
then
she
had
not
seen
him
.
be
fore
s6nya
and
her
mother
if
boris
happened
to
be
mentioned
she
spoke
quite
freely
of
that
episode
as
of
some
childish
longforgotten
mat
ter
that
was
not
worth
mentioning
.
but
in
the
secret
depths
of
her
soul
the
question
whether
her
engagement
to
boris
was
a
jest
or
an
im
portant
binding
promise
tormented
her
.
since
boris
left
moscow
in
1805
to
join
the
army
he
had
not
seen
the
rostovs
.
he
had
been
in
moscow
several
times
and
had
passed
near
otradnoe
but
had
never
been
to
see
them
.
sometimes
it
occurred
to
natdsha
that
he
did
not
wish
to
see
her
and
this
conjecture
was
confirmed
by
the
sad
tone
in
which
her
elders
spoke
of
him
.
nowadays
old
friends
are
not
remembered
the
countess
would
say
when
borfs
was
men
tioned
.
anna
mikhaylovna
also
had
of
late
visited
252
war
and
peace
them
less
frequently
seemed
to
hold
herself
with
particular
dignity
and
always
spoke
rap
turously
and
gratefully
of
the
merits
of
her
son
and
the
brilliant
career
on
which
he
had
en
tered
.
when
the
rost6vs
came
to
petersburg
boris
called
on
them
.
he
drove
to
their
house
in
some
agitation
.
the
memory
of
natasha
was
his
most
poetic
recollection
.
but
he
went
with
the
firm
inten
tion
of
letting
her
and
her
parents
feel
that
the
childish
relations
between
himself
and
natasha
could
not
be
binding
either
on
her
or
on
him
.
he
had
a
brilliant
position
in
society
thanks
to
his
intimacy
with
countess
bezukhova
a
bril
liant
position
in
the
service
thanks
to
the
pat
ronage
of
an
important
personage
whose
com
plete
confidence
he
enjoyed
and
he
was
begin
ning
to
make
plans
for
marrying
one
of
the
richest
heiresses
in
petersburg
plans
which
might
very
easily
be
realized
.
when
he
entered
the
rost6vs
drawing
room
natdsha
was
in
her
own
room
.
when
she
heard
of
his
arrival
she
almost
ran
into
the
drawing
room
flushed
and
beaming
with
a
more
than
cordial
smile
.
boris
remembered
natasha
in
a
short
dress
with
dark
eyes
shining
from
under
her
curls
and
boisterous
childish
laughter
as
he
had
known
her
four
years
before
and
so
he
was
tak
en
aback
when
quite
a
different
natasha
en
tered
and
his
face
expressed
rapturous
aston
ishment
.
this
expression
on
his
face
pleased
natasha
.
well
do
you
recognize
your
little
madcap
playmate
asked
the
countess
.
boris
kissed
natdshas
hand
and
said
that
he
was
astonished
at
the
change
in
her
.
how
handsome
you
have
grown
i
should
think
sol
replied
natdshas
laugh
ing
eyes
.
and
is
papa
older
she
asked
.
natdsha
sat
down
and
without
joining
in
boris
conversation
with
the
countess
silently
and
minutely
studied
her
childhoods
suitor
.
he
felt
the
weight
of
that
resolute
and
affec
tionate
scrutiny
and
glanced
at
her
occasional
ly
.
boris
uniform
spurs
tie
and
the
way
his
hair
was
brushed
were
all
comme
il
faut
and
in
the
latest
fashion
.
this
natdsha
noticed
at
once
.
he
sat
rather
sideways
in
the
armchair
next
to
the
countess
arranging
with
his
right
hand
the
cleanest
of
gloves
that
fitted
his
left
hand
like
a
skin
and
he
spoke
with
a
particu
larly
refined
compression
of
his
lips
about
the
amusements
of
the
highest
petersburg
society
recalling
with
mild
irony
old
times
in
mos
cow
and
moscow
acquaintances
.
it
was
not
accidentally
natasha
felt
that
he
alluded
when
speaking
of
the
highest
aristocracy
to
an
ambassadors
ball
he
had
attended
and
to
in
vitations
he
had
received
from
n
.n
.
and
s
.s
.
all
this
time
natdsha
sat
silent
glancing
up
at
him
from
under
her
brows
.
this
gaze
dis
turbed
and
confused
boris
more
and
more
.
he
looked
round
more
frequently
toward
her
and
broke
off
in
what
he
was
saying
.
he
did
not
stay
more
than
ten
minutes
then
rose
and
took
his
leave
.
the
same
inquisitive
challenging
and
rather
mocking
eyes
still
looked
at
him
.
after
his
first
visit
boris
said
to
himself
that
na
tdsha
attracted
him
just
as
much
as
ever
but
that
he
must
not
yield
to
that
feeling
because
to
marry
her
a
girl
almost
without
fortune
would
mean
ruin
to
his
career
while
to
renew
their
former
relations
without
intending
to
marry
her
would
be
dishonorable
.
boris
made
up
his
mind
to
avoid
meeting
natdsha
but
de
spite
that
resolution
he
called
again
a
few
days
later
and
began
calling
often
and
spending
whole
days
at
the
rost6vs
.
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
ought
to
have
an
explanation
with
na
tdsha
and
tell
her
that
the
old
times
must
be
forgotten
that
in
spite
of
everything

.

.

.
she
could
not
be
his
wife
that
he
had
no
means
and
they
would
never
let
hermarryhim
.
but
he
failed
to
do
so
and
felt
awkward
about
enter
ing
on
such
an
explanation
.
from
day
to
day
he
became
more
and
more
entangled
.
it
seemed
to
her
mother
and
s6nya
that
natdsha
was
in
love
with
boris
as
of
old
.
she
sang
him
his
fa
vorite
songs
showed
him
her
album
making
him
write
in
it
did
not
allow
him
to
allude
to
the
past
letting
it
be
understood
how
delight
ful
was
the
present
and
every
day
he
went
away
in
a
fog
without
having
said
what
he
meant
to
and
not
knowing
what
he
was
doing
or
why
he
came
or
how
it
would
alf
end
.
he
left
off
visit
ing
hdlene
and
received
reproachful
notes
from
her
every
day
and
yet
he
continued
to
spend
whole
days
with
the
rost6vs
.
chapter
xiii
one
night
when
the
old
countess
in
nightcap
and
dressing
jacket
without
her
false
curls
and
with
her
poor
little
knob
of
hair
showing
under
her
white
cotton
cap
knelt
sighing
and
groaning
on
a
rug
and
bowing
to
the
ground
in
prayer
her
door
creaked
and
natdsha
also
in
a
dressing
jacket
with
slippers
on
her
bare
feet
and
her
hair
in
curlpapers
ran
in
.
the
countess
her
prayerful
mood
dispelled
looked
round
and
frowned
.
she
was
finishing
her
last
prayer
can
it
be
that
this
couch
will
be
my
grave
natasha
flushed
and
eager
seeing
her
mother
in
prayer
suddenly
checked
her
rush
half
sat
down
and
unconsciously
put
out
her
tongue
as
if
chiding
herself
.
seeing
that
her
mother
was
still
praying
she
ran
on
tiptoe
to
the
bed
and
rapidly
slipping
one
little
foot
against
the
other
pushed
off
her
slippers
and
jumped
onto
the
bed
the
countess
had
feared
might
become
her
grave
.
this
couch
was
high
with
a
feather
bed
and
five
pillows
each
small
er
than
the
one
below
.
natasha
jumped
on
it
sank
into
the
feather
bed
rolled
over
to
the
wall
and
began
snuggling
up
the
bedclothes
as
she
settled
down
raising
her
knees
to
her
chin
kicking
out
and
laughing
almost
inaudi
bly
now
covering
herself
up
head
and
all
and
now
peeping
at
her
mother
.
the
countess
finished
her
prayers
and
came
to
the
bed
with
a
stern
face
but
seeing
that
natashas
head
was
covered
she
smiled
in
her
kind
weak
way
.
now
then
now
then
said
she
.
mamma
can
we
have
a
talk
yes
said
na
tasha
.
now
just
one
on
your
throat
and
an
other

.

.

.
thatll
do
and
seizing
her
mother
round
the
neck
she
kissed
her
on
the
throat
.
in
her
behavior
to
her
mother
natasha
seemed
rough
but
she
was
so
sensitive
and
tactful
that
however
she
clasped
her
mother
she
always
managed
to
do
it
without
hurting
her
or
mak
ing
her
feel
uncomfortable
or
displeased
.
well
what
is
it
tonight
said
the
mother
having
arranged
her
pillows
and
waited
until
natdsha
after
turning
over
a
couple
of
times
had
settled
down
beside
her
under
the
quilt
spread
out
her
arms
and
assumed
a
serious
ex
pression
.
these
visits
of
natashas
at
night
before
the
count
returned
from
his
club
were
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
of
both
mother
and
daugh
ter
.
what
is
it
tonight
but
i
have
to
tell
you

..
.
natdsha
put
her
hand
on
her
mothers
mouth
.
about
boris

..
.
i
know
she
said
seriously
thats
what
i
have
come
about
.
dont
say
it
i
know
.
no
do
tell
me
and
she
removed
her
hand
.
tell
me
mamma
hes
nice
natasha
you
are
sixteen
.
at
your
age
i
was
married
.
you
say
boris
is
nice
.
he
is
very
nice
and
i
love
him
like
a
son
.
but
what
then

.

.

.
what
are
you
thinking
about
you
have
quite
turned
his
head
i
can
see
that
.

.

.

.
as
she
said
this
the
countess
looked
round
at
her
daughter
.
natdsha
was
lying
looking
book
six
253
steadily
straight
before
her
at
one
of
the
ma
hogany
sphinxes
carved
on
the
corners
of
the
bedstead
so
that
the
countess
only
saw
her
daughters
face
in
profile
.
that
face
struck
her
by
its
peculiarly
serious
and
concentrated
ex
pression
.
natdsha
was
listening
and
considering
.
well
what
then
said
she
.
you
have
quite
turned
his
head
and
why
what
do
you
want
of
him
you
know
you
cant
marry
him
.
why
not
said
natdsha
without
changing
her
position
.
because
he
is
young
because
he
is
poor
be
cause
he
is
a
relation

.

.

.
and
because
you
your
self
dont
love
him
.
how
do
you
know
i
know
.
it
is
not
right
darling
but
if
i
want
to

.

.

said
natdsha
.
leave
off
talking
nonsense
said
the
count
ess
.
but
if
i
want
to

.

.

.
natdsha
i
am
in
earnest

.

.

.
natdsha
did
not
let
her
finish
.
she
drew
the
countess
large
hand
to
her
kissed
it
on
the
back
and
then
on
the
palm
then
again
turned
it
over
and
began
kissing
first
one
knuckle
then
the
space
between
the
knuckles
then
the
next
knuckle
whispering
january
february
march
april
may
.
speak
mamma
why
dont
you
say
anything
speak
said
she
turning
to
her
mother
who
was
tenderly
gazing
at
her
daughter
and
in
that
contemplation
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
she
had
witffcto
say
.
it
wont
do
my
love
not
everyone
will
un
derstand
this
friendship
dating
from
your
childish
days
and
to
see
him
so
intimate
with
you
may
injure
you
in
the
eyes
of
other
young
men
who
visit
us
and
above
all
it
torments
him
for
nothing
.
he
may
already
have
found
a
suitable
and
wealthy
match
and
now
hes
half
crazy
.
crazy
repeated
natdsha
.
ill

you
some
things
about
myself
.
i
had
a
cousin

.

.

.
i
know

but

she
seized

from

door
.

natdsha
jumped
up
snatched
up
her
slippers
and
ran
barefoot
to
her
own
room
.
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
could
sleep
.
she
kept
thinking
that
no
one
could
under
stand
all
that
she
understood
and
all
there
was
in
her
.
s6nya
she
thought
glancing
at
that
curled
up
sleeping
little
kitten
with
her
enormous
plait
of
hair
.
no
how
could
she
shes
virtu
ous
.
she
fell
in
love
with
nicholas
and
does
not
wish
to
know
anything
more
.
even
mam
ma
does
not
understand
.
it
is
wonderful
how
clever
i
am
and
how

.

.

.
charming
she
is
she
went
on
speaking
of
herself
in
the
third
per
son
and
imagining
it
was
some
very
wise
man
the
wisest
and
best
of
men
who
was
saying
it
of
her
.
there
is
everything
everything
in
her
continued
this
man
.
she
is
unusually
in
telligent
charming

.

.

.
and
then
she
is
pretty
uncommonly
pretty
and
agile
she
swims
and
rides
splendidly

.

.

.
and
her
voice
one
can
really
say
its
a
wonderful
voice
1
she
hummed
a
scrap
from
her
favorite
opera
by
cherubini
threw
herself
on
her
bed
laughed
at
the
pleasant
thought
that
she
would
imme
diately
fall
asleep
called
dunydsha
the
maid
to
put
out
the
candle
and
before
dunydsha
had
left
the
room
had
already
passed
into
yet
another
happier
world
of
dreams
where
every
thing
was
as
light
and
beautiful
as
in
reality
and
even
more
so
because
it
was
different
.
next
day
the
countess
called
boris
aside
and
had
a
talk
with
him
after
which
he
ceased
com
ing
to
the
rost6vs
.

an

was
giving
a
ball
and
midnight
supper
.
the
diplomatic
corps
and
the
emperor
himself
were
to
be
present
.
the
grandees
wellknown
mansion
on
the
english
quay
glittered
with
innumerable
lights
.
police
were
stationed
at
the
brightly
lit
en
trance
which
was
carpeted
with
red
baize
and
not
only
gendarmes
but
dozens
of
police
of
ficers
and
even
the
police
master
himself
stood
at
the
porch
.
carriages
kept
driving
away
and
fresh
ones
arriving
with
redliveried
footmen
and
footmen
in
plumed
hats
.
from
the
car
riages
emerged
men
wearing
uniforms
stars
and
ribbons
while
ladies
in
satin
and
ermine
cautiously
descended
the
carriage
steps
which
were
let
down
for
them
with
a
clatter
and
then
walked
hurriedly
and
noiselessly
over
the
baize
at
the
entrance
.
almost
every
time
a
new
carriage
drove
up
a
whisper
ran
through
the
crowd
and
caps
were
doffed
.
the

was
whispered
among
the
crowd
.
one
person
better
dressed
than
the
rest
seemed
to
know
everyone
and
mentioned
by
name
the
greatest
dignitaries
of
the
day
.
a
third
of
the
visitors
had
already
arrived
but
the
rost6vs
who
were
to
be
present
were
still
hurrying
to
get
dressed
.
there
had
been
many
discussions
and
prepa
rations
for
this
ball
in
the
rost6v
family
many
fears
that
the
invitation
would
not
arrive
that
the
dresses
would
not
be
ready
or
that
some
thing
would
not
be
arranged
as
it
should
be
.
mdrya

a
thin
and
shallow
maid
of
honor
at
the
court
of
the
dow
ager

who
was
a
friend
and
relation
of
the
countess
and
piloted

high
society
was
to
accompany
them
to
the
ball
.
they
were
to
call
for
her
at
her
house
in
the
taurida
gardens
at
ten
oclock
but
it
was
al
ready
five
minutes
to
ten
and
the
girls
were
not
yet
dressed
.
natasha
was
going
to
her
first
grand
ball
.
she
had
got
up
at
eight
that
morning
and
had
been
in
a
fever
of
excitement
and
activity
all
day
.
all
her
powers
since
morning
had
been
con
centrated
on
ensuring
that
they
all
she
her
self
mamma
and
s6nya
should
be
as
well
dressed
as
possible
.
s6nya
and
her
mother
put
themselves
entirely
in
her
hands
.
the
countess
was
to
wear
a
claretcolored
velvet
dress
and
the
two
girls
white
gauze
over
pink
silk
slips
with
roses
on
their
bodices
and
their
hair
dressed

in
grecque
.
everything
essential
had
already
been
done
feet
hands
necks
and
ears
washed
perfumed
and
powdered
as
befits
a
ball
the
openwork
silk
stockings
and
white
satin
shoes
with
rib
bons
were
already
on
the
hairdressing
was
al
most
done
.
s6nya
was
finishing
dressing
and
so
was
the
countess
but
natasha
who
had
bustled
about
helping
them
all
was
behindhand
.
she
was
still
sitting
before
a
lookingglass
with
a
dressing
jacket
thrown
over
her
slender
shoul
ders
.
s6nya
stood
ready
dressed
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
pressing
the
head
of
a
pin
till
it
hurt
her
dainty
finger
was
fixingon
a
lastrib
bon
that
squeaked
as
the
pin
went
through
it
.
thats
not
the
way
thats
not
the
way
s6nya
cried
natdsha
turning
her
head
and
clutching
with
both
hands
at
her
hair
which
the
maid
who
was
dressing
it
had
not
time
to
release
.
that
bow
is
not
right
.
come
here
s6nya
sat
down
and
natdsha
pinned
the
rib
bon
on
differently
.
allow
me
missl
i
cant
do
it
like
that
said
the
maid
who
was
holding
natashas
hair
.
oh
dearl
well
then
wait
.
thats
right
s6nya
.
arent
you
ready
it
is
nearly
ten
came
the
countess
voice
.
directly
directly
and
you
mamma
i
have
only
my
cap
to
pin
on
.
dont
do
it
without
me
called
natdsha
.
you
wont
do
it
right
.
but
its
already
ten
.
they
had
decided
to
be
at
the
ball
by
half
past
ten
and
natdsha
had
still
to
get
dressed
and
they
had
to
call
at
the
taurida
gardens
.
when
her
hair
was
done
natasha
in
her
short
petticoat
from
under
which
her
dancing
shoes
showed
and
in
her
mothers
dressing
jacket
ran
up
to
s6nya
scrutinized
her
and
then
ran
to
her
mother
.
turning
her
mothers
head
this
way
and
that
she
fastened
on
the
cap
and
hurriedly
kissing
her
gray
hair
ran
back
to
the
maids
who
were
turning
up
the
hem
of
her
skirt
.
the
cause
of
the
delay
was
natashas
skirt
which
was
too
long
.
two
maids
were
turning
up
the
hem
and
hurriedly
biting
off
the
ends
of
thread
.
a
third
with
pins
in
her
mouth
was
running
about
between
the
countess
and
s6n
ya
and
a
fourth
held
the
whole
of
the
gossa
mer
garment
up
high
on
one
uplifted
hand
.
mdvra
quicker
darling
give
me
my
thimble
miss

there

.

.

.
whenever

ready
asked
the
count
coming
to
the
door
.
here

some
scent
.
per6nskaya
must
be
tired
of
waiting
.
its
ready
miss
said
the
maid
holding
up
the
shortened
gauze
dress
with
two
fingers
and
blowing
arid
shaking
something
off
it
as
if
by
this
to
express
a
consciousness
of
the
airiness
and
purity
of
what
she
held
.
natdsha
began
putting
on
the
dress
.
in
a
minute
in
a
minute
dont
come
in
papa
she
cried
to
her
father
as
he
opened
the
door
speaking
from
under
the
filmy
skirt
which
still
covered
her
whole
face
.
sonya
slammed
the
door
to
.
a
minute
later
they
let
the
count
in
.
he
was
wearing
a
blue
swallowtail
coat
shoes
and
stockings
and
was
perfumed
and
his
hair
pomaded
.
oh
papal
how
nice
you
look
charming
cried
natasha
as
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
smoothing
out
the
folds
of
the
gauze
.
if
you
please
miss
allow
me
said
the
maid
who
on
her
knees
was
pulling
the
skirt
straight
and
shifting
the
pins
from
one
side
of
her
mouth
to
the
other
with
her
tongue
.
say
what
you
like
exclaimed
s6nya
in
a
despairing
voice
as
she
looked
at
natdsha
say
what
you
like
its
still
too
long
.
natdsha
stepped
back
to
look
at
herself
in
the
pier
glass
.
the
dress
was
too
long
.
really
madam
it
is
not
at
all
too
long
said
mdvra
crawling
on
her
knees
after
her
young
lady
.
well
if
its
too
long
well
take
it
up

..
.
well
tack
it
up
in
one
minute
said
the
reso
lute
dunydsha
taking
a
needle
that
was
stuck
on
the
front
of
her
little
shawl
and
still
kneel
ing
on
the
floor
set
to
work
once
more
.
at
that
moment
with
soft
steps
the
count
ess
came
in
shyly
in
her
cap
and
velvet
gown
.
oooo
my
beauty
exclaimed
the
count
she
looks
better
than
any
of
you
war
and
peace
he
would
have
embraced
her
but
blushing
she
stepped
aside
fearing
to
be
rumpled
.
mamma
your
cap
more
to
this
side
said
natdsha
.
ill
arrange
it
and
she
rushed
for
ward
so
that
the
maids
who
were
tacking
up
her
skirt
could
not
move
fast
enough
and
a
piece
of
gauze
was
torn
off
.
oh
goodness
what
has
happened
really
it
was
not
my
fault
i

never
mind
ill
run
it
up
it
wont
show
said
dunydsha
.
what
a
beauty
a
very
queen
said
the
nurse
as
she
came
to
the
door
.
and
s6nya
they
are
lovely
i
at
a
quarter
past
ten
they
at
last
got
into
their
carriages
and
started
.
but
they
had
still
to
call
at
the
taurida
gardens
.
per6nskaya
was
quite
ready
.
in
spite
of
her
age
and
plainness
she
had
gone
through
the
same
process
as
the
rost6vs
but
with
less
flur
ryfor
to
her
it
was
a
matter
of
routine
.
her
ugly
old
body
was
washed
perfumed
and
pow
dered
in
just
the
same
way
.
she
had
washed
be
hind
her
ears
just
as
carefully
and
when
she
entered
her
drawing
room
in
her
yellow
dress
wearing
her
badge
as
maid
of
honor
her
old
ladys
maid
was
as
full
of
rapturous
admira
tion
as
the
rost6vs
servants
had
been
.
she
praised
the
rost6vs
toilets
.
they
praised
her
taste
and
toilet
and
at
eleven
oclock
care
ful
of
their
coiffures
and
dresses
they
settled
themselves
in
their
carriages
and
drove
off
.
chapter
xv
natasha
had
not
had
a
moment
free
since
early
morning
and
had
not
once
had
time
to
think
of
what
lay
before
her
.
in
the
damp
chill
air
and
crowded
closeness
of
the
swaying
carriage
she
for
the
first
time
vividly
imagined
what
was
in
store
for
her
there
at
the
ball
in
those
brightly
lighted
rooms
with
music
flowers
dances
the
emperor
and
all
the
brilliant
young
people
of
peters
burg
.
the
prospect
was
so
splendid
that
she
hardly
believed
it
would
come
true
so
out
of
keeping
was
it
with
the
chill
darkness
and
closeness
of
the
carriage
.
she
understood
all
that
awaited
her
only
when
after
stepping
over
the
red
baize
at
the
entrance
she
entered
the
hall
took
off
her
fur
cloak
and
beside
s6nya
and
in
front
of
her
mother
mounted
the
brightly
illuminated
stairs
between
the
flowers
.
only
then
did
she
remember
how
she
must
behave
at
a
ball
and
tried
to
assume
the
majestic
air
she
considered
indispensable
for
a
girl
on
such
an
occasion
.
but
fortunately
for
her
she
felt
her
eyes
growing
misty
she
saw
nothing
clearly
her
pulse
beat
a
hundred
to
the
minute
and
the
blood
throbbed
at
her
heart
.
she
could
not
assume
that
pose
which
would
have
made
her
ridiculous
and
she
moved
on
almost
fainting
from
excitement
and
try
ing
with
all
her
might
to
conceal
it
.
and
this
was
the
very
attitude
that
became
her
best
.
be
fore
and
behind
them
other
visitors
were
en
tering
also
talking
in
low
tones
and
wearing
ball
dresses
.
the
mirrors
on
the
landing
re
flected
ladies
in
white
paleblue
and
pink
dresses
with
diamonds
and
pearls
on
their
bare
necks
and
arms
.
natasha
looked
in
the
mirrors
and
could
not
distinguish
her
reflection
from
the
others
.
all
was
blended
into
one
brilliant
procession
.
on
entering
the
ballroom
the
regular
hum
of
voices
footsteps
and
greetings
deafened
na
tdsha
and
the
light
and
glitter
dazzled
her
still
more
.
the
host
and
hostess
who
had
already
been
standing
at
the
door
for
half
an
hour
re
peating
the
same
words
to
the
various
arrivals
charmt
de
vous
voir
l
greeted
the
rost6vs
and
per6nskaya
in
the
same
manner
.
the
two
girls
in
their
white
dresses
each
with
a
rose
in
her
black
hair
both
curtsied
in
the
same
way
but
the
hostess
eye
involuntarily
rested
longer
on
the
slim
natasha
.
she
looked
at
her
and
gave
her
alone
a
special
smile
in
addition
to
her
usual
smile
as
hostess
.
looking
at
her
she
may
have
recalled
the
golden
irre
coverable
days
of
her
own
girlhood
and
her
own
first
ball
.
the
host
also
followed
natdsha
with
his
eyes
and
asked
the
count
which
was
his
daughter
.
charming
said
he
kissing
the
tips
of
his
fingers
.
in
the
ballroom
guests
stood
crowding
at
the
entrance
doors
awaiting
the
emperor
.
the
countess
took
up
a
position
in
one
of
the
front
rows
of
that
crowd
.
natdsha
heard
and
felt
that
several
people
were
asking

he
had

before

in

stood
by

a

looking

pounced
down
on

asking

to

aside

some

with
faces
be
traying
complete
forgetfulness
of
all
the
rules
of

pushed
forward
to
the
detriment

began
to

take

for

everyone
moved

the
emperor
came
smiling
out
of
the
drawing

leading
his
hostess
by
the
hand

not

up

that

crowded

she
was
not

about

or
any
of

whom
per6nskaya
was
pointing

she
had
but
one
thought
is
it
possible
no
one
will
ask
me
that
i
shall
not
be
among
the
first
to
dance
is
it
possible
that
not
one
of
all
these
men
will
notice
me
they
do
not
even
seem
to
see
me
or
if
they
do
they
look
as
if
they
were
saying
ah
shes

its
not

its

she
thought
.
they
must

how
they
would
enjoy

.
the
strains
of
the
polonaise
which
had
con
tinued
for
a
considerable
time
had
begun
to
sound
like
a
sad
reminiscence
in
natashas
ears
.
she
wanted
to
cry

per6nskaya
had
left
them
.
the
count
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
she
and
the
countess
and
s6nya
were
standing
by
themselves
as
in
the
depths
of
a
forest
amid
that
crowd
of
strangers
with
no

interested
in

not

not

the
handsome
anatole
was
smil
ingly
talking
to
a
partner
on
his
arm
and
looked
at
natdsha
as
one
looks
at
a
wall
.

berg
and
his
wife
who
were
not
dancing
came
up
to
them
.
this
family
gathering
seemed
humiliating
to
natdsha
as
if
there
were
nowhere
else
for
the
family
to
talk
but
here
at
the
ball
.
she
did
not
listen
to
or
look
at
vera
who
was
telling
her
something
about
her
own
green
dress
.
at
last
the
emperor
stopped
beside
his
last
partner
he
had
danced
with
three
and
the
music
ceased
.
a
worried
aidedecamp
ran
up
to
the
rostrivs
requesting
them
to
stand
far
ther
back
though
as
it
was
they
were
already
close
to
the
wall
and
from
the
gallery
re
sounded
the
distinct
precise
enticingly
rhyth
mical
strains
of
a
waltz
.
the
emperor
looked
smilingly
down
the
room
.
a
minute
passed
but
no
one
had
yet
begun
dancing
.
an
aidede
camp
the
master
of
ceremonies
went
up
to
countess
bezukhova
and
asked
her
to
dance
.
she
smilingly
raised
her
hand
and
laid
it
on
his
shoulder
without
looking
at
him
.
the
aide
decamp
an
adept
in
his

grasping
his
part
ner
firmly
round
her
waist
with
confident
de
liberation
started
smoothly
gliding
first
round
the
edge
of
the
circle
then
at
the
corner
of
the
room
he
caught
hlnes
left
hand
and
turned
her
the
only
sound
audible
apart
from
the
everquickening
music
being
the
rhythmic
click
of
the
spurs
on
his
rapid
agile
feet
while
at
every
third
beat
his
partners
velvet
dress
spread
out
and
seemed
to
flash
as
she
whirled
round
.
natdsha
gazed
at
them
and
was
ready
to
cry
because
it
was
not
she
who
was
dancing
that
first
turn
of
the
waltz
.
prince
andrew
in
the
white
uniform
of
a
cavalry
colonel
wearing
stockings
and
danc
ing
shoes
stood
looking
animated
and
bright
in
the
front
row
of
the
circle
not
far
from
the
rost6vs
.
baron
firhoff
was
talking
to
him
about
the
first
sitting
of
the
council
of
state
to
be
held
next
day
.
prince
andrew
as
one
close
ly
connected
with
sperdnski
and
participating
in
the
work
of
the
legislative
commission
could
give
reliable
information
about
that
sitting
concerning
which
various
rumors
were
cur
rent
.
but
not
listening
to
what
firhoff
was
say
ing
he
was
gazing
now
at
the
sovereign
and
now
at
the
men
intending
to
dance
who
had
not
yet
gathered
courage
to
enter
the
circle
.
prince
andrew
was
watching
these
men
abashed
by
the
emperors
presence
and
the
women
who
were
breathlessly
longing
to
be
asked
to
dance
.
pierre
came
up
to
him
and
caught
him
by
the
arm
.
you
always
dance
.
i
have
a
protgee
the
young
rost6va
here
.
ask
her
he
said
.
where
is
she
asked
bolk6nski
.
excuse
me
he
added
turning
to
the
baron
we
will
finish
this
conversation
elsewhere
at
a
ball
one
must
dance
.
he
stepped
forward
in
the
direction
pierre
indicated
.
the
despairing
de
jected
expression
of
natdshas
face
caught
his
eye
.
he
recognized
her
guessed
her
feelings
saw
that
it
was
her
dbut
remembered
her
conversation
at
the
window
and
with
an
ex
pression
of
pleasure
on
his
face
approached
countess
rost6va
.
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
my
daughter
said
the
countess
with
heightened
color
.
i
have
the
pleasure
of
being
already
ac
quainted
if
the
countess
remembers
me
said
prince
andrew
with
a
low
and
courteous
bow
quite
belying
per6nskayas
remarks
about
his
rudeness
and
approaching
natdsha
he
held
out
his
arm
to
grasp
her
waist
before
he
had
completed
his
invitation
.
he
asked
her
to
waltz
.
that
tremulous
expression
on
natdshas
face
prepared
either
for
despair
or
rapture
sud
denly
brightened
into
a
happy
grateful
child
like
smile
.
i
have
long
been
waiting
for
you
that
frightened
happy
little
girl
seemed
to
say
by
the
smile
that
replaced
the
threatened
tears
as
she
raised
her
hand
to
prince
andrews
shoul
book
six
der
.
they
were
the
second
couple
to
enter
the
circle
.
prince
andrew
was
one
of
the
best
danc
ers
of
his
day
and
natasha
danced
exquisitely
.
her
little
feetin
their
white
satin
dancing
shoes
did
their
work
swiftly
lightly
and
independ
ently
of
herself
while
her
face
beamed
with
ecstatic
happiness
.
her
slender
bare
arms
and
neck
werenot
beautiful
compared
to
helenes
her
shoulders
looked
thin
and
her
bosom
un
developed
.
but
helene
seemed
as
it
were
hard
ened
by
a
varnish
left
by
the
thousands
of
looks
that
had
scanned
her
person
while
natasha
was
like
a
girl
exposed
for
the
first
time
who
would
have
felt
very
much
ashamed
had
she
not
been
assured
that
this
was
absolutely
necessary
.
prince
andrew
liked
dancing
and
wishing
to
escape
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
political
and
clever
talk
which
everyone
addressed
to
him
wishing
also
to
break
up
the
circle
of
re
straint
he
disliked
caused
by
the
emperors
presence
he
danced
and
had
chosen
natasha
because
pierre
pointed
her
out
to
him
and
be
cause
she
was
the
first
pretty
girl
who
caught
his
eye
but
scarcely
had
he
embraced
that
slen
der
supple
figure
and
felt
her
stirring
so
close
to
him
and
smiling
so
near
him
than
the
wine
of
her
charm
rose
to
his
head
and
he
felt
him
self
revived
and
rejuvenated
when
after
leav
ing
her
he
stood
breathing
deeply
and
watch
ing
the
other
dancers
.
chapter
xvii
after
prince
andrew
boris
came
up
to
ask
natasha
fora
dance
and
then
the
aidedecamp
who
had
opened
the
ball
and
several
other
young
men
so
that
flushed
and
happy
and
passing
on
her
superfluous
partners
to
s6nya
she
did
not
cease
dancing
all
the
evening
.
she
noticed
and
saw
nothing
of
what
occupied
ev
eryone
else
.
not
only
did
she
fail
to
notice
that
the
emperor
talked
a
long
time
with
the
french
ambassador
and
how
particularly
gracious
he
was
to
a
certain
lady
or
that
prince
soandso
and
soandso
did
and
said
this
and
that
and
that
helene
had
great
success
andwashonored
by
the
special
attention
of
soandso
but
she
did
not
even
see
the
emperor
and
only
noticed
that
he
had
gone
because
the
ball
became
live
lier
after
his
departure
.
for
one
of
the
merry
cotillions
before
supper
prince
andrew
was
again
her
partner
.
he
reminded
her
of
their
first
encounter
in
the
otradnoe
avenue
and
how
she
had
been
unable
to
sleep
that
moon
light
night
and
told
her
how
he
had
involun
tarily
overheard
her
.
natasha
blushed
at
that
recollection
and
tried
to
excuse
herself
as
if
there
had
been
something
to
be
ashamed
of
in
what
prince
andrew
had
overheard
.
like
all
men
who
have
grown
up
in
society
prince
andrew
liked
meeting
someone
there
notof
the
conventional
society
stamp
.
andsuch
was
natasha
with
her
surprise
her
delight
her
shyness
and
even
her
mistakes
in
speaking
french
.
with
her
he
behaved
with
special
care
and
tenderness
sitting
beside
her
and
talking
of
the
simplest
and
most
unimportant
matters
he
admired
her
shy
grace
.
in
the
middle
of
the
cotillion
having
completed
one
of
the
figures
natdsha
still
out
of
breath
was
returning
to
her
seat
when
another
dancer
chose
her
.
she
was
tired
and
panting
and
evidently
thought
of
declining
but
immediately
put
her
hand
gaily
on
the
mans
shoulder
smiling
at
prince
andrew
.
id
be
glad
to
sit
beside
you
and
rest
im
tired
but
you
see
how
they
keep
asking
me
and
im
glad
of
it
im
happy
and
i
love
every
body
and
you
and
i
understand
it
all
and
much
much
more
was
said
in
her
smile
.
when
her
partner
left
her
natasha
ran
across
the
room
to
choose
two
ladies
for
the
figure
.
if
she
goes
to
her
cousin
first
and
then
to
another
lady
she
will
be
my
wife
said
prince
andrew
to
himself
quite
to
his
own
surprise
as
he
watched
her
.
she
did
go
first
to
her
cousin
.
whatrubbish
sometimes
enters
ones
head

thought
prince
andrew
but
what
is
certain
is
that
that
girl
is
so
charming
so
original
that
she
wont
be
dancing
here
a
month
before
she
will
be
married
.

.
such
as
she
are
rare
here
he
thought
as
natdsha
readjusting
a
rose
that
was
slipping
on
her
bodice
settled
herself
be
side
him
.
when
the
cotillion
was
over
the
old
count
in
his
blue
coat
came
up
to
the
dancers
.
he
invit
ed
prince
andrew
to
come
and
see
them
and
asked
his
daughter
whether
she
was
enjoying
herself
.
natdsha
did
not
answer
at
once
but
only
looked
up
with
a
smile
that
said
reproach
fully
how
can
you
ask
such
a
question
i
have
never
enjoyed
myself
so
much
be
forel
she
said
and
prince
andrew
noticed
how
her
thin
arms
rose
quickly
as
if
to
embrace
her
father
and
instantly
dropped
again
.
nata
sha
was
happier
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
.
she
was
at
that
height
of
bliss
when
one
becomes
completely
kind
and
good
and
does
not
believe
in
the
possibility
of
evil
unhappi
ness
or
sorrow
.
at
that
ball
pierre
for
the
first
time
felt
humiliated
by
the
position
his
wife
occupied
in
court
circles
.
he
was
gloomy
and
absent
260
war
and
peace
minded
.
a
deep
furrow
ran
across
his
fore
head
and
standing
by
a
window
he
stared
over
his
spectacles
seeing
no
one
.
on
her
way
to
supper
natasha
passed
him
.
pierres
gloomy
unhappy
look
struck
her
.
she
stopped
in
front
of
him
.
she
wished
to
help
him
to
bestow
on
him
the
superabundance
of
her
own
happiness
.
how
delightful
it
is
countsaid
she
.
isnt
it
pierre
smiled
absentmindedly
evidently
not
grasping
what
she
said
.
yes
i
am
very
glad
he
said
.
how
can
people
be
dissatisfied
with
any
thing
thought
natdsha
.
especially
such
a
capital
fellow
as
bezukhov
in
natashas
eyes
all
the
people
at
the
ball
alike
were
good
kind
and
splendid
people
loving
one
another
none
of
them
capable
of
injuring
another
and
so
they
ought
all
to
be
happy
.
chapter
xviii
next
day
prince
andrew
thought
of
the
ball
but
his
mind
did
not
dwell
on
it
long
.
yes
it
was
a
very
brilliant
ball
and
then

.

.

.
yes
that
little
rost6va
is
very
charming
.
theres
something
fresh
original
unpetersburglike
about
her
that
distinguishes
her
.
that
was
all
he
thought
about
yesterdays
ball
and
after
his
morning
tea
he
set
to
work
.
but
either
from
fatigue
or
want
of
sleep
he
was
illdisposed
for
work
and
could
get
noth
ing
done
.
he
kept
criticizing
his
own
work
as
he
often
did
and
was
glad
when
he
heard
some
one
coming
.
the
visitor
was
bftski
who
served
on
var
ious
committees
frequented
all
the
societies
in
petersburg
and
was
a
passionate
devotee
of
the
new
ideas
and
of
sperdnski
and
a
diligent
pe
tersburg
newsmonger
one
of
those
men
who
choose
their
opinions
like
their
clothes
accord
ing
to
the
fashion
but
who
for
that
very
reason
appear
to
be
the
wannest
partisans
.
hardly
had
he
got
rid
of
his
hat
before
he
ran
into
prince
andrews
room
with
a
preoccupied
air
and
at
once
began
talking
.
he
had
just
heard
particulars
of
that
mornings
sitting
of
the
council
of
state
opened
by
the
emperor
and
he
spoke
of
it
enthusiastically
.
the
emperors
speech
had
been
extraordinary
.
it
had
been
a
speech
such
as
only
constitutional
monarchs
deliver
.
the
sovereign
plainly
said
that
the
council
and
senate
are
estates
of
the
realm
he
said
that
the
government
must
rest
not
on
au
thority
but
on
secure
bases
.
the
emperor
said
that
the
fiscal
system
must
be
reorganized
and
the
accounts
published
recounted
bitski
em
phasizing
certain
words
and
opening
his
eyes
significantly
.
ah
yesl
todays
events
mark
an
epoch
the
greatest
epoch
in
our
history
he
concluded
.
prince
andrew
listened
to
the
account
of
the
opening
of
the
council
of
state
which
he
had
so
impatiently
awaited
and
to
which
he
had
attached
such
importance
and
was
sur
prised
that
this
event
now
that
it
had
taken
place
did
not
affect
him
and
even
seemed
quite
insignificant
.
he
listened
with
quiet
irony
to
bitskis
enthusiastic
account
of
it
.
a
very
simple
thought
occurred
to
him
what
does
it
matter
to
me
or
to
bftski
what
the
em
peror
was
pleased
to
say
at
the
council
can
all
that
make
me
any
happier
or
better
and
this
simple
reflection
suddenly
destroyed
all
the
interest
prince
andrew
had
felt
in
the
impending
reforms
.
he
was
going
to
dine
that
evening
at
sperdnskis
with
only
a
few
friends
as
the
host
had
said
when
inviting
him
.
the
prospect
of
that
dinner
in
the
inti
mate
home
circle
of
the
man
he
so
admired
had
greatly
interested
prince
andrew
especially
as
he
had
not
yet
seen
sperdnski
in
his
domestic
surroundings
but
now
he
felt
disinclined
to
go
to
it
.
at
the
appointed
hour
however
he
entered
the
modest
house
sperdnski
owned
in
the
tau
rida
gardens
.
in
the
parqueted
dining
room
of
this
small
house
remarkable
for
its
extreme
cleanliness
suggesting
that
of
a
monastery
prince
andrew
who
was
rather
late
found
the
friendly
gathering
of
sperdnskis
intimate
acquaintances
already
assembled
at
five
oclock
.
there
were
no
ladies
present
except
sperdnskis
little
daughter
longfaced
like
her
father
and
her
governess
.
the
other
guests
were
gervais
magnftski
and
stolypin
.
while
still
in
the
an
teroom
prince
andrew
heard
loud
voices
and
a
ringing
staccato
laugh
a
laugh
such
as
one
hears
on
the
stage
.
someone
it
sounded
like
sperdnski
was
distinctly
ejaculating
hahaha
.
prince
andrew
had
never
before
heard
sperdn
skis
famous
laugh
and
this
ringing
high
pitched
laughter
from
a
statesman
made
a
strange
impression
on
him
.
he
entered
the
din
ing
room
.
the
whole
com
pany
were
standing
between
two
windows
at
a
small
table
laid
with
horsdoeuvres
.
speran
ski
wearing
a
gray
swallowtail
coat
with
a
star
on
the
breast
and
evidently
still
the
same
waist
coat
and
high
white
stock
he
had
worn
at
the
meeting
of
the
council
of
state
stood
at
the
table
with
a
beaming
countenance
.
his
guests
book
six
261
surrounded
him
.
magnitski
addressing
him
self
to
sperdnski
was
relating
an
anecdote
and
sperdnski
was
laughing
in
advance
at
what
magnitski
was
going
to
say
.
when
prince
an
drew
entered
the
room
magnitskis
words
were
again
crowned
by
laughter
.
stolypin
gave
a
deep
bass
guffaw
as
he
munched
a
piece
of
bread
and
cheese
.
gervais
laughed
softly
with
a
hiss
ing
chuckle
and
sperdnski
in
a
highpitched
staccato
manner
.
still
laughing
sperdnski
held
out
his
soft
white
hand
to
prince
andrew
.
very
pleased
to
see
you
prince
he
said
.
onemoment

.

.

.
he
wenton
turning
to
mag
nftski
and
interrupting
his
story
.
we
have
agreed
that
this
is
a
dinner
for
recreation
with
not
a
word
about
business
and
turning
again
to
the
narrator
he
began
to
laugh
afresh
.
prince
andrew
looked
at
the
laughing
spe
rdnski
with
astonishment
regret
and
disillu
sionment
.
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
was
not
sperdnski
but
someone
else
.
everything
that
had
formerly
appeared
mysterious
and
fascinat
ing
in
sperdnski
suddenly
became
plain
and
unattractive
.
at
dinner
the
conversation
did
not
cease
for
a
moment
and
seemed
to
consist
of
the
contents
of
a
book
of
funny
anecdotes
.
before
magnft
ski
had
finished
his
story
someone
else
was
anx
ious
to
relate
something
still
funnier
.
most
of
the
anecdotes
if
not
relating
to
the
state
serv
ice
related
to
people
in
the
service
.
it
seemed
that
in
this
company
the
insignificance
of
those
people
was
so
definitely
accepted
that
the
only
possible
attitude
toward
them
was
one
of
good
humored
ridicule
.
sperdnski
related
how
at
the
council
that
morning
a
deaf
dignitary
when
asked
his
opinion
replied
that
he
thought
so
too
.
gervais
gave
a
long
account
of
an
official
revision
remarkable
for
the
stupidity
of
every
body
concerned
.
stolypin
stuttering
broke
in
to
the
conversation
and
began
excitedly
talk
ing
of
the
abuses
that
existed
under
the
former
order
of
things
threatening
to
give
a
serious
turn
to
the
conversation
.
magnitski
starting
quizzing
stolypin
about
his
vehemence
.
ger
vais
intervened
with
a
joke
and
the
talk
revert
ed
to
its
former
lively
tone
.
evidently
sperdnski
liked
to
rest
after
his
labors
and
find
amusement
in
a
circle
of
friends
and
his
guests
understanding
his
wish
tried
to
enliven
him
and
amuse
themselves
.
but
their
gaiety
seemed
to
prince
andrew
mirthless
and
tiresome
.
sperdn
skis
highpitched
voice
struck
him
unpleasantly
and
the
incessant
laughter
grated
on
him
like
a
false
note
.
prince
andrew
didnot
laugh
and
feared
that
hewould
be
a
damper
on
the
spirits
of
the
company
but
no
one
took
any
notice
of
his
being
out
of
har
mony
with
the
general
mood
.
they
all
seemed
very
gay
.
he
tried
several
times
to
join
in
the
conver
sation
but
his
remarks
were
tossed
aside
each
time
like
a
cork
thrown
out
of
the
water
and
he
could
not
jest
with
them
.
there
was
nothing
wrong
or
unseemly
in
what
they
said
it
was
witty
and
might
have
been
funny
but
it
lacked
just
that
something
which
is
the
salt
of
mirth
and
they
were
not
even
aware
that
such
a
thing
existed
.
after
dinner
sperdnskis
daughter
and
her
governess
rose
.
he
patted
the
little
girl
with
his
white
hand
and
kissed
her
.
and
that
ges
ture
too
seemed
unnatural
to
prince
andrew
.
the
men
remained
at
table
over
their
port
english
fashion
.
in
the
midst
of
a
conversation
that
was
started
about
napoleons
spanish
af
fairs
which
they
all
agreed
in
approving
prince
andrew
began
to
express
a
contrary
opinion
.
sperdnski
smiled
and
with
an
evi
dent
wish
to
prevent
the
conversation
from
taking
an
unpleasant
course
told
a
story
that
had
no
connection
with
the
previous
conver
sation
.
for
a
few
moments
all
were
silent
.
having
sat
some
time
at
table
sperdnski
corked
a
bottle
of
wine
and
remarking
now
adays
good
wine
rides
in
a
carriage
and
pair
passed
it
to
the
servant
and
got
up
.
all
rose
and
continuing
to
talk
loudly
went
into
the
drawing
room
.
two
letters
brought
by
a
courier
were
handed
to
sperdnski
and
he
took
them
to
his
study
.
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
room
the
gen
eral
merriment
stopped
and
the
guests
began
to
converse
sensibly
and
quietly
with
one
an
other
.
now
for
the
recitation
said
sperdnski
on
return
ing
from
his
study
.
a
wonderful
talent
he
said
to
prince
andrew
and
magnftski
im
mediately
assumed
a
pose
and
began
reciting
some
humorous
verses
in
french
which
he
had
composed
about
various
wellknown
peters
burg
people
.
he
was
interrupted
several
times
by
applause
.
when
the
verses
were
finished
prince
andrew
went
up
to
sperdnski
and
took
his
leave
.
where
are
you
off
to
so
early
asked
spe
rdnski
.
i
promised
to
go
to
a
reception
.
they
said
no
more
.
prince
andrew
looked
closely
into
those
mirrorlike
impenetrable
eyes
and
felt
that
it
had
been
ridiculous
of
him
to
have
expected
anything
from
sperdnski
and
26
war
and
peace
from
any
of
his
own
activities
connected
with
him
or
ever
to
have
attributed
importance
to
what
sperdnski
was
doing
.
that
precise
mirth
less
laughter
rang
in
prince
andrews
ears
long
after
he
had
left
the
house
.
when
he
reached
home
prince
andrew
be
gan
thinking
of
his
life
in
petersburg
during
those
last
four
months
as
if
it
were
something
new
.
he
recalled
his
exertions
and
solicitations
and
the
history
of
his
project
of
army
reform
which
had
been
accepted
for
consideration
and
which
they
were
trying
to
pass
over
in
silence
simply
because
another
a
very
poor
one
had
already
been
prepared
and
submitted
to
the
emperor
.
he
thought
of
the
meetings
of
a
com
mittee
of
which
berg
was
a
member
.
he
remem
bered
how
carefully
and
at
what
length
every
thing
relating
to
form
and
procedure
was
dis
cussed
at
those
meetings
and
how
sedulously
and
promptly
all
that
related
to
the
gist
of
the
business
was
evaded
.
he
recalled
his
labors
on
the
legal
code
and
how
painstakingly
he
had
translated
the
articles
of
the
roman
and
french
codes
into
russian
and
he
felt
ashamed
of
him
self
.
then
he
vividly
pictured
to
himself
bo
guchdrovo
his
occupations
in
the
country
his
journey
to
ryazan
he
remembered
the
peas
ants
and
dron
the
village
elder
and
mentally
applying
to
them
the
personal
rights
he
had
divided
into
paragraphs
he
felt
astonished
that
he
could
have
spent
so
much
time
on
such
use
less
work
.
chapter
xix
next
day
prince
andrew
called
at
a
few
houses
he
had
not
visited
before
and
among
them
at
the
rost6vs
with
whom
he
had
renewed
ac
quaintance
at
the
ball
.
apart
from
considera
tions
of
politeness
which
demanded
the
call
he
wanted
to
see
that
original
eager
girl
who
had
left
such
a
pleasant
impression
on
his
mind
in
her
own
home
.
natdsha
was
one
of
the
first
to
meet
him
.
she
was
wearing
a
darkblue
house
dress
in
which
prince
andrew
thought
her
even
prettier
than
in
her
ball
dress
.
she
and
all
the
rost6v
family
welcomed
him
as
an
old
friend
simply
and
cor
dially
.
the
whole
family
whom
he
had
former
ly
judged
severely
now
seemed
to
him
to
con
sist
of
excellent
simple
and
kindly
people
.
the
old
counts
hospitality
and
good
nature
which
struck
one
especially
in
petersburg
as
a
pleas
ant
surprise
were
such
that
prince
andrew
could
not
refuse
to
stay
to
dinner
.
yes
he
thought
they
are
capital
people
whoof
course
have
not
the
slightest
idea
what
a
treasure
they
possess
in
natdsha
but
they
are
kindly
folk
and
form
the
best
possible
setting
for
this
striking
ly
poetic
charming
girl
overflowing
with
life
in
natdsha
prince
andrew
was
conscious
of
a
strange
world
completely
alien
to
him
and
brimful
of
joys
unknown
to
him
a
different
world
that
in
the
otrddnoe
avenue
and
at
the
window
that
moonlight
night
had
already
be
gun
to
disconcert
him
.
now
this
world
discon
certed
him
no
longer
and
was
no
longer
alien
to
him
but
he
himself
having
entered
it
found
in
it
a
new
enjoyment
.
after
dinner
natdsha
at
prince
andrews
re
quest
went
to
the
clavichord
and
began
sing
ing
.
prince
andrew
stood
by
a
window
talking
to
the
ladies
and
listened
to
her
.
in
the
midst
of
a
phrase
he
ceased
speaking
and
suddenly
felt
tears
choking
him
a
thing
he
had
thought
impossible
for
him
.
he
looked
at
natdsha
as
she
sang
and
something
new
and
joyful
stirred
in
his
soul
.
he
felt
happy
and
at
the
same
time
sad
.
he
had
absolutely
nothing
to
weep
about
yet
he
was
ready
to
weep
.
what
about
his
former
love
the
little
princess
his
disillu
sionments

.

.

.
his
hopes
for
the
future

.

.

.
yes
and
no
.
the
chief
reason
was
a
sudden
viv
id
sense
of
the
terrible
contrast
between
some
thing
infinitely
great
and
illimitable
within
him
and
that
limited
and
material
something
that
he
and
even
she
was
.
this
contrast
weighed
on
and
yet
cheered
himwhileshesang
.
as
soon
as
natdsha
had
finished
she
went
up
to
him
and
asked
how
he
liked
her
voice
.
she
asked
this
and
then
became
confused
feeling
that
she
ought
not
to
have
asked
it
.
he
smiled
looking
at
her
and
said
he
liked

prince
andrew
left
the
rost6vs
late
in
the
evening
.
he
went
to
bed
from
habit
but
soon
realized
that
he
could
not
sleep
.
having
lit
his
candle
he
sat
up
in
bed
then
got
up
then
lay
down
again
not
at
all
troubled
by
his
sleepless
ness
his
soul
was
as
fresh
and
joyful
as
if
he
had
stepped
out
of
a
stuffy
room
into
gods
own
fresh
air
.
it
did
not
enter
his
head
that
he
was
in
love
with
natdsha
he
was
not
thinking
about
her
but
only
picturing
her
to
himself
and
in
consequence
all
life
appeared
in
a
new
light
.
why
do
i
strive
why
do
i
toil
in
this
narrow
confined
frame
when
life
all
life
with
all
its
joys
is
open
to
me
said
he
to
himself
.
and
for
the
first
time
for
a
very
long
while
he
began
making
happy
plans
for
the
future
.
he
decided
that
he
must
attend
to
his
sons
educa
tion
by
finding
a
tutor
and
putting
the
boy
in
his
charge
then
he
ought
to
retire
from
theserv

ice
and
go
abroad
and
see
england
switzer
land
and
italy
.
i
must
use
my
freedom
while
i
feel
so
much
strength
and
youth
in
me
he
said
to
himself
.
pierre
was
right
when
he
said
one
must
believe
in
the
possibility
of
happiness
in
order
to
be
happy
and
now
i
do
believe
in
it
.
let
the
dead
bury
their

but
while

one
must
live
and
be

chapter
xx
one
morning
colonel
berg
whom
pierre
knew
as
he
knew
everybody
in
moscow
and
peters
burg
came
to
see
him
.
berg
arrived
in
an
im
maculate
brandnew
uniform
with
his
hair
po
maded
and
brushed
forward
over
his
temples
as
the
emperor
alexander
wore
his
hair
.
i
have
just
been
to
see
the
countess
your
wife
.
unfortunately
she
could
not
grant
my
re
quest
but
i
hope
count
i
shall
be
more
for
tunate
with
you
he
said
with
a
smile
.
what
is
it
you
wish
colonel
i
am
at
your
service
.
i
have
now
quite
settled
in
my
new
rooms
count
berg
said
this
with
perfect
conviction
that
this
information
could
not
but
be
agree
able
and
so
i
wish
to
arrange
just
a
small
par
ty
formy
own
and
my
wifes
friends
.
hesmiled
still
more
pleasantly
.
i
wished
to
ask
the
countess
and
you
to
do
me
the
honor
of
coming
to
tea
and
to
supper
.
only
countess
hlne
considering
the
soci
ety
of
such
people
as
the
bergs
beneath
her
could
be
cruel
enough
to
refuse
such
an
invita
tion
.
berg
explained
so
clearly
why
he
wanted
to
collect
at
his
house
a
small
but
select
com
pany
and
why
this
would
give
him
pleasure
and
why
though
he
grudged
spending
money
on
cards
or
anything
harmful
he
was
prepared
to
run
into
some
expense
for
the
sake
of
good
societythat
pierre
could
not
refuse
and
promised
to
come
.
but
dont
be
late
count
if
i
may
venture
to
ask
about
ten
minutes
to
eight
please
.
we
shall
make
up
a
rubber
.
our
general
is
coming
.
he
is
very
good
to
me
.
we
shall
have
supper
count
.
so
you
will
do
me
the
favor
.
contrary
to
his
habit
of
being
late
pierre
on
that
day
arrived
at
the
bergs
house
not
at
ten
but
at
fifteen
minutes
to
eight
.
having
prepared
everything
necessary
for
the
party
the
bergs
were
ready
for
their
guests
arrival
.
in
their
new
clean
and
light
study
with
its
small
busts
and
pictures
and
new
furniture
sat
berg
and
his
wife
.
berg
closely
buttoned
up
in
his
new
uniform
sat
beside
his
wife
explain
ing
to
her
that
one
always
could
and
should
be
acquainted
with
people
above
one
because
on
ly
then
does
one
get
satisfaction
from
acquaint
ances
.
you
can
get
to
know
something
you
can
ask
for
something
.
see
how
i
managed
from
my
first
promotion
.
berg
measured
his
life
not
by
years
but
by
promotions
.
my
comrades
are
still
nobodies
while
i
am
only
waiting
for
a
vacancy
to
command
a
regiment
and
have
the
happiness
to
be
your
husband
.
he
rose
and
kissed
vcras
hand
and
on
the
way
to
her
straightened
out
a
turnedup
corner
of
the
car
pet
.
and
how
have
i
obtained
all
this
chief
ly
by
knowing
how
to
choose
my
acquaintances
.
it
goes
without
saying
that
one
must
be
consci
entious
and
methodical
.
berg
smiled
with
a
sense
of
his
superiority
over
a
weak
woman
and
paused
reflecting
that
this
dear
wife
of
his
was
after
all
but
a
weak
woman
who
could
not
understand
all
that
con
stitutes
a
mans
dignity
what
it
was
ein
mann
zu
sein
.
wra
at
the
same
time
was
smiling
with
a
sense
of
superiority
over
her
good
conscien
tious
husband
who
all
the
same
understood
life
wrongly
as
according
to
vera
all
men
did
.
berg
judging
by
his
wife
thought
all
women
weak
and
foolish
.
vera
judging
only
by
her
husband
and
generalizing
from
that
observa
tion
supposed
that
all
men
though
they
un
derstand
nothing
and
are
conceited
and
sel
fish
ascribe
common
sense
to
themselves
alone
.
berg
rose
and
embraced
his
wife
carefully
so
as
not
to
crush
her
lace
fichu
for
which
he
had
paid
a
good
price
kissing
her
straight
on
the
lips
.
the
only
thing
is
we
mustnt
have
chil
dren
too
soon
he
continued
following
an
un
conscious
sequence
of
ideas
.
yes
answered
vera
i
dont
at
all
want
that
.
we
must
live
for
society
.
princess
yusiipova
wore
one
exactly
like
this
said
berg
pointing
to
the
fichu
with
a
happy
and
kindly
smile
.
just
then
count
beziikhov
was
announced
.
husband
and
wife
glanced
at
one
another
both
smiling
with
selfsatisfaction
and
each
mentally
claiming
the
honor
of
this
visit
.
this
is
what
comes
of
knowing
how
to
make
acquaintances
thought
berg
.
this
is
what
comes
of
knowing
how
to
conduct
oneself
.
but
please
dont
interrupt
me
when
i
am
entertaining
the
guests
said
vera
because
i
know
what
interests
each
of
them
and
what
to

say
to
different
people
.
berg
smiled
again
.
it
cant
be
helped
men
must
sometimes
have
masculine
con
versa
tion
said
he
.
they
received
pierre
in
their
small
new
drawingroom
where
it
was
impossible
to
sit
down
anywhere
without
disturbing
its
sym
metry
neatness
and
order
so
it
was
quite
comprehensible
and
not
strange
that
berg
hav
ing
generously
offered
to
disturb
the
symmetry
of
an
armchair
or
of
the
sofa
for
his
dear
guest
but
being
apparently
painfully
undecided
on
the
matter
himself
eventually
left
the
visitor
to
settle
the
question
of
selection
.
pierre
dis
turbed
the
symmetry
by
moving
a
chair
for
him
self
and
berg
and
vra
immediately
began
their
evening
party
interrupting
each
other
in
their
efforts
to
entertain
their
guest
.
vera
having
decided
in
her
own
mind
that
pierre
ought
to
be
entertained
with
conversa
tion
about
the
french
embassy
at
once
began
accordingly
.
berg
having
decided
that
mascu
line
conversation
was
required
interrupted
his
wifes
remarks
and
touched
on
the
question
of
the
war
with
austria
and
unconsciously
jumped
from
the
general
subject
to
personal
considerations
as
to
the
proposals
made
him
to
take
part
in
the
austrian
campaign
and
the
reasons
why
he
had
declined
them
.
though
the
conversation
was
very
incoherent
and
vera
was
angry
at
the
intrusion
of
the
masculine
el
ement
both
husband
and
wife
felt
with
satis
faction
that
even
if
only
one
guest
was
pres
ent
their
evening
had
begun
very
well
and
was
as
like
as
two
peas
to
every
other
evening
party
with
its
talk
tea
and
lighted
candles
.
before
long
boris
bergs
old
comrade
ar
rived
.
there
was
a
shade
of
condescension
and
patronage
in
his
treatment
of
berg
and
vera
.
after
boris
came
a
lady
with
the
colonel
then
the
general
himself
then
the
rost6vs
and
the
party
became
unquestionably
exactly
like
all
other
evening
parties
.
berg
and
vera
could
not
repress
their
smiles
of
satisfaction
at
the
sight
of
all
this
movement
in
their
drawing
room
at
the
sound
of
the
disconnected
talk
the
rustling
of
dresses
and
the
bowing
and
scraping
.
every
thing
was
just
as
everybody
always
has
it
es
pecially
so
the
general
who
admired
the
apart
ment
patted
berg
on
the
shoulder
and
with
parental
authority
superintended
the
setting
out
of
the
table
for
boston
.
the
general
sat
down
by
count
ilya
rost6v
who
was
next
to
himself
the
most
important
guest
.
the
old
peo
ple
sat
with
the
old
the
young
with
the
young
and
the
hostess
at
the
tea
table
on
which
stood
war
and
peace
exactly
the
same
kind
of
cakes
in
a
silver
cake
basket
as
the
panins
had
at
their
party
.
every
thing
was
just
as
it
was
everywhere
else
.
chapter
xxi
pierre
as
one
of
the
principal
guests
had
to
sit
down
to
boston
with
count
rost6v
the
general
and
the
colonel
.
at
the
card
table
he
happened
to
be
directly
facing
natdsha
and
was
struck
by
a
curious
change
that
had
come
over
her
since
the
ball
.
she
was
silent
and
not
only
less
pretty
than
at
the
ball
but
only
re
deemed
from
plainness
by
her
look
of
gentle
indifference
to
everything
around
.
whats
the
matter
with
her
thought
pierre
glancing
at
her
.
she
was
sitting
by
her
sister
at
the
tea
table
and
reluctantly
without
looking
at
him
made
some
reply
to
boris
who
sat
down
beside
her
.
after
playing
out
a
whole
suit
and
to
his
partners
delight
taking
five
tricks
pierre
hearing
greetings
and
the
steps
of
someone
who
had
entered
the
room
while
he
was
picking
up
his
tricks
glanced
again
at
natasha
.
what
has
happened
to
her
he
asked
him
self
with
still
greater
surprise
.
prince
andrew
was
standing
before
her
saying
something
to
her
with
a
look
of
tender
solicitude
.
she
having
raised
her
head
wis
looking
up
at
him
flushed
and
evidently
try
ing
to
master
her
rapid
breathing
.
and
the
bright
glow
of
some
inner
fire
that
had
been
suppressed
was
again
alight
in
her
.
she
was
completely
transformed
and
from
a
plain
girl
had
again
become
what
she
had
been
at
the
ball
.
prince
andrew
went
up
to
pierre
and
the
latter
noticed
a
new
and
youthful
expression
in
his
friends
face
.
pierre
changed
places
several
times
during
the
game
sitting
now
with
his
back
to
natdsha
and
now
facing
her
but
during
the
whole
of
the
six
rubbers
he
watched
her
and
his
friend
.
something
very
important
is
happening
be
tween
them
thought
pierre
and
a
feeling
that
was
both
joyful
and
painful
agitated
him
and
made
him
neglect
the
game
.
after
six
rubbers
the
general
got
up
saying
that
it
was
no
use
playing
like
that
and
pierre
was
released
.
natdsha
on
one
side
was
talking
with
s6nya
and
boris
and
vera
with
a
subtle
smile
was
saying
something
to
prince
andrew
.
pierre
went
up
to
his
friend
and
asking
wheth
er
they
were
talking
secrets
sat
down
beside
them
.
vra
having
noticed
prince
andrews
attentions
to
natdsha
decided
that
at
a
party
book
six
265
a
real
evening
party
subtle
allusions
to
the
tender
passion
were
absolutely
necessary
and
seizing
a
moment
when
prince
andrew
was
alone
began
a
conversation
with
him
about
feelings
in
general
and
about
her
sister
.
with
so
intellectual
a
guest
as
she
considered
prince
andrew
to
be
she
felt
that
she
had
to
employ
her
diplomatic
tact
.
when
pierre
went
up
to
them
he
noticed
that
vera
was
being
carried
away
by
her
self
satisfied
talk
but
that
prince
andrew
seemed
embarrassed
a
thing
that
rarely
happened
with
him
.
what
do
you
think
wra
was
saying
with
an
arch
smile
.
you
are
so
discerning
prince
and
understand
peoples
characters
so
well
at
a
glance
.
what
do
you
think
of
natalie
could
she
be
constant
in
her
attachments
could
she
like
other
women
vra
meant
herself
love
a
man
once
for
all
and
remain
true
to
him
for
ever
that
is
what
i
consider
true
love
.
what
do
you
think
prince
i
know
your
sister
too
little
replied
prince
andrew
with
a
sarcastic
smile
under
which
he
wished
to
hide
his
embarrassment
to
be
able
to
solve
so
delicate
a
question
and
then
i
have
noticed
that
the
less
attractive
a
woman
is
the
more
constant
she
is
likely
to
be
he
added
and
looked
up
at
pierre
who
was
just
approach
ing
them
.
yes
that
is
true
prince
.
in
our
days
con
tinued
wra
mentioning
our
days
as
peo
ple
of
limited
intelligence
are
fond
of
doing
imagining
that
they
have
discovered
and
ap
praised
the
peculiar
ties
of
our
days
and
that
human
characteristics
change
with
the
times
in
our
days
a
girl
has
so
much
freedom
that
the
pleasure
of
being
courted
often
stifles
real
feeling
in
her
.
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
natalie
is
very
susceptible
.
this
return
to
the
subject
of
natalie
caused
prince
andrew
to
knit
his
brows
with
discomfort
he
was
about
to
rise
but
wra
continued
with
a
still
more
subtle
smile
i
think
no
one
has
been
more
courted
than
she
she
went
on
but
till
quite
lately
she
nev
er
cared
seriously
for
anyone
.
now
you
know
count
she
said
to
pierre
even
our
dear
cous
in
boris
who
between
ourselves
was
very
far
gone
in
the
land
of
tenderness

.

.

.
alluding
to
a
map
of
love
much
in
vogue
at
that
time
.
prince
andrew
frowned
and
remained
si
lent
.
you
are
friendly
with
bods
arent
you
asked
v6ra
.
yes
i
know
him
.

..
.
i
expect
he
has
told
you
of
his
childish
love
for
natasha
oh
there
was
childish
love
suddenly
asked
prince
andrew
blushing
unexpectedly
.
yes
you
know
between
cousins
intimacy
often
leads
to
love
.
le

dont
you
think
so
oh

undoubtedly
i

said
prince
andrew
and
with
sudden
and
unnatural
liveliness
he
began
chaffing
pierre
about
the
need
to
be
very
care
ful
with
his
fiftyyearold
moscow
cousins
and
in
the
midst
of
these
jesting
remarks
he
rose
taking
pierre
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
aside
.
well
asked
pierre
seeing
his
friends
strange
animation
with
surprise
and
noticing
the
glance
he
turned
on
natisha
as
he
rose
.
i
must

..
.
i
must
have
a
talk
with
you
said
prince
andrew
.
you
know
that
pair
of
womens
gloves
he
referred
to
the
ftf
asonic
gloves
given
to
a
newly
initiated
brother
to
present
to
the
woman
he
loved
.
i

..
.
but
no
i
will
talk
to
you
later
on
and
with
a
strange
light
in
his
eyes
and
restlessness
in
his
move
ments
prince
andrew
approached
natdsha
and
sat
down
beside
her
.
pierre
saw
how
prince
andrew
asked
her
something
and
how
she
flushed
as
she
replied
.
but
at
that
moment
berg
came
to
pierre
and
began
insisting
that
he
should
take
part
in
an
argument
between
the
general
and
the
colonel
on
the
affairs
in
spain
.
berg
was
satisfied
and
happy
.
the
smile
of
pleasure
never
left
his
face
.
the
party
was
very
successful
and
quite
like
other
parties
he
had
seen
.
everything
was
similar
the
ladies
subtle
talk
the
cards
the
general
raising
his
voice
at
the
card
table
and
the
samovar
arid
the
tea
cakes
only
one
thing
was
lacking
that
he
had
al
ways
seen
at
the
evening
parties
he
wished
to
imitate
.
they
had
not
yet
had
a
loud
conversa
tion
among
the
men
and
a
dispute
about
some
thing
important
and
clever
.
now
the
general
had
begun
such
a
discussion
and
so
berg
drew
pierre
to
it
.
chapter

next
day
having
been
invited
by
the
count
prince
andrew
dined
with
the
rost6vs
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
there
.
everyone
in
the
house
realized
for
whose
sake
prince
andrew
came
and
without
con
cealing
it
he
tried
to
be
with
natdsha
all
day
.
not
only
in
the
soul
of
the
frightened
yet
hap
py
and
enraptured
natisha
but
in
the
whole
house
there
was
a
feeling
of
awe
at
something

war
and
peace
important
that
was
bound
to
happen
.
the
countess
looked
with
sad
and
sternly
serious
eyes
at
prince
andrew
when
he
talked
to
na
tdsha
and
timidly
started
some
artificial
con
versation
about
trifles
as
soon
as
he
looked
her
way
.
s6nya
was
afraid
to
leave
natasha
and
afraid
of
being
in
the
way
when
she
was
with
them
natasha
grew
pale
in
a
panic
of
expec
tation
when
she
remained
alone
with
him
for
a
moment
.
prince
andrew
surprised
her
by
his
timidity
.
she
felt
that
he
wanted
to
say
some
thing
to
her
but
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
so
.
in
the
evening
when
prince
andrew
had
left
the
countess
went
up
to
natdsha
and
whispered
well
what
mamma
for
heavens
sake
dont
ask
me
anything
now
one
cant
talk
about
that
said
natdsha
.
but
all
the
same
that
night
natdsha
now
agitated
and
now
frightened
lay
a
long
time
in
her
mothers
bed
gazing
straight
before
her
.
she
told
her
how
he
had
complimented
her
how
he
told
her
he
was
going
abroad
asked
her
where
they
were
going
to
spend
the
summer
and
then
how
he
had
asked
her
about
boris
.
but
such
a

..
.
such
a

..
.
never
happened
to
me
before
she
said
.
only
i
feel
afraid
in
his
presence
.
i
am
always
afraid
when
im
with
him
.
what
does
that
mean
does
it
mean
that
its
the
real

now

what
silliness
to
sleep
mummy
mummy
such
a
thing
never
happened
to
me
before
she
said
surprised
and
alarmed
at
the
feeling
she
was
aware
of
in
herself
.
and
could
we
ever
have
thought

.

.

.
it
seemed
to
natdsha
that
even
at
the
time
she
first
saw
prince
andrew
at
otradnoe
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
.
it
was
as
if
she
feared
this
strange
unexpected
happiness
of
meeting
again
the
very
man
she
had
then
cho
sen
she
was
firmly
convinced
she
had
done
so
and
of
finding
him
as
it
seemed
not
indiffer
ent
to
her
.
and
it
had
to
happen
that
he
should
come
specially
to
petersburg
while
we
are
here
.
and
it
had
to
happen
that
we
should
meet
at
that
ball
.
it
is
fate
.
clearly
it
is
fate
that
everything
led
up
to
this
already
then
directly
i
saw
him
i
felt
something
peculiar
.
what
else
did
he
say
to
you
what
are
those
verses
read
them

.

.

.
said
her
mother
thoughtfully
referring
to
some
verses
prince
andrew
had
written
in
natdshas
album
.
mamma
one
need
not
be
ashamed
of
his
being
a
widower

to
god
.
marriages
are
made
in
heaven

said
her
mother
.
darling
mummy
how
i
love
you
how
hap
py
i
am
cried
natdsha
shedding
tears
of
joy
and
excitement
and
embracing
her
mother
.
at
that
very
time
prince
andrew
was
sitting
with
pierre
and
telling
him
of
his
love
for
na
tdsha
and
his
firm
resolve
to
make
her
his
wife
.
that
day
countess
hlene
had
a
reception
at
her
house
.
the
french
ambassador
was
there
and
a
foreign
prince
of
the
blood
who
had
of
late
become
a
frequent
visitor
of
hers
and
many
brilliant
ladies
and
gentlemen
.
pierre
who
had
come
downstairs
walked
through
the
rooms
and
struck
everyone
by
his
preoccupied
absentminded
and
morose
air
.
since
the
ball
he
had
felt
the
approach
of
a
fit
of
nervous
depression
and
had
made
desper
ate
efforts
to
combat
it
.
since
the
intimacy
of
his
wife
with
the
royal
prince
pierre
had
un
expectedly
been
made
a
gentleman
of
the
bed
chamber
and
from
that
time
he
had
begun
to
feel
oppressed
and
ashamed
in
court
society
and
dark
thoughts
of
the
vanity
of
all
things
human
came
to
him
oftener
than
before
.
at
the
same
time
the
feeling
he
had
noticed
be
tween
his
protgee
natasha
and
prince
an
drew
accentuated
his
gloom
by
the
contrast
be
tween
his
own
position
and
his
friends
.
he
tried
equally
to
avoid
thinking
about
his
wife
and
about
natasha
and
prince
andrew
and
again
everything
seemed
to
him
insignificant
in
comparison
with
eternity
again
the
ques
tion
for
what
presented
itself
and
he
forced
himself
to
work
day
and
night
at
masonic
la
bors
hoping
to
drive
away
the
evil
spirit
that
threatened
him
.
toward
midnight
after
he
had
left
the
countess
apartments
he
was
sit
ting
upstairs
in
a
shabby
dressing
gown
copy
ing
out
the
original
transactions
of
the
scottish
lodge
of
freemasons
at
a
table
in
his
low
room
cloudy
with
tobacco
smoke
when
someone
came
in
.
it
was
prince
andrew
.
ah
its
you
said
pierre
with
a
preoccu
pied
dissatisfied
air
.
and
i
you
see
am
hard
at
it
.
he
pointed
to
his
manuscript
book
with
that
air
of
escaping
from
the
ills
of
life
with
which
unhappy
people
look
at
their
work
.
prince
andrew
with
a
beaming
ecstatic
ex
pression
of
renewed
life
on
his
face
paused
in
front
of
pierre
and
not
noticing
his
sad
look
smiled
at
him
with
the
egotism
of
joy
.
well
dear
heart
said
he
i
wanted
to
tell
book
you
about
it
yesterday
and
i
have
come
to
do
so
today
.
i
never
experienced
anything
like
it
before
.
i
am
in
love
my
friend
suddenly
pierre
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
dumped
his
heavy
person
down
on
the
sofa
be
side
prince
andrew
.
with
natdsha
rost6va
yes
said
he
.
yes
yes
who
else
should
it
be
i
should
never
have
believed
it
but
the
feel
ing
is
strong
er
than
i
.
yesterday
i
tormented
myself
and
suffered
but
i
would
not
exchange
even
that
torment
for
anything
in
the
world
i
have
not
lived
till
now
.
at
last
i
live
but
i
cant
live
without
her
but
can
she
love
me

..
.
i
am
too
old
for
her
.

.

.

.
why
dont
you
speak
i
i
what
did
i
tell
you
said
pierre
sud
denly
rising
and
beginning
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
.
i
always
thought
it
.

..
.
that
girl
is
such
a
treasure

.

.

.
she
is
a
rare
girl
.

.

.

.
my
dear
friend
i
entreat
you
dont
philoso
phize
dont
doubt
marry
marry
marry
.

.

.

.
and
i
am
sure
there
will
not
be
a
happier
man
than
you
.
but
what
of
her
she
loves
you
.
dont
talk
rubbish

.

.

.
said
prince
an
drew
smiling
and
looking
into
pierres
eyes
.
she
does
i
know
pierre
cried
fiercely
.
but
do
listen
returned
prince
andrew
holding
him
by
the
arm
.
do
you
know
the
condition
i
am
in
i
must
talk
about
it
to
some
one
.
well
go
on
go
on
.
i
am
very
glad
said
pierre
and
his
face
really
changed
his
brow
be
came
smooth
and
he
listened
gladly
to
prince
andrew
.
prince
andrew
seemed
and
really
was
quite
a
different
quite
a
new
man
.
where
was
his
spleen
his
contempt
for
life
his
disillusion
ment
pierre
was
the
only
person
to
whom
he
made
up
his
mind
to
speak
openly
and
to
him
he
told
all
that
was
in
his
soul
.
now
he
boldly
and
lightly
made
plans
for
an
extended
future
said
he
could
not
sacrifice
his
own
happiness
to
his
fathers
caprice
and
spoke
of
how
he
would
either
make
his
father
consent
to
this
marriage
and
love
her
or
would
do
without
his
consent
then
he
marveled
at
the
feeling
that
had
mas
tered
him
as
at
something
strange
apart
from
and
independent
of
himself
.
1
should
not
have
believed
anyone
who
told
me
that
i
was
capable
of
such
love
said
prince
andrew
.
it
is
not
at
all
the
same
feel
ing
that
i
knew
in
the
past
.
the
whole
world
is
now
for
me
divided
into
two
halves
one
half
is
she
and
there
all
is
joy
hope
light
the
oth
er
half
is
everything
where
she
is
not
and
there
six

all
is
gloom
and
darkness
.

.

.

.
darkness
and
gloom
reiterated
pierre
yes
yes
i
understand
that
.
i
cannot
help
loving
the
light
it
is
not
my
fault
.
and
i
am
very
happy
you
understand
me
i
know
you
are
glad
for
my
sake
.
yes
yes
pierre
assented
looking
at
his
friend
with
a
touched
and
sad
expression
in
his
eyes
.
the
brighter
prince
andrews
lot
ap
peared
to
him
the
gloomier
seemed
his
own
.
chapter
xxiii
prince
andrew
needed
his
fathers
consent
to
his
marriage
and
to
obtain
this
he
started
for
the
country
next
day
.
his
father
received
his
sons
communication
with
external
composure
but
inward
wrath
.
he
could
not
comprehend
how
anyone
could
wish
to
alter
his
life
or
introduce
anythingnew
into
it
when
his
own
life
was
already
ending
.
if
only
they
would
let
me
end
my
days
as
i
want
to
thought
the
old
man
then
they
might
do
as
they
please
.
with
his
son
how
ever
he
employed
the
diplomacy
he
reserved
for
important
occasions
and
adopting
a
quiet
tone
discussed
the
whole
matter
.
in
the
first
place
the
marriage
was
not
a
bril
liant
one
as
regards
birth
wealth
or
rank
.
secondly
prince
andrew
was
no
longer
as
young
as
he
had
been
and
his
health
was
poor
the
old
man
laid
special
stress
on
this
while
she
was
very
young
.
thirdly
he
had
a
son
whom
it
would
be
a
pity
to
entrust
to
a
chit
of
a
girl
.
fourthly
and
finally
the
father
said
looking
ironically
at
his
son
i
beg
you
to
put
it
off
for
a
year
go
abroad
take
a
cure
look
out
as
you
wanted
to
for
a
german
tutor
for
prince
nicholas
.
then
if
your
love
or
passion
or
obstinacy
as
you
please
is
still
as
great
marry
and
thats
my
last
word
on
it
.
mind
the
last

.

.

.
concluded
the
prince
in
a
tone
which
showed
that
nothing
would
make
him
alter
his
decision
.
prince
andrew
saw
clearly
that
the
old
man
hoped
that
his
feelings
or
his
fiancevs
would
not
stand
a
years
test
or
that
he
the
old
prince
himself
would
die
before
then
and
he
de
cided
to
conform
to
his
fathers
wishto
pro
pose
and
postpone
the
wedding
for
a
year
.
three
weeks
after
the
last
evening
he
had
spent
with
the
rost6vs
prince
andrew
re
turned
to
petersburg
.
next
day
after
her
talk
with
her
mother
na
tdsha
expected
bolk6nski
all
day
but
he
did
not
come
.
on
the
second
and
third
day
it
was
268
war
and
peace
the
same
.
pierre
did
not
come
either
and
na
tdsha
not
knowing
that
prince
andrew
had
gone
to
see
his
father
could
not
explain
his
ab
sence
to
herself
.
three
weeks
passed
in
this
way
.
natdsha
had
no
desire
to
go
out
any
where
and
wandered
from
room
to
room
like
a
shadow
idle
and
list
less
she
wept
secretly
at
night
and
did
not
go
to
her
mother
in
the
evenings
.
she
blushed
continually
and
was
irritable
.
it
seemed
to
her
that
everybody
knew
about
her
disappoint
ment
and
was
laughing
at
her
and
pitying
her
.
strong
as
was
her
inward
grief
this
wound
to
her
vanity
intensified
her
misery
.
once
she
came
to
her
mother
tried
to
say
something
and
suddenly
began
to
cry
.
her
tears
were
those
of
an
offended
child
who
does
not
know
why
it
is
being
punished
.
the
countess
began
to
soothe
natdsha
who
after
first
listening
to
her
mothers
words
sud
denly
interrupted
her
leave
off
mamma
i
dont
think
and
dont
want
to
think
about
ill
he
just
came
and
then
left
off
left
off
.

..
.
her
voice
trembled
and
she
again
nearly
cried
but
recovered
and
went
on
quietly
and
i
dont
at
all
want
to
get
married
.
and
i
am
afraid
of
him
i
have
now
become
quite
calm
quite
calm
.
the
day
after
this
conversation
natdsha
put
on
the
old
dress
which
she
knew
had
the
pecul
iar
property
of
conducing
to
cheerfulness
in
the
mornings
and
that
day
she
returned
to
the
old
way
of
life
which
she
had
abandoned
since
the
ball
.
having
finished
her
morning
tea
she
went
to
the
ballroom
which
she
particularly
liked
for
its
loud
resonance
and
began
singing
her
solfeggio
.
when
she
had
finished
her
first
exercise
she
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
sang
a
musical
phrase
that
particu
larly
pleased
her
.
she
listened
joyfully
as
though
she
had
not
expected
it
to
the
charm
of
the
notes
reverberating
filling
the
whole
empty
ballroom
and
slowly
dying
away
and
all
at
once
she
felt
cheerful
.
whats
the
good
of
making
so
much
of
it
things
are
nice
as
it
is
she
said
to
herself
and
she
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
not
stepping
simply
on
the
resounding
parquet
but
treading
with
each
step
from
the
heel
to
the
toe
she
had
on
a
new
and
favorite
pair
of
shoes
and
listening
to
the
regular
tap
of
the
heel
and
creak
of
the
toe
as
gladly
as
she
had
to
the
sounds
of
her
own
voice
.
passing
a
mirror
she
glanced
into
it
.
there
thats
mel
the
expression
of
her
face
seemed
to
say
as
she
caught
sight
of
her
self
.
well
and
very
nice
too
i
need
nobody
.
a
footman
wanted
to
come
in
to
clear
away
something
in
the
room
but
she
would
not
let
him
and
having
closed
the
door
behind
him
continued
her
walk
.
that
morning
she
had
re
turned
to
her
favorite
moodlove
of
and
de
light
in
herself
.
how
charming
that
natdsha
isl
she
said
again
speaking
as
some
third
col
lective
male
person
.
pretty
a
good
voice
young
and
in
nobodys
way
if
only
they
leave
her
in
peace
.
but
however
much
they
left
her
in
peace
she
could
not
now
be
at
peace
and
im
mediately
felt
this
.
in
the
hall
the
porch
door
opened
and
some
one
asked
at
home
and
then
footsteps
were
heard
.
natdsha
was
looking
at
the
mirror
but
did
not
see
herself
.
she
listened
to
the
sounds
in
the
hall
.
when
she
saw
herself
her
face
was
pale
.
it
was
he
.
she
knew
this
for
certain
though
she
hardly
heard
his
voice
through
the
closed
doors
.
pale
and
agitated
natasha
ran
into
the
draw
ing
room
.
mamma
bolk6nski
has
come
she
said
.
mamma
it
is
awful
it
is
unbearable
i
dont
want

..
.
to
be
tormented
what
am
i
to
do

.

.

.
before
the
countess
could
answer
prince
andrew
entered
the
room
with
an
agitated
and
serious
face
.
as
soon
as
he
saw
natdsha
his
face
brightened
.
he
kissed
the
countess
hand
and
natashas
and
sat
down
beside
the
sofa
.
it
is
long
since
we
had
the
pleasure

.

.

.
be
gan
the
countess
but
prince
andrew
inter
rupted
her
by
answering
her
intended
ques
tion
obviously
in
haste
to
say
what
he
had
to
.
i
have
not
been
to
see
you
all
this
time
be
cause
i
have
been
at
my
fathers
.
i
had
to
talk
over
a
very
important
matter
with
him
.
i
only
got
back
last
night
he
said
glancing
at
na
tdsha
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
count
ess
he
added
after
a
moments
pause
.
the
countess
lowered
her
eyes
sighing
deeply
.
i
am
at
your
disposal
she
murmured
.
natdsha
knew
that
she
ought
to
go
away
but
was
unable
to
do
so
something
gripped
her
throat
and
regardlessof
manners
she
stared
straight
at
prince
andrew
with
wideopen
eyes
.
at
once
this
instant

.

.

.
no
it
cant
be
she
thought
.
again
he
glanced
at
her
and
that
glance
con
vinced
her
that
she
was
not
mistaken
.
yes
at
once
that
very
instant
her
fate
would
be
de
cided
.
go
natasha
i
will
call
you
said
the
book
six
269
countess
in
a
whisper
.
natasha
glanced
with
frightened
imploring
eyes
at
prince
andrew
and
at
her
mother
and
went
out
.
i
have
come
countess
to
ask
for
your
daughters
hand
said
prince
andrew
.
the
countess
face
flushed
hotly
but
she
said
nothing
.
your
offer

.

.

.
she
began
at
last
sedately
.
he
remained
silent
looking
into
her
eyes
.
your
offer

.

.

.
she
grew
confused
is
agree
able
to
us
and

..
.
i
accept
your
offer
.
i
am
glad
.
and
my
husband

..
.
i
hope

.

.

.
but
it
will
depend
on
her
.

.

.

.
i
will
speak
to
her
when
i
have
your
con
sent
do
you
give
it
to
me
said
prince
an
drew
.
yes
replied
the
countess
.
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
with
a
mixed
feeling
of
es
trangement
and
tenderness
pressed
her
lips
to
his
forehead
as
he
stooped
to
kiss
her
hand
.
she
wished
to
love
him
as
a
son
but
felt
that
to
her
he
was
a
stranger
and
a
terrifying
man
.
i
am
sure
my
husband
will
consent
said
the
countess
but
your
father

.

.

.
my
father
to
whom
i
have
told
my
plans
has
made
it
an
express
condition
of
his
consent
that
the
wedding
is
not
to
take
place
for
a
year
.
and
i
wished
to
tell
you
of
that
said
prince
andrew
.
it
is
true
that
natasha
is
still
young
but
so
long
as
that

.

.

.
it
is
unavoidable
said
prince
andrew
with
a
sigh
.
i
will
send
her
to
you
said
the
countess
and
left
the
room
.
lord
have
mercy
upon
usl
she
repeated
while
seeking
her
daughter
.
s6nya
said
that
natasha
was
in
her
bedroom
.
natasha
was
sitting
on
the
bed
pale
and
dry
eyed
and
was
gazing
at
the
icons
and
whisper
ing
something
as
she
rapidly
crossed
herself
.
seeing
her
mother
she
jumped
up
and
flew
to
her
.
well
mamma

.

.

.
well

.

.

.
go
go
to
him
.
he
is
asking
for
your
hand
said
the
countess
coldly
it
seemed
to
natasha
.
go

.

.

.
go
said
the
mother
sadly
and
re
proachfully
with
a
deep
sigh
as
her
daughter
ran
away
.
natasha
never
remembered
how
she
entered
the
drawing
room
.
when
she
came
in
and
saw
him
she
paused
.
is
it
possible
that
this
stranger
has
now
become
everything
to
me
she
asked
herself
and
immediately
answered
yes
every
thingl
he
alone
is
now
dearer
to
me
than
every
thing
in
the
world
.
prince
andrew
came
up
to
her
with
downcast
eyes
.
i
have
loved
you
from
the
very
first
mo
ment
i
saw
you
.
may
i
hope
he
looked
at
her
and
was
struck
by
the
seri
ous
impassioned
expression
of
her
face
.
her
face
said
why
ask
why
doubt
what
you
can
not
but
know
why
speak
when
words
cannot
express
what
one
feels
she
drew
near
to
him
and
stopped
.
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
.
do
you
love
me
yes
yes
natasha
murmured
as
if
in
vexa
tion
.
then
she
sighed
loudly
and
catching
her
breath
more
and
more
quickly
began
to
sob
.
what
is
it
whats
the
matter
oh
i
am
so
happy
she
replied
smiled
through
her
tears
bent
over
closer
to
him
paused
for
an
instant
as
if
asking
herself
wheth
er
she
might
and
then
kissed
him
.
prince
andrew
held
her
hands
looked
into
her
eyes
and
did
not
find
in
his
heart
his
former
love
for
her
.
something
in
him
had
suddenly
changed
there
was
no
longer
the
former
poetic
and
mystic
charm
of
desire
but
there
was
pity
for
her
feminine
and
childish
weakness
fear
at
her
devotion
and
trustfulness
and
an
op
pressive
yet
joyful
sense
of
the
duty
that
now
bound
him
to
her
forever
.
the
present
feeling
though
not
so
bright
and
poetic
as
the
former
was
stronger
and
more
serious
.
did
your
mother
tell
you
that
it
cannot
be
for
a
year
asked
prince
andrew
still
looking
into
her
eyes
.
is
it
possible
that
i
the
chit
of
a
girl
as
everybody
called
me
thought
natdsha
is
it
possible
that
i
am
now
to
be
the
wife
and
the
equal
of
this
strange
dear
clever
man
whom
even
my
father
looks
up
to
can
it
be
true
can
it
be
true
that
there
can
be
no
more
play
ing
with
life
that
now
i
am
grown
up
that
on
me
now
lies
a
responsibility
for
my
every
word
and
deed
yes
but
what
did
he
ask
me
no
she
replied
but
she
had
not
under
stood
his
question
.
forgive
mel
he
said
.
but
you
areso
young
and
i
have
already
been
through
so
much
in
life
.
i
am
afraid
for
you
you
do
not
yet
know
yourself
.
natasha
listened
wtih
concentrated
atten
tion
trying
but
failing
to
take
in
the
meaning
of
his
words
.
hard
as
this
year
which
delays
my
happi
ness
will
be
continued
prince
andrew
it
will
give
you
time
to
be
sure
of
yourself
.
i
ask
you
to
make
me
happy
in
a
year
but
you
are
270
war
and
peace
free
our
engagement
shall
remain
a
secret
and
should
you
find
that
you
do
not
love
me
or
should
you
come
to
love

..
.
said
prince
andrew
with
an
unnatural
smile
.
why
do
you
say
that
natdsha
interrupted
him
.
you
know
that
from
the
very
day
you
first
came
to
otrddnoe
i
have
loved
you
she
cried
quite
convinced
that
she
spoke
the
truth
.
in
a
year
you
will
learn
to
know
your
self
.

.

.

.
a
whole
year
natasha
repeated
suddenly
only
now
realizing
that
the
marriage
was
to
be
postponed
for
a
year
.
but
why
a
year
why
a
year

.

.

.
prince
andrew
began
to
explain
to
her
the
reasons
for
this
delay
.
natasha
did
not
hear
him
.
and
cant
it
be
helped
she
asked
.
prince
andrew
did
not
reply
but
his
face
expressed
the
impossibility
of
altering
that
decision
.
its
awful
oh
its
awful
awful
natdsha
suddenly
cried
and
again
burst
into
sobs
.
i
shall
die
waiting
a
year
its
impossible
its
aw
ful
she
looked
into
her
lovers
face
and
saw
in
it
a
look
of
commiseration
and
perplexity
.
no
no
ill
do
anything
she
said
sudden
ly
checking
her
tears
.
i
am
so
happy
.
the
father
and
mother
came
into
the
room
and
gave
the
betrothed
couple
their
blessing
.
from
that
day
prince
andrew
began
to
fre
quent
the
rost6vs
as
natdshas
affianced
lover
.
chapter
xxiv
no
betrothal
ceremony
took
place
and
na
tdshas
engagement
to
bolk6nski
was
not
an
nounced
prince
andrew
insisted
on
that
.
he
said
that
as
he
was
responsible
for
the
delay
he
ought
to
bear
the
whole
burden
of
it
that
he
had
given
his
word
and
bound
himself
forever
but
that
he
did
not
wish
to
bind
natdsha
and
gave
her
perfect
freedom
.
if
after
six
months
she
felt
that
she
did
not
love
him
she
would
have
full
right
to
reject
him
.
naturally
neither
natasha
nor
her
parents
wished
to
hear
of
this
but
prince
andrew
was
firm
.
he
came
every
day
to
the
rost6vs
but
did
not
behave
to
na
tdsha
as
an
affianced
lover
he
did
not
use
the
familiar
thou
but
said
you
to
her
and
kissed
only
her
hand
.
after
their
engagement
quite
different
intimate
and
natural
relations
sprang
up
between
them
.
it
was
as
if
they
had
not
known
each
other
till
now
.
both
liked
to
re
call
how
they
had
regarded
each
other
when
as
yet
they
were
nothing
to
one
another
they
felt
themselves
now
quite
different
beings
then
they
were
artificial
now
natural
and
sin
cere
.
at
first
the
family
felt
some
constraint
in
intercourse
with
prince
andrew
he
seemed
a
man
from
another
world
and
for
a
long
time
natdsha
trained
the
family
to
get
used
to
him
proudly
assuring
them
all
that
he
only
ap
peared
to
be
different
but
was
really
just
like
all
of
them
and
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
him
and
no
one
else
ought
to
be
.
after
a
few
days
they
grew
accustomed
to
him
and
without
re
straint
in
his
presence
pursued
their
usual
way
of
life
in
which
he
took
his
part
.
he
could
talk
about
rural
economy
with
the
count
fashions
with
the
countess
and
natdsha
and
about
al
bums
and
fancywork
with
s6nya
.
sometimes
the
household
both
among
themselves
and
in
his
presence
expressed
their
wonder
at
how
it
had
all
happened
and
at
the
evident
omens
there
had
been
of
it
prince
andrews
coming
to
otrddnoe
and
their
coming
to
petersburg
and
the
likeness
between
natdsha
and
prince
andrew
which
her
nurse
had
noticed
on
his
first
visit
and
andrews
encounter
with
nich
olas
in
1805
and
many
other
incidents
beto
kening
that
it
had
to
be
.
in
the
house
that
poetic
dullness
and
quiet
reigned
which
always
accompanies
the
pres
ence
of
a
betrothed
couple
.
often
when
all
sit
ting
together
everyone
kept
silent
.
sometimes
the
others
would
get
up
and
go
away
and
the
couple
left
alone
still
remained
silent
.
they
rarely
spoke
of
their
future
life
.
prince
an
drew
was
afraid
and
ashamed
to
speak
of
it
.
natdsha
shared
this
as
she
did
all
his
feelings
which
she
constantly
divined
.
once
she
began
questioning
him
about
his
son
.
prince
andrew
blushed
as
he
often
did
now
natdsha
particu
larly
liked
it
in
him
and
said
that
his
son
would
not
live
with
them
.
why
not
asked
natdsha
in
a
frightened
tone
.
i
cannot
take
him
away
from
his
grand
father
and
besides

.

.

.
how
i
should
have
loved
him
said
na
tdsha
immediately
guessing
his
thought
but
i
know
you
wish
to
avoid
any
pretext
for
find
ing
fault
with
us
.
sometimes
the
old
count
would
come
up
kiss
prince
andrew
and
ask
his
advice
about
pe
tyas
education
or
nicholas
service
.
the
old
countess
sighed
as
she
looked
at
them
s6nya
was
always
getting
frightened
lest
she
should
be
in
the
way
and
tried
to
find
excuses
for
leav
ing
them
alone
even
when
they
did
not
wish
it
.
when
prince
andrew
spoke
he
could
tell
a
story
very
well
natdsha
listened
to
him
with
pride
when
she
spoke
she
noticed
with
fear
book
six
271
and
joy
that
he
gazed
attentively
and
scruti
nizingly
at
her
.
she
asked
herself
in
perplexity
what
does
he
look
for
in
me
he
is
trying
to
discover
something
by
looking
at
me
what
if
what
he
seeks
in
me
is
not
there
sometimes
she
fell
into
one
of
the
mad
merry
moods
char
acteristic
of
her
and
then
she
particularly
loved
to
hear
and
see
how
prince
andrew
laughed
.
he
seldom
laughed
but
when
he
did
he
aban
doned
himself
entirely
to
his
laughter
and
aft
er
such
a
laugh
she
always
felt
nearer
to
him
.
natdsha
would
have
been
completely
happy
if
the
thought
of
the
separation
awaiting
her
and
drawing
near
had
not
terrified
her
just
as
the
mere
thought
of
it
made
him
turn
pale
and
cold
.
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
from
petersburg
prince
andrew
brought
with
him
pierre
who
had
not
been
to
the
rostovs
once
since
the
ball
.
pierre
seemed
disconcerted
and
embar
rassed
.
he
was
talking
to
the
countess
and
na
tdsha
sat
down
beside
a
little
chess
table
with
s6nya
thereby
inviting
prince
andrew
to
come
too
.
he
did
so
.
you
have
known
bezukhov
a
long
time
he
asked
.
do
you
like
him
yes
hes
a
dear
but
very
absurd
.
and
as
usual
when
speaking
of
pierre
she
began
to
tell
anecdotes
of
his
absentminded
ness
some
of
which
had
even
been
invented
about
him
.
do
you
know
i
have
entrusted
him
with
our
secret
i
have
known
him
from
childhood
.
he
has
a
heart
of
gold
.
i
beg
you
natalie
prince
andrew
said
with
sudden
seriousness
i
am
going
away
and
heaven
knows
what
may
hap
pen
.
you
may
cease
to

..
.
all
right
i
know
i
am
not
to
say
that
.
only
this
then
whatever
may
happen
to
you
when
i
am
not
here

.

.

.
what
can
happen
whatever
trouble
may
come
prince
an
drew
continued
i
beg
you
mademoiselle
sophie
whatever
may
happen
to
turn
to
him
alone
for
advice
and
helpl
he
is
a
most
absent
minded
and
absurd
fellow
but
he
has
a
heart
of
gold
.
neither
her
father
nor
her
mother
nor
s6n
ya
nor
prince
andrew
himself
could
have
fore
seen
how
the
separation
from
her
lover
would
act
on
natdsha
.
flushed
and
agitated
she
went
about
the
house
all
that
day
dryeyed
occupied
with
most
trivial
matters
as
if
not
understand
ing
what
awaited
her
.
she
did
not
even
cry
when
on
taking
leave
he
kissed
her
hand
for
the
last
time
.
dont
gol
she
said
in
a
tone
that
made
him
wonder
whether
he
really
ought
not
to
stay
and
which
he
remembered
long
aft
erwards
.
nor
did
she
cry
when
he
was
gone
but
for
several
days
she
sat
in
her
room
dry
eyed
taking
no
interest
in
anything
and
only
saying
now
and
then
oh
why
did
he
go
but
a
fortnight
after
his
departure
to
the
surprise
of
those
around
her
she
recovered
from
her
mental
sickness
just
as
suddenly
and
became
her
old
self
again
but
with
a
change
in
her
moral
physiognomy
as
a
child
gets
up
after
a
long
illness
with
a
changed
expression
of
face
.

.
he
grew
still
more
irri
table
and
it
was
princess
mary
who
generally
bore
the
brunt
of
his
frequent
fits
of
unpro
voked
anger
.
he
seemed
carefully
to
seek
out
her
tender
spots
so
as
to
torture
her
mentally
as
harshly
as
possible
.
princess
mary
had
two
passions
and
consequently
two
joys
her
neph
ew
little
nicholas
and
religion
and
these
were
the
favorite
subjects
of
the
princes
at
tacks
and
ridicule
.
whatever
was
spoken
of
he
would
bring
round
to
the
superstitiousness
of
old
maids
or
the
petting
and
spoiling
of
chil
dren
.
you
want
to
make
him
little
nicholas
into
an
old
maid
like
yourselfl
a
pity
prince
andrew
wants
a
son
and
not
an
old
maid
he
would
say
.
or
turning
to
mademoi
selle
bourienne
he
would
ask
her
in
princess
marys
presence
how
she
liked
our
village
priests
and
icons
and
would
joke
about
them
.
he
continually
hurt
princess
marys
feelings
and
tormented
her
but
it
cost
her
no
effort
to
forgive
him
.
could
he
be
to
blame
toward
her
or
could
her
father
whom
she
knew
loved
her
in
spite
of
it
all
be
unjust
and
what
is
justice
the
princess
never
thought
of
that
proud
word
justice
.
all
the
complex
laws
of
man
cen
tered
for
her
in
one
clear
and
simple
law
the
law
of
love
and
selfsacrifice
taught
us
by
him
who
lovingly
suffered
for
mankind
though
he
himself
was
god
.
what
had
she
to
do
with
the
justice
or
injustice
of
other
people
she
had
to
endure
and
love
and
that
she
did
.
during
the
winter
prince
andrew
had
come
to
bald
hills
and
had
been
gay
gentle
and
more
affectionate
than
princess
mary
had
known
him
for
a
long
time
past
.
she
felt
that
something
had
happened
to
him
but
he
said
nothing
to
her
about
his
love
.
before
he
left
he
had
a
long
talk
with
his
father
about
some
war
and
peace
thing
and
princess
mary
noticed
that
before
his
departure
they
were
dissatisfied
with
one
another
.
soon
after
prince
andrew
had
gone
prin
cess
mary
wrote
to
her
friend
julie
karagina
in
petersburg
whom
she
had
dreamed
as
ab
girls
dream
of
marrying
to
her
brother
and
who
was
at
that
time
in
mourning
for
her
own
brother
killed
in
turkey
.
sorrow
it
seems
is
our
common
lot
my
dear
tender
friend
julie
.
your
loss
is
so
terrible
that
i
can
only
explain
it
to
myself
as
a
special
providence
of
god
who
lov
ing
you
wishes
to
try
you
and
your
excellent
mother
.
oh
my
friend
religion
and
religion
alone
cani
will
not
say
comfort
us
but
save
us
from
despair
.
religion
alone
can
explain
to
us
what
without
its
help
man
cannot
comprehend
why
for
what
cause
kind
and
noble
beings
able
to
find
happiness
in
lifenot
merely
harming
no
one
but
necessary
to
the
happiness
of
others
are
called
away
to
god
while
cruel
useless
harmful
persons
or
such
as
are
a
burden
to
themselves
and
to
others
are
left
living
.
the
first
death
i
saw
and
one
i
shall
never
forget
that
of
my
dear
sis
terinlawleft
that
impression
on
me
.
just
as
you
ask
destiny
why
your
splendid
brother
had
to
die
so
i
asked
why
that
angel
lise
who
not
only
never
wronged
anyone
but
in
whose
soul
there
were
never
any
unkind
thoughts
had
to
die
.
and
what
do
you
think
dear
friend
five
years
have
passed
since
then
and
already
i
with
my
petty
under
standing
begin
to
see
clearly
why
she
had
to
die
and
in
what
way
that
death
was
but
an
expression
of
the
infinite
goodness
of
the
creator
whose
every
action
though
generally
incomprehensible
to
us
is
but
a
manifestation
of
his
infinite
love
for
his
creatures
.
perhaps
i
often
think
she
was
too
angelically
innocent
to
have
the
strength
to
perform
all
a
mothers
duties
.
as
a
young
wife
she
was
irreproachable
perhaps
she
could
not
have
been
so
as
a
mother
.
as
it
is
not
only
has
she
left
us
and
particularly
prince
andrew
with
the
pur
est
regrets
and
memories
but
probably
she
will
there
receive
a
place
i
dare
not
hope
for
myself
.
but
not
to
speak
of
her
alone
that
early
and
ter
rible
death
has
had
the
most
beneficent
influence
on
me
and
on
my
brother
in
spite
of
all
our
grief
.
then
at
the
moment
of
our
loss
these
thoughts
could
not
occur
to
me
i
should
then
have
dis
missed
them
with
horror
but
now
they
are
very
dear
and
certain
.
i
write
all
this
to
you
dear
friend
only
to
convince
you
of
the
gospel
truth
which
has
become
for
me
a
principle
of
life
not
a
single
hair
of
our
heads
will
fall
without
his
will
.
and
his
will
is
governed
only
by
infinite
love
for
us
and
so
whatever
befalls
us
is
for
our
good
.
you
ask
whether
we
shall
spend
next
winter
in
moscow
.
in
spite
of
my
wish
to
see
you
i
do
not
think
so
and
do
not
want
to
do
so
.
you
will
be
sur
prised
to
hear
that
the
reason
for
this
is
buona
parte
the
case
is
this
my
fathers
health
is
grow
ing
noticeably
worse
he
cannot
stand
any
contra
diction
and
is
becoming
irritable
.
this
irritability
is
as
you
know
chiefly
directed
to
political
ques
tions
.
he
cannot
endure
the
notion
that
buona
parte
is
negotiating
on
equal
terms
with
all
the
sovereigns
of
europe
and
particularly
with
our
own
the
grandson
of
the
great
catherine
as
you
know
i
am
quite
indifferent
to
politics
but
from
my
fathers
remarks
and
his
talks
with
michael
ivanovich
i
know
all
that
goes
on
in
the
world
and
especially
about
the
honors
conferred
on
buonaparte
who
only
at
bald
hills
in
the
whole
world
it
seems
is
not
accepted
as
a
great
man
still
less
as
emperor
of
france
.
and
my
father
can
not
stand
this
.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
chiefly
because
of
his
political
views
that
my
father
is
re
luctant
to
speak
of
going
to
moscow
for
he
fore
sees
the
encounters
that
would
result
from
his
way
of
expressing
his
views
regardless
of
anybody
.
all
the
benefit
he
might
derive
from
a
course
of
treat
ment
he
would
lose
as
a
result
of
the
disputes
about
buonaparte
which
would
be
inevitable
.
in
any
case
it
will
be
decided
very
shortly
.
our
family
life
goes
on
in
the
old
way
except
for
my
brother
andrews
absence
.
he
as
i
wrote
you
before
has
changed
very
much
of
late
.
after
liis
sorrow
he
only
this
year
quite
recovered
his
spirits
.
he
has
again
become
as
i
used
to
know
him
when
a
child
kind
affectionate
with
that
heart
of
gold
to
which
i
know
no
equal
.
he
has
realized
it
seems
to
me
that
life
is
not
over
for
him
.
but
together
with
this
mental
change
he
has
grown
physically
much
weaker
.
he
has
become
thinner
and
more
nervous
.
i
am
anxious
about
him
and
glad
he
is
taking
this
trip
abroad
which
the
doctors
recommended
long
ago
.
i
hope
it
will
cure
him
.
you
write
that
in
petersburg
he
is
spoken
of
as
one
of
the
most
active
cultivated
and
capable
of
the
young
men
.
forgive
my
vanity
as
a
relation
but
i
never
doubted
it
.
the
good
he
has
done
to
everybody
here
from
his
peasants
up
to
the
gentry
is
incalculable
.
on
his
arrival
in
peters
burg
he
received
only
his
due
.
i
always
wonder
at
the
way
rumors
fly
from
petersburg
to
moscow
es
pecially
such
false
ones
as
that
you
write
about
i
mean
the
report
of
my
brothers
betrothal
to
the
little
rostova
.
i
do
not
think
my
brother
will
ever
marry
again
and
certainly
not
her
and
this
is
why
first
i
know
that
though
he
rarely
speaks
about
the
wife
he
has
lost
the
grief
of
that
loss
has
gone
too
deep
in
his
heart
for
him
ever
to
decide
to
give
her
a
successor
and
our
little
angel
a
step
mother
.
secondly
because
as
far
as
i
know
that
girl
is
not
the
kind
of
girl
who
could
please
prince
andrew
.
i
do
not
think
he
would
choose
her
for
a
wife
and
frankly
i
do
not
wish
it
.
but
i
am
run
ning
on
too
long
and
am
at
the
end
of
my
second
sheet
.
goodby
my
dear
friend
.
may
god
keep
you
in
his
holy
and
mighty
care
.
my
dear
friend
mademoiselle
bourienne
sends
you
kisses

chapter
xxvi
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
princess
mary
re
ceived
an
unexpected
letter
from
prince
an
drew
in
switzerland
in
which
he
gave
her
strange
and
surprising
news
.
he
informed
her
of
his
engagement
to
natasha
rostova
.
the
whole
letter
breathed
loving
rapture
for
his
betrothed
and
tender
and
confiding
affection
for
his
sister
.
he
wrote
that
he
had
never
loved
as
he
did
now
and
that
only
now
did
he
under
stand
and
know
what
life
was
.
he
asked
his
sister
to
forgive
him
for
not
having
told
her
of
his
resolve
when
he
had
last
visited
bald
hills
though
he
had
spoken
of
it
to
his
father
.
he
had
not
done
so
for
fear
princess
mary
should
ask
her
father
to
give
his
consent
irritating
him
and
having
to
bear
the
brunt
of
his
dis
pleasure
without
attaining
her
object
.
be
sides
he
wrote
the
matter
was
not
then
so
definitely
settled
as
it
is
now
.
my
father
then
insisted
on
a
delay
of
a
year
and
now
already
six
months
half
of
that
period
have
passed
and
my
resolution
is
firmer
than
ever
.
if
the
doctors
did
not
keep
me
here
at
the
spas
i
should
be
back
in
russia
but
as
it
is
i
have
to
postpone
my
return
for
three
months
.
you
know
me
and
my
relations
with
father
.
i
want
nothing
from
him
.
i
have
been
and
always
shall
be
independent
but
to
go
against
his
will
and
arouse
his
anger
now
that
he
may
perhaps
remain
with
us
such
a
short
time
would
de
stroy
half
my
happiness
.
i
am
now
writing
to
him
about
the
same
question
and
beg
you
to
choose
a
good
moment
to
hand
him
the
let
ter
and
to
let
me
know
how
he
looks
at
the
whole
matter
and
whether
there
is
hope
that
he
may
consent
to
reduce
the
term
by
four
months
.
after
long
hesitations
doubts
and
prayers
princess
mary
gave
the
letter
to
her
father
.
the
next
day
the
old
prince
said
to
her
quietly
write
and
tell
your
brother
to
wait
till
i
am
dead
.

..
.
it
wont
be
long
i
shall
soon
set
him

the
princess
was
about
to
reply
but
her
fa
ther
would
not
let
her
speak
and
raising
his
voice
more
and

cried

after

outburst
the
prince
did
not
speak
any
more
about
the

but
repressed
vex
ation
at
his
sons

found
expression
in

treatment

to
his

now
added

asked

shell

and
latterly
to
her
surprise
and
bewilder
ment
princess
mary
noticed
that
her
father
was
really
associating
more
and
more
with
the
frenchwoman
.
she
wrote
to
prince
andrew
about
the
reception
of
his
letter
but
comforted
him
with
hopes
of
reconciling
their
father
to
the
idea
.
little
nicholas
and
his
education
herbroth
er
andrew
and
religion
were
princess
marys
joys
and
consolations
but
besides
that
since
everyone
must
have
personal
hopes
princess
mary
in
the
profoundest
depths
of
her
heart
had
a
hidden
dream
and
hope
that
supplied
the
chief
consolation
of
her
life
.
this
comfort
ing
dream
and
hope
were
given
her
by
gods
folk
the
halfwitted
and
other
pilgrims
who
visited
her
without
the
princes
knowledge
.
the
longer
she
lived
the
more
experience
and
observation
she
had
of
life
the
greater
was
her
wonder
at
the
shortsightedness
of
men
who
seek
enjoyment
and
happiness
here
on
earth
toil
ing
suffering
struggling
and
harming
one
an
other
to
obtain
that
impossible
visionary
sin
ful
happiness
.
prince
andrew
had
loved
his
wife
she
died
but
that
was
riot
enough
he
wanted
to
bind
his
happiness
to
another
wom
an
.
her
father
objected
to
this
because
he
wanted
a
more
distinguished
and
wealthier
match
for
andrew
.
and
they
all
struggled
and
suffered
and
tormented
one
another
and
in
jured
their
souls
their
eternal
souls
for
the
at
tainment
of
benefits
which
endure
but
for
an
instant
.
not
only
do
we
know
this
ourselves
but
christ
the
son
of
god
came
down
to
earth
and
told
us
that
this
life
is
but
for
a
moment
and
is
a
probation
yet
we
cling
to
it
and
think
to
find
happiness
in
it
.
how
is
it
that
no
one
realizes
this
thought
princess
mary
.
no
one
except
these
despised
gods
folk
who
wallet
on
back
come
to
me
by
the
back
door
afraid
of
being
seen
by
the
prince
not
for
fear
of
ill
usage
by
him
but
for
fear
of
causing
him
to
sin

to
leave
family
home
and
all
the
cares
of

war
and
peace
worldly
welfare
in
order
without

anything

wander
in
hempen
rags
from

to

under
an
assumed
name

no

for
all

as
for
those
who
pro

higher
than

and
truth
there
is
no

there
was
one
pilgrim
a
quiet
pockmarked
little
woman
of
fifty
called
theodosia
who
for
over
thirty
years
had
gone
about
barefoot
and
worn
heavy
chains
.
princess
mary
was
particu
larly
fond
of
her
.
once
when
in
a
room
with
a
lamp
dimly
lit
before
the
icon
theodosia
was
talking
of
her
life
the
thought
that
theodosia
alone
had
found
the
true
path
of
life
suddenly
came
to
princess
mary
with
such
force
that
she
resolved
to
become
a
pilgrim
herself
.
when
theodosia
had
gone
to
sleep
princess
mary
thought
about
this
for
a
long
time
and
at
last
made
up
her
mind
that
strange
as
it
might
seem
she
must
go
on
a
pilgrimage
.
she
dis
closed
this
thought
to
no
one
but
to
her
con
fessor
father
akfnfi
the
monk
and
he
ap
proved
of
her
intention
.
under
guise
of
a
pres
ent
for
the
pilgrims
princess
mary
prepared
a
pilgrims
complete
costume
for
herself
a
coarse
smock
bast
shoes
a
rough
coat
and
a
black
kerchief
.
often
approaching
the
chest
of
drawers
containing

secret
treasure

paused
uncertain

book

i

bible
legend
tells
us
that
the
absence
of
laboridleness
was
a
condition
of
the
first
mans
blessedness
before
the
fall
.
fallen
man
has
retained
a
love
of
idleness
but
the
curse
weighs
on
the
race
not
only
because
we
have
to
seek
our
bread
in
the
sweat
of
our
brows
but
because
our
moral
nature
is
such
that
we
can
not
be
both
idle
and
at
ease
.
an
inner
voice
tells
us
we
are
in
the
wrong
if
we
are
idle
.
if
man
could
find
a
state
in
which
he
felt
that
though
idle
he
was
fulfilling
his
duty
he
would
have
found
one
of
the
conditions
of
mans
primitive
blessedness
.
and
such
a
state
of
obli
gatory
and
irreproachable
idleness
is
the
lot
of
a
whole
class
the
military
.
the
chief
attrac
tion
of
military
service
has
consisted
and
will
consist
in
this
compulsory
and
irreproachable
idleness
.
nicholas
rost6v
experienced
this
blissful
condition
to
the
full
when
after
1807
he
con
tinued
to
serve
in
the
pdvlograd
regiment
in
which
he
already
commanded
the
squadron
he
had
taken
over
from
denfsov
.
rost6v
had
become
a
bluff
goodnatured
fellow
whom
his
moscow
acquaintances
would
have
considered
rather
bad
form
but
who
was
liked
and
respected
by
his
comrades
subordi
nates
and
superiors
and
was
well
contented
with
his
life
.
of
late
in
1809
he
found
in
let
ters
from
home
more
frequent
complaints
from
his
mother
that
their
affairs
were
falling
into
greater
and
greater
disorder
and
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
come
back
to
gladden
and
com
fort
his
old
parents
.
reading
these
letters
nicholas
felt
a
dread
of
their
wanting
to
take
him
away
from
sur
roundings
in
which
protected
from
all
the
en
tanglements
of
life
he
was
living
so
calmly
and
quietly
.
he
felt
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
have
to
reenter
that
whirlpool
of
life
with
its
embarrassments
and
affairs
to
be
straightened
out
its
accounts
with
stewards
quarrels
and
intrigues
its
ties
society
and
with
s6nyas
love
and
his
promise
to
her
.
it
was
all
dreadfully
difficult
and
complicated
and
he
replied
to
his
mother
in
cold
formal
letters
in
french
begin
ning
my
dear
mamma
and
ending
your
obedient
son
which
said
nothing
of
when
he
would
return
.
in
1810
he
received
letters
from
his
parents
in
which
they
told
him
of
natashas
engagement
to
bolk6nski
and
that
the
wed
ding
would
be
in
a
years
time
because
the
old
prince
made
difficulties
.
this
letter
grieved
and
mortified
nicholas
.
in
the
first
place
he
was
sorry
that
natdsha
for
whom
he
cared
more
than
for
anyone
else
in
the
family
should
be
lost
to
the
home
and
secondly
from
his
hussar
point
of
view
he
regretted
not
to
have
been
there
to
show
that
fellow
bolk6nski
that
connection
with
him
was
no
such
great
honor
after
all
and
that
if
he
loved
natdsha
he
might
dispense
with
permission
from
his
dotard
fa
ther
.
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
whether
he
should
not
apply
for
leave
in
order
to
see
na
tdsha
before
she
was
married
but
then
came
the
maneuvers
and
considerations
about
s6n
ya
and
about
the
confusion
of
their
affairs
and
nicholas
again
put
it
off
.
but
in
the
spring
of
that
year
he
received
a
letter
from
his
mother
written
without
his
fathers
knowledge
and
that
letter
persuaded
him
to
return
.
she
wrote
that
if
he
did
not
come
and
take
matters
in
hand
their
whole
property
would
be
sold
by
auction
and
they
would
all
have
to
go
begging
.
the
count
was
so
weak
and
trusted
mftenka
so
much
and
was
so
goodnatured
that
every
body
took
advantage
of
him
and
things
were
going
from
bad
to
worse
.
for
gods
sake
i
implore
you
come
at
once
if
you
do
not
wish
to
make
me
and
the
whole
family
wretched
wrote
the
countess
.
this
letter
touched
nicholas
.
he
had
that
common
sense
of
a
matteroffact
man
which
showed
him
what
he
ought
to
do
.
the
right
thing
now
was
if
not
to
retire
from
the
service
at
any
rate
to
go
home
on
leave
.
why
he
had
to
go
he
did
not
know
but
after
his
afterdinner
nap
he
gave
orders
to
saddle
mars
an
extremely
vicious
gray
stallion
75
276
that
had
not
been
ridden
for
a
long
time
and
when
he
returned
with
the
horse
all
in
a
lather
he
informed
lavriishka
denfsovs
servant
who
had
remained
with
him
and
his
comrades
who
turned
up
in
the
evening
that
he
was
ap
plying
for
leave
and
was
going
home
.
difficult
and
strange
as
it
was
for
him
to
reflect
that
he
would
go
away
without
having
heard
from
the
staff
and
this
interested
him
extremely
whether
he
was
promoted
to
a
captaincy
or
would
receive
the
order
of
st
.
anne
for
the
last
maneuvers
strange
as
it
was
to
think
that
he
would
go
away
without
having
sold
his
three
roans
to
the
polish
count
golukhovski
who
was
bargaining
for
the
horses
rost6v
had
betted
he
would
sell
for
two
thousand
rubles
incomprehensible
as
it
seemed
that
the
ball
the
hussars
were
giving
in
honor
of
the
polish
mademoiselle
przazdziecka
out
of
rivalry
to
the
uhlans
who
had
given
one
in
honor
of
their
polish
mademoiselle
borzozowska
would
take
place
without
him
he
knew
he
must
go
away
from
this
good
bright
world
to
some
where
where
everything
was
stupid
and
con
fused
.
a
week
later
he
obtained
his
leave
.
his
hussar
comrades
not
only
those
of
his
own
regiment
but
the
whole
brigade
gave
rostov
a
dinner
to
which
the
subscription
was
fifteen
rubles
a
head
and
at
which
there
were
two
bands
and
two
choirs
of
singers
.
rost6v
danced
the
trepak
with
major
basov
the
tipsy
officers
tossed
embraced
and
dropped
rostcw
the
soldiers
of
the
third
squadron
tossed
him
too
and
shouted
hurrah
and
then
they
put
him
in
his
sleigh
and
escorted
him
as
far
as
the
first
post
station
.
during
the
first
half
of
the
journey
from
kremenchug
to
kiev
all
rost6vs
thoughts
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
were
behind
him
with
the
squadron
but
when
he
had
gone
more
than
halfway
he
began
to
forget
his
three
roans
and
dozhoyveyko
his
quartermaster
and
to
won
der
anxiously
how
things
would
be
at
otrad
noe
and
what
he
would
find
there
.
thoughts
of
home
grew
stronger
the
nearer
he
approached
it
far
stronger
as
though
this
feeling
of
his
was
subject
to
the
law
by
which
the
force
of
at
traction
is
in
inverse
proportion
to
the
square
of
the
distance
.
at
the
last
post
station
before
otrddnoe
he
gave
the
driver
a
threeruble
tip
and
on
arriving
he
ran
breathlessly
like
a
boy
up
the
steps
of
his
home
.
after
the
rapture
of
meeting
and
after
that
odd
feeling
of
unsatisfied
expectation
the
feeling
that
everything
is
just
the
same
so
war
and
peace
down
in
his
old
home
world
.
his
father
and
mother
were
much
the
same
only
a
little
older
.
what
was
new
in
them
was
a
certain
uneasi
ness
and
occasional
discord
which
there
used
not
to
be
and
which
as
nicholas
soon
found
out
was
due
to
the
bad
state
of
their
affairs
.
s6nya
was
nearly
twenty
she
had
stopped
growing
prettier
and
promised
nothing
more
than
she
was
already
but
that
was
enough
.
she
exhaled
happiness
and
love
from
the
time
nicholas
returned
and
the
faithful
unalter
able
love
of
this
girl
had
a
gladdening
effect
on
hirn
.
pkya
and
natasha
surprised
nicholas
most
.
pctya
was
a
big
handsome
boy
of
thir
teen
merry
witty
and
mischievous
with
a
voice
that
was
already
breaking
.
as
for
nata
sha
for
a
long
while
nicholas
wondered
and
laughed
whenever
he
looked
at
her
.
youre
not
the
same
at
all
he
said
.
how
am
i
uglier
on
the
contrary
but
what
dignityl
a
prin
cess
he
whispered
to
her
.
yes
.
yes
yes
cried
natasha
joyfully
.
she
told
him
about
her
romance
with
prince
andrew
and
of
his
visit
to
otrddnoe
and
showed
him
his
last
letter
.
well
are
you
glad
natdsha
asked
.
i
am
so
tranquil
and
happy
now
.
very
glad
answered
nicholas
.
he
is
an
excellent
fellow
and
are
you
very
much
in
love
how
shall
i
put
it
replied
natdsha
.
i
was
in
love
with
boris
with
my
teacher
and
with
denisov
but
this
is
quite
different
.
i
feel
at
peace
and
settled
.
i
know
that
no
better
man
than
he
exists
and
i
am
calm
and
con
tented
now
.
not
at
all
as
before
.
nicholas
expressed
his
disapproval
of
the
postponement
of
the
marriage
for
a
year
but
natdsha
attacked
her
brother
with
exaspera
tion
proving
to
him
that
it
could
not
be
oth
erwise
and
that
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
to
en
ter
a
family
against
the
fathers
will
and
that
she
herself
wished
it
so
.
you
dont
at
all
understand
she
said
.
nicholas
was
silent
and
agreed
with
her
.
her
brother
often
wondered
as
he
looked
at
her
.
she
did
not
seem
at
all
like
a
girl
in
love
and
parted
from
her
affianced
husband
.
she
was
eventempered
and
calm
and
quite
as
cheerful
as
of
old
.
this
amazed
nicholas
and
even
made
him
regard
bolk6nskis
courtship
skeptically
.
he
could
not
believe
that
her
fate
was
sealed
especially
as
he
had
not
seen
her
with
prince
andrew
.
it
always
seemed
why
did
i
hurry
nicholas
began
to
settle
to
him
that
there
was
something
not
quite
right
about
this
intended
marriage
.
why
this
delay
why
no
betrothal
he
thought
.
once
when
he
had
touched
on
this
topic
with
his
mother
he
discovered
to
his
sur
prise
and
somewhat
to
his
satisfaction
that
in
the
depth
of
her
soul
she
too
had
doubts
about
this
marriage
.
you
see
he
writes
said
she
showing
her
son
a
letter
of
prince
andrews
with
that
la
tent
grudge
a
mother
always
has
in
regard
to
a
daughters
future
married
happiness
he
writes
that
he
wont
come
before
december
.
what
can
be
keeping
him
illness
probably
his
health
is
very
delicate
.
dont
tell
natdsha
.
and
dont
attach
importance
to
her
being
so
bright
thats
because
shes
living
through
the
last
days
of
her
girlhood
but
i
know
what
she
is
like
every
time
we
receive
a
letter
from
him
how
ever
god
grant
that
everything
turns
out
well
she
always
ended
with
these
words
.
he
is
an
excellent
man
chapter
ii
after
reaching
home
nicholas
was
at
first
serious
and
even
dull
.
he
was
worried
by
the
impending
necessity
of
interferinginthestupid
business
matters
for
which
his
mother
had
called
him
home
.
to
throw
off
this
burden
as
quickly
as
possible
on
the
third
day
after
his
arrival
he
went
angry
and
scowling
and
with
out
answering
questions
as
to
where
he
was
going
to
mitenkas
lodge
and
demanded
an
account
of
everything
.
but
what
an
account
of
everything
might
be

knew
even
less
than
the
frightened
and
bewildered
mitenka

then
with

they
saw

in

with

returning

from

town
used
to
hide
there
and
many
of
the
residents
at

hiding
from

knew
of

thrust
their
heads
and

faces
out
of
the
door
of
a
room
where
a
bright
samovar
was
boiling
and
where
the
stewards
high
bedstead
stood
with
its
patchwork
quilt
.
the
young
count
paid
no
heed
to
them
but
breathing
hard
passed
by
with
resolute
strides
and
went
into
the
house
.
the
countess
who
heard
at
once
from
the
maids
what
had
happened
at
the
lodge
was
calmed
by
the
thought
that
now
their
affairs
would
certainly
improve
but
on
the
other
hand
felt
anxious
as
to
the
effect
this
excite
ment
might
have
on
her
son
.
she
went
several
times
to
his
door
on
tiptoe
and
listened
as
he
lighted
one
pipe
after
another
.
next
day
the
old
count
called
his
son
aside
and
with
an
embarrassed
smile
said
to
him
but
you
know
my
dear
boy
its
a
pity

about
it

should
never

crazy

were
angry

i
have
caused
you
unpleasantness
.
i
understand
it
all
less
than
you
do
.
devil
take
all
these
peasants
and
money
matters
and
carryings
forward
from
page
to
page
he
thought
.
i
used
to
understand
what
a
corner
and
the
stakes
at
cards
meant
but
carrying
forward
to
another
page
i
dont
un
derstand
at
all
said
he
to
himself
and
after
that
he
did
not
meddle
in
business
affairs
.
but
once
the
countess
called
her
son
and
informed
him
that
she
had
a
promissory
note
from
anna
mikhdylovna
for
two
thousand
rubles
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
doing
with
it
.
this
answered
nicholas
.
you
say
it
rests
with
me
.
well
i
dont
like
anna
mikhdylov
na
and
i
dont
like
boris
but
they
were
our
278
war
and
peace
friends
and
poor
.
well
then
this
i
and
he
tore
up
the
note
and
by
so
doing
caused
the
old
countess
to
weep
tears
of
joy
.
after
that
young
rost6v
took
no
further
part
in
any
business
af
fairs
but
devoted
himself
with
passionate
en
thusiasm
to
what
was
to
him
a
new
pursuit
the
chase
for
which
his
father
kept
a
large
establishment
.
chapter
iii
the
weather
was
already
growing
wintry
and
morning
frosts
congealed
an
earth
saturated
by
autumn
rains
.
the
verdure
had
thickened
and
its
bright
green
stood
out
sharply
against
the
brownish
strips
of
winter
rye
trodden
down
by
the
cattle
and
against
the
paleyellow
stub
ble
of
the
spring
sowing
and
the
reddish
strips
of
buckwheat
.
the
wooded
ravines
and
the
copses
which
at
the
end
of
august
had
still
been
green
islands
amid
black
fields
and
stub
ble
had
become
golden
and
brightred
islands
amid
the
green
winter
rye
.
the
hares
had
al
ready
half
changed
their
summer
coats
the
fox
cubs
were
beginning
to
scatter
and
the
young
wolves
were
bigger
than
dogs
.
it
was
the
best
time
of
the
year
for
the
chase
.
the
hounds
of
that
ardent
young
sportsman
rostov
had
not
merely
reached
hard
winter
condition
but
were
so
jaded
that
at
a
meetingof
the
huntsmen
it
was
decided
to
give
them
a
three
days
rest
and
then
on
the
sixteenth
of
september
to
go
on
a
distant
expedition
starting
from
the
oak
grove
where
there
was
an
undisturbed
litter
of
wolf
cubs
.
all
that
day
the
hounds
remained
at
home
.
it
was
frosty
and
the
air
was
sharp
but
toward
evening
the
sky
became
overcast
and
it
began
to
thaw
.
on
the
fifteenth
when
young
rost6v
in
his
dressing
gown
looked
out
of
the
window
he
saw
it
was
an
unsurpassable
morning
for
hunting
it
was
as
if
the
sky
were
melting
and
sinking
to
the
earth
without
any
wind
.
the
only
motion
in
the
air
was
that
of
the
dripping
microscopic
particles
of
drizzling
mist
.
the
bare
twigs
in
the
garden
were
hung
with
trans
parent
drops
which
fell
on
the
freshly
fallen
leaves
.
the
earth
in
the
kitchen
garden
looked
wet
and
black
and
glistened
like
poppy
seed
and
at
a
short
distance
merged
into
the
dull
moist
veil
of
mist
.
nicholas
went
out
into
the
wet
and
muddy
porch
.
there
was
a
smell
of
decaying
leaves
and
of
dog
.
milka
a
black
spotted
broadhaunched
bitch
with
prominent
black
eyes
got
up
on
seeing
her
master
stretched
her
hind
legs
lay
down
like
a
hare
and
then
suddenly
jumped
up
and
licked
him
right
on
his
nose
and
mustache
.
another
bor
zoi
a
dog
catching
sight
of
his
master
from
the
garden
path
arched
his
back
and
rushing
headlong
toward
the
porch
with
lifted
tail
be
gan
rubbing
himself
against
his
legs
.
ohoy
came
at
that
moment
that
inimi
table
huntsmans
call
which
unites
the
deepest
bass
with
the
shrillest
tenor
and
round
the
corner
came
daniel
the
head
huntsman
and
head
kennelman
a
gray
wrinkled
old
man
with
hair
cut
straight
over
his
forehead
ukrain
ian
fashion
a
long
bent
whip
in
his
hand
and
that
look
of
independence
and
scorn
of
every
thing
that
is
only
seen
in
huntsmen
.
he
doffed
his
circassian
cap
to
his
master
and
looked
at
him
scornfully
.
this
scorn
was
not
offensive
to
his
master
.
nicholas
knew
that
this
daniel
dis
dainful
of
everybody
and
who
considered
him
self
above
them
was
all
the
same
his
serf
and
huntsman
.
daniel
nicholas
said
timidly
conscious
at
the
sight
of
the
weather
the
hounds
and
the
huntsman
that
he
was
being
carried
away
by
that
irresistible
passion
for
sport
which
makes
a
man
forget
all
his
previous
resolutions
as
a
lover
forgets
in
the
presence
of
his
mistress
.
what
orders
your
excellency
said
the
huntsman
in
his
deep
bass
deep
as
a
proto
deacons
and
hoarse
with
hallooing
and
two
flashing
black
eyes
gazed
from
under
his
brows
at
his
master
who
was
silent
.
can
you
resist
it
those
eyes
seemed
to
be
asking
.
its
a
good
day
eh
for
a
hunt
and
a
gallop
eh
asked
nicholas
scratching
mflka
behind
the
ears
.
daniel
did
not
answer
but
winked
instead
.
i
sent
uvrirka
at
dawn
to
listen
his
bass
boomed
out
after
a
minutes
pause
.
he
says
shes
moved
them
into
the
otradnoe
enclosure
.
they
were
howling
there
.
this
meant
that
the
shewolf
about
whom
they
both
knew
had
moved
with
her
cubs
to
the
otradnoe
copse
a
small
place
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
house
.
we
ought
to
go
dont
you
think
so
said
nicholas
.
come
to
me
with
uvrka
.
as
you
please
.
then
put
off
feeding
them
.
yes
sir
.
five
minutes
later
daniel
and
uvdrka
were
standing
in
nicholas
big
study
.
though
daniel
was
not
a
big
man
to
see
him
in
a
room
was
like
seeing
a
horse
or
a
bear
on
the
floor
among
the
furniture
and
surroundings
of
human
life
.
daniel
himself
felt
this
and
as
usual
stood
just
inside
the
door
trying
to
speak
softly
and
not
move
for
fear
of
breaking
something
in
the
book
seven
masters
apartment
and
he
hastened
to
say
all
that
was
necessary
so
as
to
get
from
under
that
ceiling
out
into
the
open
under
the
sky
once
more
.
having
finished
his
inquiries
and
extorted
from
daniel
an
opinion
that
the
hounds
were
fit
daniel
himself
wished
to
go
hunting
nich
olas
ordered
the
horses
to
be
saddled
.
but
just
as
daniel
was
about
to
go
natdsha
came
in
with
rapid
steps
not
having
done
up
her
hair
or
fin
ished
dressing
and
with
her
old
nurses
big
shawl
wrapped
round
her
.
petya
ran
in
at
the
same
time
.
you
are
going
asked
natdsha
.
i
knew
you
would
s6nya
said
you
wouldnt
go
but
i
knew
that
today
is
the
sort
of
day
when
you
couldnt
help
going
.
yes
we
are
going
replied
nicholas
reluc
tantly
for
today
as
he
intended
to
hunt
seri
ously
he
did
not
want
to
take
natasha
and
pet
ya
.
we
are
going
but
only
wolf
hunting
it
would
be
dull
for
you
.
you
know
it
is
my
greatest
pleasure
said
natdsha
.
its
not
fair
you
are
going
by
your
self
are
having
the
horses
saddled
and
said
nothing
to
us
about
it
.

no
barrier
bars
a
russians
path
well
go
shouted
pdtya
.
but
you
cant
.
mamma
said
you
mustnt
said
nicholas
to
natdsha
.
yes
ill
go
.
i
shall
certainly
go
said
na
tdsha
decisively
.
daniel
tell
them
to
saddle
for
us
and
michael
must
come
with
my
dogs
she
added
to
the
huntsman
.
it
seemed
to
daniel
irksome
and
improper
to
be
in
a
room
at
all
but
to
have
anything
to
do
with
a
young
lady
seemed
to
him
impossible
.
he
cast
down
his
eyes
and
hurried
out
as
if
it
were
none
of
his
business
careful
as
he
went
not
to
inflict
any
accidental
injury
on
the
young
lady
.
chapter
iv
the
old
count
who
had
always
kept
up
an
enormous
hunting
establishment
but
had
now
handed
it
all
completely
over
to
his
sons
care
being
in
very
good
spirits
on
this
fifteenth
of
september
prepared
to
go
out
with
the
others
.
in
an
hours
time
the
whole
hunting
party
was
at
the
porch
.
nicholas
with
a
stern
and
serious
air
which
showed
that
now
was
no
time
for
attending
to
trifles
went
past
natdsha
and
ptya
who
were
trying
to
tell
him
something
.
he
had
a
look
at
all
the
details
of
the
hunt
sent
a
pack
of
hounds
and
huntsmen
on
ahead
to
find
the
quarry
mounted
his
chestnut
done
ts
and
whistling
to
his
own
leash
of
borzois
set
off
across
the
threshing
ground
to
a
field
lead
ing
to
the
otrddnoe
wood
.
the
old
counts
horse
a
sorrel
gelding
called
viflydnka
was
led
by
the
groom
in
attendance
on
him
while
the
count
himself
was
to
drive
in
a
small
trap
straight
to
a
spot
reserved
for
him
.
they
were
taking
fiftyfour
hounds
with
six
hunt
attendants
and
whippersin
.
besides
the
family
there
were
eight
borzoi
kennelmen
and
more
than
forty
borzois
so
that
with
the
bor
zois
on
the
leash
belonging
to
members
of
the
family
there
were
about
a
hundred
and
thirty
dogs
and
twenty
horsemen
.
each
dog
knew
its
master
and
its
call
.
each
man
in
the
hunt
knew
his
business
his
place
and
what
he
had
to
do
.
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
the
fence
they
all
spread
out
evenly
and
quietly
without
noise
or
talk
along
the
road
and
field
leading
to
the
otrddnoe
covert
.
the
horses
stepped
over
the
field
as
over
a
thick
carpet
now
and
then
splashing
into
pud
dles
as
they
crossed
a
road
.
the
misty
sky
still
seemed
to
descend
evenly
and
imperceptibly
toward
the
earth
the
air
was
still
warm
and
silent
.
occasionally
the
whistle
of
a
huntsman
the
snort
of
a
horse
the
crack
of
a
whip
or
the
whine
of
a
straggling
hound
could
be
heard
.
when
they
had
gone
a
little
less
than
a
mile
five
more
riders
with
dogs
appeared
out
of
the
mist
approaching
the
rostovs
.
in
front
rode
a
freshlooking
handsome
old
man
with
a
large
gray
mustache
.
good

nicholas
when
the
old
man

near
.

uncle
.

was
a

of
small
means
and
their

.

asked
nicholas
.
the
hounds
were
joined
into
one
pack
and
uncle
and
nicholas
rode
on
side
by
side
.
na
tdsha
muffled
up
in
shawls
which
did
not
hide
her
eager
face
and
shining
eyes
galloped
up
to
them
.
she
was
followed
by
ptya
who
always
kept
close
to
her
by
michael
a
huntsman
and
by
a
groom
appointed
to
look
after
her
.
ptya
who
was
laughing
whipped
and
pulled
at
his
horse
.
natdsha
sat
easily
and
confidently
on
280
war
and
peace
her
black
ardbchik
and
reined
him
in
without
effort
with
a
firm
hand
.
uncle
looked
round
disapprovingly
at
pet
ya
and
natdsha
.
he
did
not
like
to
combine
frivolity
with
the
serious
business
of
hunting
.
good

shouted
ptya
.

iy
nicholas

natdsha
referring
to
her
favor
ite
hound
.
in
the
first
place
trunfla
is
not
a
dog
but
a
harrier
thought
nicholas
and
looked
stern
ly
at
his
sister
trying
to
make
her
feel
the
dis
tance
that
ought
to
separate
them
at
that
mo
ment
.
natdsha
understood
it
.
you

think
well

uncle
she
said
.

he
added
becausethats

the
oasis
of
the
otrddnoe
covert
came
in
sight
a
few
hundred
yards
off
the
huntsmen
were
already
nearing
it
.
rostov
having
finally
settled
with
uncle
where
they
should
set
on
the
hounds
and
having
shown
natasha
where
she
was
to
standa
spot
where
nothing
could
possibly
run
out
went
round
above
the
ravine
.
well
nephew
youre
going
for
a
big
wolf
said
uncle
.
mind
and
dont
let
her
slip
thats
as
may
happen
answered
rost6v
.
karay
here
he
shouted
answering
uncles
remark
by
this
call
to
his
borzoi
.
karay
was
a
shaggy
old
dog
with
a
hanging
jowl
famous
for
having
tackled
a
big
wolf
unaided
.
they
all
took
up
their
places
.
the
old
count
knowing
his
sons
ardor
in
the
hunt
hurried
so
as
not
to
be
late
and
the
hunstmen
had
not
yet
reached
their
places
when
count
ilyd
rostov
cheerful
flushed
and
with
quivering
cheeks
drove
up
with
his
black
horses
over
the
winter
rye
to
the
place
reserved
for
him
where
a
wolf
might
come
out
.
having
straightened
his
coat
and
fastened
on
his
hunt
ing
knives
and
horn
he
mounted
his
good
sleek
wellfed
and
comfortable
horse
viflyan
ka
which
was
turning
gray
like
himself
.
his
horses
and
trap
were
sent
home
.
count
ilyd
rost6v
though
not
at
heart
a
keen
sportsman
knew
the
rulesof
the
hunt
well
and
rode
to
the
bushy
edge
of
the
road
where
he
was
to
stand
arranged
his
reins
settled
himself
in
the
sad
dle
and
feeling
that
he
was
ready
looked
about
with
a
smile
.
beside
him
was
simon
chekmar
his
person
al
attendant
an
old
horseman
now
somewhat
stiff
in
the
saddle
.
chekmar
held
in
leash
three
formidable
wolfhounds
who
had
however
grown
fat
like
their
master
and
his
horse
.
two
wise
old
dogs
lay
down
unleashed
.
some
hun
dred
paces
farther
along
the
edge
of
the
wood
stood
mitka
the
counts
other
groom
a
daring
horseman
and
keen
rider
to
hounds
.
before
the
hunt
by
old
custom
the
count
had
drunk
a
silver
cupful
of
mulled
brandy
taken
a
snack
and
washed
it
down
with
half
a
bottle
of
his
favorite
bordeaux
.
he
was
somewhat
flushed
with
the
wine
and
the
drive
.
his
eyes
were
rather
moist
and
glit
tered
more
than
usual
and
as
he
sat
in
his
sad
dle
wrapped
up
in
his
fur
coat
he
looked
like
a
child
taken
out
for
an
outing
.
the
thin
hollowcheeked
chekmar
having
got
everything
ready
kept
glancing
at
his
mas
ter
with
whom
he
had
lived
on
the
best
of
terms
for
thirty
years
and
understanding
the
mood
he
was
in
expected
a
pleasant
chat
.
a
third
person
rode
up
circumspectly
through
the
wood
it
was
plain
that
he
had
had
a
lesson
and
stopped
behind
the
count
.
this
person
was
a
graybearded
old
man
in
a
womans
cloak
with
a
tall
peaked
cap
on
his
head
.
he

simon
did
not
finish
for
on
the
still
air
he
had
dis
tinctly
caught
the
music
of
the
hunt
with
only
two
or
three
hounds
giving
tongue
.
he
bent
down
his
head
and
listened
shaking
a
warn
ing
finger
at
his
master
.
they
are
on
the
scent
of

.

.

.
he
whispered
straight
to
the
lyadov
uplands
.
the
count
forgetting
to
smooth
out
the
smile
on
his
face
looked
into
the
distance
straight
before
him
down
the
narrow
open
space
holding
the
snuff
box
in
his
hand
but
not
taking
any
.
after
the
cry
of
the
hounds
came
the
deep
tones
of
the
wolf
call
from
daniels
hunting
horn
the
pack
joined
the
first
three
hounds
and
they
could
be
heard
in
full
cry
with
that
peculiar
lift
in
the
note
that
indicates
that
they
are
after
a
wolf
.
the
whippersin
no
longer
set
on
the
hounds
but
changed
to
the
cry
of
ulyulyu
and
above
the
others
rose
dan
iels
voice
now
a
deep
bass
now
piercingly
shrill
.
his
voice
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
wood
and
carried
far
beyond
out
into
the
open
field
.
after
listening
a
few
moments
in
silence
the
count
and
his
attendant
convinced
themselves
that
the
hounds
had
separated
into
two
packs
the
sound
of
the
larger
pack
eagerly
giving
tongue
began
to
die
away
in
the
distance
the
other
pack
rushed
by
the
wood
past
the
count
and
it
was
with
this
that
daniels
voice
was
heard
calling
ulyulyu
.
the
sounds
of
both
packs
mingled
and
broke
apart
again
but
both
were
becoming
more
distant
.
simon
sighed
and
stooped
to
straighten
the
leash
a
young
borzoi
had
entangled
the
count
too
sighed
and
noticing
the
snuffbox
in
his
hand
opened
it
and
took
a
pinch
.

cried
simon
to
a

that
was

the
count
and
simon
were
looking
at
him
.
then
unexpectedly
as
often
happens
the
sound
of
the
hunt
suddenly
approached
as
if
the
hounds
in
full
cry
and
daniel
ulyulyuing
were
just
in
front
of
them
.
the
count
turned
and
saw
on
his
right
mit
ka
staring
at
him
with
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
raising
his
cap
and
pointing
before
him
to
the
other
side
.
look
out
he
shouted
in
a
voice
plainly
showing
that
he
had
long
fretted
to
utter
that
word
and
letting
the
borzois
slip
he
galloped
toward
the
count
.
the
count
and
simon
galloped
out
of
the
wood
and
saw
on
their
left
a
wolf
which
softly
swaying
from
side
to
side
was
coming
at
a
quiet
lope
farther
to
the
left
to
the
very
place
where
they
were
standing
.
the
angry
borzois
whined
and
getting
free
of
the
leash
rushed
past
the
horses
feet
at
the
wolf
.
the
wolf
paused
turned
its
heavy
forehead
toward
the
dogs
awkwardly
like
a
man
suffer
ing
from
the
quinsy
and
still
slightly
swaying
from
side
to
side
gave
a
couple
of
leaps
and
with
a
swish
of
its
tail
disappeared
into
the
skirt
of
the
wood
.
at
the
same
instant
with
a
cry
like
a
wail
first
one
hound
then
another
and
then
another
sprang
helterskelter
from
the
wood
opposite
and
the
whole
pack
rushed
across
the
field
toward
the
very
spot
where
the
wolf
had
disappeared
.
the
hazel
bushes
parted
behind
the
hounds
and
daniels
chestnut
horse
appeared
dark
with
sweat
.
on
its
long
back
sat

hanging
over

round
by

while
the

was
coming
up
on
both
sides
all
trying
to
head
the
wolf

it
vanished
into
the
wood
before
they
could
do
so

meanwhile
remained
at
his
post
waiting
for
the

by
the
way
the

approached
and

cries

what

at

he
knew
that
young
and

wolves
were
there
that
the
hounds
had
separated
into
two
packs
that
somewhere
a
wolf
was
being
chased
and
that
something
had
gone
wrong
.
he
expected
the
wolf
to
come
his

any

.
he
made
thousands

as
to
where
and
from

the
beast
would
come
and
how
he
would

with

and

with

he

running

across
the

that

remained
in

for

the

over

.
the
wolf
seemed
to
say
to
herself
and
she
moved
forward
without
again
looking
round
and
with
a
quiet
long
easy
yet
resolute
lope
.

his

ed
headlong
downhill
leaping
over
gullies
to

off
the

and
the

passed
it

.
nicholas
did
not
hear
his
own
cry
nor
feel
that
he
was
galloping
nor
see
the
borzois
nor
the
groundover
which
he
went
he
saw
only
the
wolf
who
increasing
her
speed
bounded
on
in
the
same
direction
along
the
hollow
.
the
first
to
come
into
view
was

her

and

quarters
gaining
upon

and

.
now
she
was
ahead

the

its
head
to
face
her
and
instead
of
putting
on
speed
as
she
usually
did
mflka
suddenly
raised

shouted

round
for
the
old
borzoi
who
was
now
his
only
hope
.
karay
with
all
the
strength
age
had
left
him
stretched
himself
to
the

and
watch
ing
the

galloped
heavily
aside
to
intercept
it
.
but
the
quickness
of
the
wolfs
lope
and
the
borzois
slower
pace
made
it
plain
that
karay
had
miscalculated
.
nicholas
could
already
see
not
far
in
front
of
him
the
wood
where
the
wolf
book

would
certainly
escape
should
she
reach
it
.
but
coining
toward
him
he
saw
hounds
and
a
hunts
man
galloping
almost
straight
at
the
wolf
.
there
was
still
hope
.
a
long
yellowish
young
borzoi
one
nicholas
did
not
know
from
an
other
leash
rushed
impetuously
at
the
wolf
from
in
front
and
almost
knocked
her
over
.
but
the
wolf
jumped
up
more
quickly
than
anyone
could
have
expected
and
gnashing
her
teeth
flew
at
the
yellowish
borzoi
which
with
a
piercing
yelp
fell
with
its
head
on
the
ground
bleeding
from
a
gash
in
its
side

the

with
its
felted
hair
hanging
from
its

was
within
five
paces
of
it
.
as
if
aware
of
her
danger
the
wolf
turned
her
eyes
on
karay
tucked
her
tail
yet
further
between
her
legs
and
increased
her
speed
.
but
here
nicholas
only
saw
that
some
thing
happened
to

the
borzoi
was
sud
denly
on
the

and
they
rolled
together
down
into

thrust

nicholas

with

were
all
riding
round
the

crying

shouting
and
prepar

to

moment
that
the

crouched
back
and
starting
forward
again
ev

she
shook
herself
and
moved
toward
the
wood
where
she
would
be
safe
.
already
at
the
beginning
of
this
chase
daniel
hearing
theulyulyuing
had
rushed
out
from
the
wood
.
he
saw
karay
seize
the
wolf
and
checked
his
horse
supposing
the
affair
to
be
over
.
but
when
he
saw
that
the
horsemen
did
not
dismount
and
that
the
wolf
shook
her
self
and
ran
for
safety
daniel
set
his
chestnut
galloping
not
at
the
wolf
but
straight
toward
the
wood
just
as
karay
had
run
to
cut
the
ani
mal
off
.
as
a
result
of
this
he
galloped
up
to
the
wolf
just
when
she
had
been
stopped
a
sec
ond
time
by
uncles
borzois
.
daniel
galloped
up
silently
holding
a
naked
dagger
in
his
left
hand
and
thrashing
the
la
boring
sides
of
his
chestnut
horse
with
his
whip
as
if
it
were
a
flail
.
nicholas
neither
saw
nor
heard

un
til
the
chestnut
breathing
heavily
panted
past
him
and
he
heard
the
fall
of
a
body
and
saw
daniel
lying
on
the
wolfs
back
among
the
dogs
trying
to
seize
her
by
the
ears
.
it
was
evident
to
the
dogs
the
hunters
and
to
the
wolf
her
self
that
all
was
now
over
.
the
terrified
wolf
pressed
back
her
ears
and
tried
to
rise
but
the
borzois
stuck
to
her
.
daniel
rose
a
little
took
a
step
and
with
his
whole
weight
as
if
lying
down
to
rest
fell
on
the
wolf
seizing
her
by
the
ears
.
nicholas
was
about
to
stab
her
but
daniel
whispered
dont
well
gag
her
and
changing
his
position
set
his
foot
on
the
wolfs
neck
.
a
stick
was
thrust
between
her
jaws
and
she
was
fastened
with
a
leash
as
if
bridled
her
legs
were
bound
together
and
daniel
rolled
her
over
once
or
twice
from
side
to
side
.
with
happy
exhausted
faces
they
laid
the
old
wolf
alive
on
a
shying
and
snorting
horse
and
accompanied
by
the
dogs
yelping
at
her
took
her
to
the
place
where
they
were
all
to
meet
.
the
hounds
had
killed
two
of
the
cubs
and
the
borzois
three
.
the
huntsmen
assem
bled
with
their
booty
and
their
stories
and
all
came
to
look
at
the
wolf
which
with
her
broadbrowed
head
hanging
down
and
the
bit
ten
stick
between
her
jaws
gazed
with
great
glassy
eyes
at
this
crowd
of
dogs
and
men
sur
rounding
her
.
when
she
was
touched
she
jerked
her
bound
legs
and
looked
wildly
yet
simply
at
everybody
.
old

rode
up
and
touched
the

one
said
he
.

eh
he
asked
daniel
who
was
standing
near
.
yes

answered
daniel
quickly
doffing
his
cap
.
the

remembered
the
wolf
he
had
let
slip
and
his
encounter
with
daniel
.

but

chapter

the
old
count
went
home
and
natdsha
and
ptya
promised
to
return
very
soon
but
as
it
was
still
early
the
hunt
went
farther
.
at
mid
day
they
put
the
hounds
into
a
ravine
thickly
overgrown
with
young
trees
.
nicholas
standing
in
a
fallow
field
could
see
all
his
whips
.
facing
him
lay
a
field
of
winter
rye
and
there
his
own
huntsman
stood
alone
in
a
hollow
be
hind
a
hazel
bush
.
the
hounds
had
scarcely
been
loosed
before
nicholas
heard
one
he
knew
volt6rn
giving
tongue
at
intervals
oth
er
hounds
joined
in
now
pausing
and
now
a
gain
giving
tongue
.
a
moment
later
he
heard
a
cry
from
the
wooded
ravine
that
a
fox
had
been
found
and
the
whole
pack
joining
together
rushed
along
the
ravine
toward
theryefield
and
away
from
nicholas
.
he
saw
the
whips
in
their
red
caps
galloping
along
the
edge
of
the
ravine
he
even
saw
the
hounds
and
was
expecting
a
fox
to
show
itself
at
any
moment
on
the
ryefield
opposite
.
the
huntsman
standing
in
the
hollow
moved
and
loosed
his
borzois
and
nicholas
saw
a
queer
shortlegged
red
fox
with
a
fine
brush
going
hard
across
the
field
.
the
borzois
bore
down
on
it
.

..
.
now
they
drew
close
to
the
fox
which
began
to
dodge
between
the
field
in
sharper
and
sharper
curves
trailing
its
brush
when
suddenly
a
strange
white
borzoi
dashed
in
followed
by
a
black
one
and
everything
was
in
confusion
the
borzois
formed
a
starshaped
figure
scarcely
swaying
their
bodies
and
with
tails
turned
away
from
the
center
of
the
group
.
two
huntsmen
galloped
up
to
the
dogs
one
in
a
red
cap
the
other
a
stranger
in
a
green
coat
.
whats
this
thought
nicholas
.
wheres
that
huntsman
from
he
is
not
uncles
man
.
the
huntsmen
got
the
fox
but
stayed
there
a
long
time
without
strapping
it
to
the
saddle
.
their
horses
bridled
and
with
high
saddles
stood
near
them
and
there
too
the
dogs
were
lying
.
the
huntsmen
waved
their
arms
and
did
something
to
the
fox
.
then
from
that
spot
came
the
sound
of
a
horn
with
the
signal
agreed
on
in
case
of
a
fight
.
thats
ilagins
huntsman
havinga
row
with
our
ivdn
said
nicholas
groom
.
nicholas
sent
the
man
to
call
natasha
and
ptya
to
him
and
rode
at
a
footpace
to
the
place
where
the
whips
were
getting
the
hounds
together
.
several
of
the
field
galloped
to
the
spot
where
the
fight
was
going
on
.
nicholas
dismounted
and
with
natasha
and
petya
who
had
ridden
up
stopped
near
the
hounds
waiting
to
see
how
the
matter
would
end
.
out
of
the
bushes
came
the
huntsman
who
had
been
fighting
and
rode
toward
his
young
master
with
the
fox
tied
to
his
crupper
.
while
still
at
a
distance
he
took
off
his
cap
and
tried
to
speak
respectfully
but
he
was
pale
and
breathless
and
his
face
was
angry
.
one
of
his
eyes
was
black
but
he
probably
was
not
even
aware
of
it
.
what
has
happened
asked
nicholas
.
a
likely
thing
killing
a
fox
our
dogs
had
huntedl
and
it
was

that
caught

you
want
a
taste
of
this

.

.

.
said
the
huntsman
pointing
to
his
dagger
and
probably
imagining
himself
still
speaking
to
his
foe
.
nicholas
not
stopping
to
talk
to
the
man
asked
his
sister
and
petya
to
wait
for
him
and
rode
to
the
spot
where
the
enemys
ildgins
hunting
party
was
.
the
victorious
huntsman
rode
off
to
join
the
field
and
there
surrounded
by
inquiring
sym
pathizers
recounted
his
exploits
.
the
facts
were
that
ildgin
with
whom
the
rostovs
had
a
quarrel
and
were
at
law
hunted
over
places
that
belonged
bv
custom
to
the
ros
tovs
and
had
now
as
if
purposely
sent
his
men
to
the
very
woods
the
rost6vs
were
hunting
and
let
his
man
snatch
a
fox
their
dogs
had
chased
.
nicholas
though
he
had
never
seen
ildgin
with
his
usual
absence
of
moderation
in
judg
ment
hated
him
cordially
from
reports
of
his
arbitrariness
and
violence
and
regarded
him
as
his
bitterest
foe
.
he
rode
in
angry
agitation
toward
him
firmly
grasping
his
whip
and
ful
ly
prepared
to
take
the
most
resolute
and
des
perate
steps
to
punish
his
enemy
.
hardly
had
he
passed
an
angle
of
the
wood
before
a
stout
gentleman
in
a
beaver
cap
came
riding
toward
him
on
a
handsome
ravenblack
horse
accompanied
by
two
hunt
servants
.
instead
of
an
enemy
nicholas
found
in
ild
gin
a
stately
and
courteous
gentleman
who
was
particularly
anxious
to
make
the
young
counts
acquaintance
.
having
ridden
up
to
nicholas
ildgin
raised
his
beaver
cap
and
said
he
much
regretted
what
had
occurred
and
would
have
the
man
punished
who
had
allowed
himself
to
seize
a
fox
hunted
by
someone
elses
borzois
.
he
hoped
to
become
better
acquainted
with
the
count
and
invited
him
to
draw
his
covert

had
followed
him
in
some
excitement

seeing
the
enemies
exchanging
friendly
greetings
she
rode
up
to
them
.
ilagin
lifted
his
beaver
cap
still
higher
to
natasha
and
said
with
a
pleasant
smile
that
the
young
countess
resembled
diana
in
her
passion
for
the
chase
as
well
as
in
her
beauty
of
which
he
had
heard
much
.
to
expiate
his
huntsmans
offense
ilagin
pressed
the
rost6vs
to
come
to
an
upland
of
his
about
a
mile
away
which
he
usually
kept
for
himself
and
which
he
said
swarmed
with
hares
.
nicholas
agreed
and
the
hunt
now
doubled
moved
on
.
the
way
to
ilagins
upland
was
across
the
fields
.
the
hunt

fell
into

.
the

together

uncle
rost6v
and
ilagin
kept
stealthily
glancing
at
one
anothers
dogs
trying
not
to
be
observed
by
their
com
panions
and
searching
uneasily
for
rivals
to
their
own
borzois
.
rost6v
was
particularly
struck
by
the
beauty
of
a
small
purebred
redspotted
bitch
on
il
agins
leash
slender
but
with
muscles
like
steel
a
delicate
muzzle
and
prominent
black
eyes
.
he
had
heard
of
the
swiftness
of
ilagins
bor
zois
and
in
that
beautiful
bitch
saw
a
rival
to
his
own
milka
.
in
the
middle
of
a
sober
conversation
begun
by
ilagin
about
the
years
harvest
nicholas
pointed
to
the
redspotted
bitch
.
a
fine
little
bitch
that
said
he
in
a
care
less
tone
.
is
she
swift
that
one
yes
shes
a
good
dog
gets
what
shes
after
answered
ilagin
indifferently
of
the
redspotted
bitch
erza
for
which
a
year
before
he
had
given
a
neighbor
three
families
of
house
serfs
.
so
in
your
parts
too
the
har
vest
is
nothing
to
boast
of
count
he
went
on
continuing
the
conversation
they
had
be
gun
.
and
considering
it
polite
to
return
the
young
counts
compliment
ilagin
looked
at
his
borzois
and
picked
out
mflka
who
attract
ed
his
attention
by
her
breadth
.
that
black
spotted
one
of
yours
is
finewell
shaped
said
he
.
yes
shes
fast
enough
replied
nicholas
and
thought
if
only
a
fullgrown
hare
would
cross
the
field
now
id
show
you
what
sort
of
borzoi
she
is
m
and
turning
to
his
groom
he
said
he
would
give
a
ruble
to
anyone
who
found
a
hare
.
i
dont
understand
continued
ilagin
how
some
sportsmen
can
be
so
jealous
about
game
and
dogs
.
for
myself
i
can
tell
you
count
i
enjoy
riding
in
company
such
as
this

.

.

.
what
could
be
better
he
again
raised
his
cap
to
natasha
but
as
for
counting
skins
and
what
one
takes
i
dont
care
about
that
.
of
course
not
or
being
upset
because
someone
elses
bor
zoi
and
not
mine
catches
something
.
all
i
care
about
is
to
enjoy
seeing
the
chase
is
it
not
so
count
for
i
consider
that

.

.

.
atu
came
the
longdrawn
cry
of
one
of
the
borzoi
whippersin
who
had
halted
.
he
stood
on
a
knoll
in
the
stubble
holding
his
whip
aloft
and
again
repeated
his
longdrawn
cry
atu
this
call
and
the
uplifted
whip
meant
that
he
saw
a
sitting
hare
.
ah
he
has
found
one
i
think
said
ilagin
carelessly
.
well
let
us
course
it
count
.
yes
we
must
ride
up
.

.

.

.

we
both
course
it
answered
nicholas
seeing
in
erzd

uncles
red

two
rivals
he
had
nev
er
yet
had
a
chance
of
pitting
against
his
own
borzois
.
and
suppose
they
outdo
my
milka
at
once
he
thought
as
he
rode
with
uncle
and
ildgin
toward
the
hare
.
a
fullgrown
one
asked
ilagin
as
he
ap
proached
the
whip
who
had
sighted
the
hare
and
not
without
agitation
he
looked
round
and
whistled
to
erza
.
and

he
said
addressing
uncle
.
the
latter
was
riding
with
a
sullen
expres
sion
on
his
face

he
added
involuntarily
by
this
diminutive
expressing
his
affection
and
the
hopes
he
placed
on
this

.
natasha
saw
and
felt
the
agi
tation
the
two
elderly
men
and
her
brother
were
trying
to
conceal
and
was
herself
excited
by
it
.
the
huntsman
stood
halfway
up
the
knoll
holding
up
his
whip
and
the
gentlefolk
rode
up
to
him
at
a
footpace
the
hounds
that
were
far
off
on
the
horizon
turned
away
from
the
hare
and
the
whips
but
not
the
gentlefolk
al
so
moved
away
.
all
were
moving
slowly
and
sedately
.
how
is
it
pointing
asked
nicholas
rid
ing
a
hundred
paces
toward
the
whip
who
had
sighted
the
hare
.
but
before
the
whip
could
reply
the
hare
scenting
the
frost
coming
next
morning
was
unable
to
rest
and
leaped
up
.
the
pack
on
286
war
and
peace
leash
rushed
downhill
in
full
cry
after
the
hare
and
from
all
sides
the
borzois
that
were
not
on
leash
darted
after
the
hounds
and
the
hare
.
all
the
hunt
who
had
been
moving
slowly
shouted
stop
calling
in
the
hounds
while
the
borzoi
whips
with
a
cry
of
atu
galloped
across
the
field
setting
the
borzois
on
the
hare
.
the
tranquil
ildgin
nicholas
natdsha
and
uncle
flew
reckless
of
where
and
how
they
went
seeing
only
the
borzois
and
the
hare
and
fearing
only
to
lose
sight
even
for
an
instant
of
the
chase
.
the
hare
they
had
started
was
a
strong
and
swift
one
.
when
he
jumped
up
he
did
not
run
at
once
but
pricked
his
ears
listen
ing
to
the
shouting
and
trampling
that
resound
ed
from
all
sides
at
once
.
he
took
a
dozen
bounds
not
very
quickly
letting
the
borzois
gain
on
him
and
finally
having
chosen
his
di
rection
and
realized
his
danger
laid
back
his
ears
and
rushed
off
headlong
.
he
had
been
ly
ing
in
the
stubble
but
in
front
of
him
was
the
autumn
sowing
where
the
ground
was
soft
.
the
two
borzois
of
the
huntsman
who
had
sighted
him
having
been
the
nearest
were
the
first
to
see
and
pursue
him
but
they
had
not
gone
far
before

within

flew
at

with
terrible
swiftness
aiming
at
his
scut
and
think
ing
she
had
seized
him
rolled
over
like
a
ball
.
the
hare
arched
his
back
and
bounded
off
yet
more
swiftly
.
from
behind
erzd
rushed
the
broadhaunched

and
be

rapidly
gaining
on
the

and
flew

.
the

had
squatted
.
again
the
beautiful

reached
him
but
when
close
to
the

paused
as
if
measuring
the
distance
so
as
not
to
make

at
the

moment
when

and
darted
along

between
the

it
was
easier
for

to
run
on

and
the

did
not
overtake
him
so
quickly

muddying
his
back
he
rolled
over
with
the
hare
.
a
ring
of
borzois
surrounded
him
.
a
mo
ment
later
everyone
had
drawn
up
round
the
crowd
of
dogs
.
only
the
delighted
uncle
dis
mounted
and
cut
off
a
pad
shaking
the
hare
for
the
blood
to
drip
off
and
anxiously
glanc
ing
round
with
restless
eyes
while
his
arms
and
legs
twitched
.
he
spoke
without
himself
knowing
whom
to
or
what
about
.
thats
it
come
on
thats
a
dog

.

.

.
there
it
has
beat
en
them
all
the
thousandruble
as
well
as
the
oneruble
borzois
.
thats
it
come
on
said
he
panting
and
looking
wrathfully
around
as
if
he
were
abusing
someone
as
if
they
were
all
his
enemies
and
had
insulted
him
and
only
now
had
he
at
last
succeeded
in
justifying
him
self
.
there
are
your
thousandruble
ones
.

.

.

.
thats
it
come
on

.

.

.
rugay
heres
a
pad
for
you
i
he
said
throw
ing
down
the
hares
muddy
pad
.
youve
de
served
it
thats
it
come
on
shed
tired
herself
out
shed
run
it
down
three
times
by
herself
said
nicholas
also
not
listening
to
anyone
and
regardless
of
whether
he
were
heard
or
not
.
but
what
is
there
in
running
across
it
like
that
said
ilagins
groom
.
once
she
had
missed
it
and
turned
it
away
any
mongrel
could
take
it
iligin
was
saying
at
the
same
time
breathless
from
his
gallop
and
his
excitement
.
at
the
same
moment
nauisha
without
drawing
breath
screamed
joyously
ec
statically
and
so
piercingly
that
it
set
every
ones
ear
tingling
.
by
that
shriek
she
expressed
what
the
others
expressed
by
all
talkingat
once
and
it
was
so
strange
that
she
must
herself
have
been
ashamed
of
so
wild
a
cry
and
everyone
else
would
have
been
amazed
at
it
at
any
other
time
.
uncle
himself
twisted
up
the
hare
threw
it
neatly
and
smartly
across
his
horses
back
as
if
by
that
gesture
he
meant
to
rebuke
everybody
and
with
an
air
of
not
wishing
to
speak
to
any
one
mounted
his
bay
and
rode
off
.
the
others
all
followed
dispirited
and
shamefaced
and
only
much
later
were
they
able
to
regain
their
former
affectation
of
indifference
.
for
a
long
time
they
continued
to
look
at
red
rugay
who
his
arched
back
spattered
with
mud
and
clank
ing
the
ring
of
his
leash
walked
along
just
be
hind
uncles
horse
with
the
serene
air
of
a
conqueror
.
well
i
am
like
any
other
dog
as
long
as
its
book
seven
287
not
a
question
of
coursing
.
but
when
it
is
then
look
out
his
appearance
seem
to
nicholas
to
be
saying
.
when
much
later
uncle
rode
up
to
nich
olas
and
began
talking
to
him
he
felt
flattered
that
after
what
had
happened
uncle
deigned
to
speak
to
him
.
chapter
vii
toward
evening
ilagin
took
leave
of
nicholas
who
found
that
they
were
so
far
from
home
that
he
accepted
uncles
offer
that
the
hunt
ing
party
should
spend
the
night
in
his
little
village
of
mikhaylovna
.
and
if
you
put
up
at
my
house
that
will
be
better
still
thats
it
come
onl
said
uncle
.
you
see
its
damp
weather
and
you
could
rest
and
the
little
countess
could
be
driven
home
in
a
trap
.
uncles
offer
was
accepted
.
a
huntsman
was
sent
to
otradnoe
for
a
trap
while
nicho
las
rode
with
natdsha
and
ptya
to
uncles
house
.
some
five
male
domestic
serfs
big
and
little
rushed
out
to
the
front
porch
to
meet
their
master
.
a
score
of
women
serfs
old
and
young
as
well
as
children
popped
out
from
the
back
entrance
to
have
a
look
at
the
hunters
who
were
arriving
.
the
presenceof
natasha
a
worn
an
a
lady
and
on
horseback
raised
the
curi
osity
of
the
serfs
to
such
a
degree
that
many
of
them
came
up
to
her
stared
her
in
the
face
and
unabashed
by
her
presence
made
remarks
about
her
as
though
she
were
some
prodigy
on
show
and
not
a
human
being
able
to
hear
or
understand
what
was
said
about
her
.
arfnka
look
she
sits
sideways
there
she
sits
and
her
skirt
dangles
.

.

.

.
see
shes
got
a
little
hunting
horn
goodness
gracious
see
her
knife

.

.

.
isnt
she
a
tartar
how
is
it
you
didnt
go
head
over
heels
asked
the
boldest
of
all
addressing
natdsha
directly
.
uncle
dismounted
at
the
porch
of
his
lit
tle
wooden
house
which
stood
in
the
midst
of
an
overgrown
garden
and
after
a
glance
at
his
retainers
shouted
authoritatively
that
the
superfluous
ones
should
take
themselves
off
and
that
all
necessary
preparations
should
be
made
to
receive
the
guests
and
the
visitors
.
the
serfs
all
dispersed
.
uncle
lifted
na
tdsha
off
her
horse
and
taking
her
hand
led
her
up
the
rickety
wooden
steps
of
the
porch
.
the
house
with
its
bare
unplastered
log
walls
was
not
overclean
it
did
not
seem
that
those
liv
ing
in
it
aimed
at
keeping
it
spotless
but
nei
ther
was
it
noticeably
neglected
.
in
the
entry
there
was
a
smell
of
fresh
apples
and
wolf
and
fox
skins
hung
about
.
uncle
led
the
visitors
through
the
ante
room
into
a
small
hall
with
a
folding
table
and
red
chairs
then
into
the
drawing
room
with
a
round
birchwood
table
and
a
sofa
and
finally
into
his
private
room
where
there
was
a
tattered
sofa
a
worn
carpet
and
portraits
of
suv6rov
of
the
hosts
father
and
mother
and
of
himself
in
military
uniform
.
the
study
smelt
strongly
of
tobacco
and
dogs
.
uncle
asked
his
visitors
to
sit
down
and
make
themselves
at
home
and
then
went
out
of
the
room
.
rugay
his
back
still
muddy
came
into
the
room
and
lay
down
on
the
sofa
cleaning
himself
with
his
tongue
and
teeth
.
leading
from
the
study
was
a
passage
in
which
a
partition
with
ragged
curtains
could
be
seen
.
from
behind
this
came
womens
laugh
ter
and
whispers
.
natasha
nicholas
and
pehya
took
off
their
wraps
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
.
pc
tya
leaning
on
his
elbow
fell
asleep
at
once
.
natasha
and
nicholas
were
silent
.
their
faces
glowed
they
were
hungry
and
very
cheerful
.
they
looked
at
one
another
now
that
the
hunt
was
over
and
they
were
in
the
house
nicholas
no
longer
considered
it
necessary
to
show
his
manly
superiority
over
his
sister
na
tdsha
gave
him
a
wink
and
neither
refrained
long
from
bursting
into
a
peal
of
ringinglaugh
ter
even
before
they
had
a
pretext
ready
to
ac
count
for
it
.
after
a
while
uncle
came
in
in
a
cossack
coat
blue
trousers
and
small
top
boots
.
and
natasha
felt
that
this
costume
the
very
one
she
had
regarded
with
surprise
and
amusement
at
otrddnoe
was
just
the
right
thing
and
not
at
all
worse
than
a
swallowtail
or
frock
coat
.
uncle
too
was
in
high
spirits
and
far
from
being
offended
by
the
brothers
and
sisters
laughter
it
could
never
enter
his
head
that
they
might
be
laughing
at
his
way
of
life
he
himself
joined
in
the
merriment
.
thats
right
young
countess
thats
it
come
on
i
never
saw
anyone
like
her
said
he
offer
ing
nicholas
a
pipe
with
a
long
stem
and
with
a
practiced
motion
of
three
fingers
taking
down
another
that
had
been
cut
short
.
shes
ridden
all
day
like
a
man
and
is
as
fresh
as
ever
soon
after
uncles
reappearance
the
door
was
opened
evidently
from
the
sound
by
a
barefooted
girl
and
a
stout
rosy
goodlooking
woman
of
about
forty
with
a
double
chin
and
full
red
lips
entered
carrying
a
large
loaded
288
war
and
peace
tray
.
with
hospitable
dignity
and
cordiality
in
her
glance
and
in
every
motion
she
looked
at
the
visitors
and
with
a
pleasant
smile
bowed
respectfully
.
in
spite
of
her
exceptional
stout
ness
which
caused
her
to
protrude
her
chest
and
stomach
and
throw
back
her
head
this
woman
who
was
uncles
housekeeper
trod
very
lightly
.
she
went
to
the
table
set
down
the
tray
and
with
her
plump
white
hands
deft
ly
took
from
it
the
bottles
and
various
hors
doeuvres
and
dishes
and
arranged
them
on
the
table
.
when
she
had
finished
she
stepped
aside
and
stopped
at
the
door
with
a
smile
on
her
face
.
here
i
am
.
i
am
she
now
do
you
understand
uncle
her
expression
said
to
rost6v
.
how
could
one
help
understanding
not
only
nicholas
but
even
natasha
under
stood
the
meaning
of
his
puckered
brow
and
the
happy
complacent
smile
that
slightly
puck
ered
his
lips
when
anfsya
fedorovna
entered
.
on
the
tray
was
a
bottle
of
herb
wine
different
kinds
of
vodka
pickled
mushrooms
rye
cakes
made
with
buttermilk
honey
in
the
comb
still
mead
and
sparkling
mead
apples
nuts
raw
and
roasted
and
nutand
honey
sweets
.
after
wards
she
brought
a
freshly
roasted
chicken
ham
preserves
made
with
honey
and
preserves
made
with
sugar
.
all
this
was
the
fruit
of
anisya
fedorovnas
housekeeping
gathered
and
prepared
by
her
.
the
smell
and
taste
of
it
all
had
a
smack
of
anfsya
fedorovna
herself
a
savor
of
juiciness
cleanliness
whiteness
and
pleasant
smiles
.
take
this
little
ladycountess
she
kept
saying
as
she
offered
natdsha
first
one
thing
and
then
another
.
natdsha
ate
of
everything
and
thought
she
had
never
seen
or
eaten
such
buttermilk
cakes
such
aromatic
jam
such
honeyandnut
sweets
or
such
a
chicken
anywhere
.
anfsya
fedorovna
left
the
room
.
after
supper
over
their
cherry
brandy
ros
t6v
and
uncle
talked
of
past
and
future
hunts
of
rugdy
and
ildgins
dogs
while
na
tdsha
sat
upright
on
the
sofa
and
listened
with
sparkling
eyes
.
she
tried
several
times
to
wake
ptya
that
he
might
eat
something
but
he
only
muttered
incoherent
words
without
waking
up
.
natdsha
felt
so
lighthearted
and
happy
in
these
novel
surroundings
that
she
only
feared
the
trap
would
come
for
her
too
soon
.
after
a
casual
pause
such
as
often
occurs
when
re
ceiving
friends
for
the
first
time
in
ones
own
house
uncle
answering
a
thought
that
was
in
his
visitors
minds
said
this
you
see
is
how
i
am
finishing
my
days
.

.

.

.
death
will
come
.
thats
it
come
onl
noth
ing
will
remain
.
then
why
harm
anyone
uncles
face
was
very
significant
and
even
handsome
as
he
said
this
.
involuntarily
ros
tov
recalled
all
the
good
he
had
heard
about
him
from
his
father
and
the
neighbors
.
throughout
the
whole
province
uncle
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
honorable
and
disinterested
of
cranks
.
they
called
him
in
to
decide
family
disputes
chose
him
as
ex
ecutor
confided
secrets
to
him
elected
him
to
be
a
justice
and
to
other
posts
but
he
always
persistently
refused
public
appointments
pass
ing
the
autumn
and
spring
in
the
fields
on
his
bay
gelding
sitting
at
home
in
winter
and
ly
ing
in
his
overgrown
garden
in
summer
.
why
dont
you
enter
the
service
uncle
i
did
once
but
gave
it
up
.
i
am
not
fit
for
it
.
thats
it
come
on
i
cant
make
head
or
tail
of
it
.
thats
for
youi
havent
brains
enough
.
now
hunting
is
another
matter
thats
it
come
on
open
the
door
there
he
shouted
.
why
have
you
shut
it
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
led
to
the
huntsmens
room
as
they
called
the
room
for
the
hunt
servants
.
there
was
a
rapid
patter
of
bare
feet
and
an
unseen
hand
opened
the
door
into
the
hunts
mens
room
from
which
came
the
clear
sounds
of
a
balaldyka
on
which
someone
who
was
evi
dently
a
master
of
the
art
was
playing
.
natd
sha
had
been
listening
to
those
strains
forsome
time
and
now
went
out
into
the
passage
to
hear
better
.
thats
mftka
my
coachman
.

..
.
i
have
got
him
a
good
balaldyka
.
im
fond
of
it
said
uncle
.
it
was
the
custom
for
mftka
to
play
the
bala
ldyka
in
the
huntsmens
room
when
uncle
returned
from
the
chase
.
uncle
was
fond
of
such
music
.
how
good
really
very
good
said
nich
olas
with
some
unintentional
superciliousness
as
if
ashamed
to
confess
that
the
sounds
pleased
him
very
much
.
very
good
said
natdsha
reproachfully
noticing
her
brothers
tone
.
not
very
good
its
simply
delicious
just
as
uncles
pickled
mushrooms
honey
and
cherry
brandy
had
seemed
to
her
the
best
in
the
world
so
also
that
song
at
that
moment
seemed
to
her
the
acme
of
musical
delight
.
more
please
morel
cried
natdsha
at
the
door
as
soon
as
the
balaldyka
ceased
.
mftka
tuned
up
afresh
and
recommenced
thrum
ming
the
balaldyka
to
the
air
of
my
lady
with
book
seven
289
trills
and
variations
.
uncle
sat
listening
slightly
smiling
with
his
head
on
one
side
.
the
air
was
repeated
a
hundred
times
.
the
balalay
ka
was
retuned
several
times
and
the
same
notes
were
thrummed
again
but
the
listeners
did
not
grow
weary
of
it
and
wished
to
hear
it
again
and
again
.
anisya
fedorovna
came
in
and
leaned
her
portly
person
against
the
doorpost
.
you
like
listening
she
said
to
natasha
with
a
smile
extremely
like
uncles
.
thats
a
good
player
of
ours
she
added
.
he
doesnt
play
that
part
rightl
said
un
cle
suddenly
with
an
energetic
gesture
.
here
he
ought
to
burst
out
thats
it
come
on

ought
to
burst
out
.
do

play
then
asked
natasha
.
uncle
did
not
answer
but
smiled
.
anisya
go
and
see
if
the
strings
of
my
gui
tar
are
all
right
.
i
havent
touched
it
for
a
long
time
.
thats
it
come
on
ive
given
it
up
.
anfsya
fedorovna
with
her
light
step
will
ingly
went
to
fulfill
her
errand
and
brought
back
the
guitar
.
without
looking
at
anyone
uncle
blew
the
dust
off
it
and
tapping
the
case
with
his
bony
fingers
tuned
the
guitar
and
settled
him
self
in
his
armchair
.
he
took
he
guitar
a
little
above
the
fingerboard
arching
his
left
elbow
with
a
somewhat
theatrical
gesture
and
with
a
wink
at
anisya
fedorovna
struck
a
single
chord
pure
and
sonorous
and
then
quietly
smoothly
and
confidently
began
playing
in
very
slow
time
not
my
lady
but
the
well
known
song
came
a
maiden
down
the
street
.
the
tune
played
with
precisionand
in
exact
time
began
to
thrill
in
the
hearts
of
nicholas
and
natdsha
arousing
in
them
the
same
kind
of
sober
mirth
as
radiated
from
anisya
fedo
rovnas
whole
being
.
anisya
fedorovna
flushed
and
drawing
her
kerchief
over
her
face
went
laughing
out
of
the
room
.
uncle
continued
to
play
correctly
carefully
with
energetic
firm
ness
looking
with
a
changed
and
inspired
ex
pression
at
the
spot
where
anfsya
fedorovna
had
just
stood
.
something
seemed
to
be
laugh
ing
a
little
on
one
side
of
his
face
under
his
gray
mustaches
especially
as
the
song
grew
brisker
and
the
time
quicker
and
when
here
and
there
as
he
rah
his
fingers
over
the
strings
something
seemed
to
snap
.
lovely
lovely
i
go
on
uncle
go
on
shouted
natasha
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
.
she
jumped
up
and
hugged
and

she
said
turning
to
her
brother
as
if
asking
him
what
is
it
moves
me
so
nicholas
too
was
greatly
pleased
by
un
cles
playing
and
uncle
played
the
piece
over
again
.

fetching

dear

played
uncle
once
more
running
his
fingers
skillfully
over
the
strings
and
then
he
stopped
short
and
jerked
his
shoulders
.
go
on
uncle
dear
nauisha
wailed
in
an
imploring
tone
as
if
her
life
depended
on
it
.
uncle
rose
and
it
was
as
if
there
were
two
men
in
him
one
of
them
smiled
seriously
at
the
merry
fellow
while
the
merry
fellow
struck
a
naive
and
precise
attitude
preparatory
to
a
folk
dance
.
now
then
niece
he
exclaimed
waving
to
natasha
the
hand
that
had
just
struck
a
chord
.
natasha
threw
off
the
shawl
from
her
shoul
ders
ran
forward
to
face
uncle
and
setting
her
arms
akimbo
also
made
a
motion
with
her
shoulders
and
struck
an
attitude
.
where
how
and
when
had
this
young
count
ess
educated
by
an
emigree
french
governess
imbibed
from
the
russian
air
she
breathed
that
spirit
and
obtained
that
manner
which
the
pas
de
chdle

would
one
would
have
sup
posed
long
ago
have
effaced
but
the
spirit
and
the
movements
were
those
inimitable
and
un
teachable
russian
ones
that
uncle
had
expected
of
her
.
as
soon
as
she
had
struck
her
pose
and
smiled
triumphantly
proudly
and
with
sly
merriment
the
fear
that
had
at
first
seized
nicholas
and
the
others
that
she
might
not
do
the
right
thing
was
at
an
end
and
they
were
already
admiring
her
.
she
did
the
right
thing
with
such
precision
such
complete
precision
that
anisya
fedorov
na
who
had
at
once
handed
her
the
handker
chief
she
needed
for
the
dance
had
tears
in
her
eyes
though
she
laughed
as
she
watched
this
slim
graceful
countess
reared
in
silks
and
velvets
and
so
different
from
herself
who
yet
was
able
to
understand
all
that
was
in
anfsya
and
in
anfsyas
father
and
mother
and
aunt
and
in
every
russian
man
and
woman
.
well
little
countess
thats
it
come
on
cried
uncle
with
a
joyous
laugh
having
finished
the
dance
.
well
done
niece
now
a
fine
young
fellow
must
be
found
as
husband
for
you
.
thats
it
come

war
and
peace
oh
said
uncle
in
surprise
looking
in
quiringly
at
natdsha
who
nodded
her
head
with
a
happy
smile
.
and
such
a
one
she
said
.
but
as
soon
as
she
had
said
it
a
new
train
of
thoughts
and
feelings
arose
in
her
.
what
did
nicholas
smile
mean
when
he
said
chosen
already
is
he
glad
of
it
or
not
it
is
as
if
he
thought
my
bolk6nski
would
not
approve
of
or
understand
our
gaiety
.
but
he
would
understand
it
all
.
where
is
he
now
she
thought
and
her
face
suddenly
be
came
serious
.
but
this
lasted
only
a
second
.
dont
dare
to
think
about
it
she
said
to
her
self
and
sat
down
again
smilingly
beside
un
cle
begging
him
to
play
something
more
.
uncle
played
another
song
and
a
valse
then
after
a
pause
he
cleared
his
throat
and
sang
his
favorite
hunting
song
as
twas
growing
dark
last
night
fell
the
snow
so
soft
and
light

.

.
uncle
sang
as
peasants
sing
with
full
and
naive
conviction
that
the
whole
meaning
of
a
song
lies
in
the
words
and
that
the
tune
comes
of
itself
and
that
apart
from
the
words
there
is
no
tune
which
exists
only
to
give
measure
to
the
words
.
as
a
result
of
this
the
unconsid
ered
tune
like
the
song
of
a
bird
was
extra
ordinarily
good
.
natasha
was
in
ecstasies
over
uncles
singing
.
she
resolved
to
give
up
learning
the
harp
and
to
play
only
the
guitar
.
she
asked
uncle
for
his
guitar
and
at
once
found
the
chords
of
the
song
.
after
nine
oclock
two
traps
and
three
mounted
men
who
had
been
sent
to
look
for
them
arrived
to
fetch
natdsha
and
pdtya
.
the
count
and
countess
did
not
know
where
they
were
and
were
very
anxious
said
one
of
the
men
.
ptya
was
carried
out
like
a
log
and
laid
in
the
larger
of
the
two
traps
.
natasha
and
nich
olas
got
into
the
other
.
uncle
wrapped
na
tdsha
up
warmly
and
took
leave
of
her
with
quite
a
new
tenderness
.
he
accompanied
them
on
foot
as
far
as
the
bridge
that
could
not
be
crossed
so
that
they
had
to
go
round
by
the
ford
and
he
sent
huntsmen
to
ride
in
front
with
lanterns
.
goodby
dear
niece
his
voice
called
out
of
the
darkness
not
the
voice
natdsha
had
known
previously
but
the
one
that
had
sung
as
twas
growing
dark
last
night
.
in
the
village
through
which
they
passed
there
were
red
lights
and
a
cheerful
smell
of
smoke
.
what
a
darling
uncle
is
said
natdsha
when
they
had
come
out
onto
the
highroad
.
yes
returned
nicholas
.
youre
not
cold
no
.
im
quite
quite
all
right
.
i
feel
so
com
fortable
answered
natdsha
almost
perplexed
by
her
feelings
.
they
remained
silent
a
long
while
.
the
night
was
dark
and
damp
.
they
could
not
see
the
horses
but
only
heard
them
splashing
through
the
unseen
mud
.
what
was
passing
in
that
receptive
childlike
soul
that
so
eagerly
caught
and
assimilated
all
the
diverse
impressions
of
life
how
did
they
all
find
place
in
her
but
she
was
very
happy
.
as
they
were
near
ing
home
she
suddenly
struck
up
the
air
of
as
twas
growing
dark
last
night
the
tune
of
which
she
had
all
the
way
been
try
ing
to
get
and
had
at
last
caught
.
got
it
said
nicholas
.
what
were
you
thinking
about
just
now
nicholas
inquired
natdsha
.
they
were
fond
of
asking
one
another
that
question
.
i
said
nicholas
trying
to
remember
.
well
you
see
first
i
thought
that
rugdy
the
red
hound
was
like
uncle
and
that
if
he
were
a
man
he
would
always
keep
uncle
near
him
if
not
for
his
riding
then
for
his
manner
.
what
a
good
fellow
uncle
is
dont
you
think
so

..
.
well
and
you
i
wait
a
bit
wait
yes
first
i
thought
that
we
are
driving
along
and
imagining
that
we
are
going
home
but
that
heaven
knows
where
we
are
really
going
in
the
darkness
and
that
we
shall
arrive
and
suddenly
find
that
we
are
not
in
otrddnoe
but
in
fairyland
.
and
then
i
thought

.

.

.
no
nothing
else
.
i
know
i
expect
you
thought
of
him
said
nicholas
smiling
as
natdsha
knew
by
the
sound
of
his
voice
.
no
said
natdsha
though
she
had
in
reali
ty
been
thinking
about
prince
andrew
at
the
same
time
as
of
the
rest
and
of
how
he
would
have
liked
uncle
.
and
then
i
was
saying
to
myself
all
the
way
how
well
anfsya
carried
herself
how
well

and
nicholas
heard
her
spontaneous
happy
ringing
laughter
.
and
do
you
know
she
suddenly
said
i
know
that
i
shall
never
again
be
as
happy
and
tranquil
as
i
am
now
.
rubbish
nonsense
humbug
exclaimed
nicholas
and
he
thought
how
charming
this
natdsha
of
mine
is
i
have
no
other
friend
like
her
and
never
shall
have
.
why
should
she
marry
we
might
always
drive
about
together
what
a
darling
this
nicholas
of
mine
is
thought
natdsha
.
ah
there
are
still
lights
in
the
drawing
book
seven
291
room
she
said
pointing
to
the
windows
of
the
house
that
gleamed
invitingly
in
the
moist
velvety
darkness
of
the
night
.
chapter
viii
count
ilya
rosi6v
had
resigned
the
position
of
marshal
of
the
nobility
because
it
involved
him
in
too
much
expense
but
still
his
affairs
did
not
improve
.
natasha
and
nicholas
often
noticed
their
parents
conferring
together
anx
iously
and
privately
and
heard
suggestions
of
selling
the
fine
ancestral
rost6v
house
and
es
tate
near
moscow
.
it
was
not
necessary
to
en
tertain
so
freely
as
when
the
count
had
been
marshal
and
life
atotrddnoe
was
quieter
than
in
former
years
but
still
the
enormous
house
and
its
lodges
were
full
of
people
and
more
than
twenty
sat
down
to
table
every
day
.
these
were
all
their
own
people
who
had
settled
down
in
the
house
almost
as
members
of
the
family
or
persons
who
were
it
seemed
obliged
to
live
in
the
counts
house
.
such
were
dimm
ler
the
musician
and
his
wife
vogel
the
dancing
master
and
his
family
bel6va
an
old
maiden
lady
an
inmate
of
the
house
and
many
others
such
as
pkyas
tutors
the
girls
former
governess
and
other
people
who
simply
found
it
preferable
and
more
advantageous
to
live
in
the
counts
house
than
at
home
.
they
had
not
as
many
visitors
as
before
but
the
old
habits
of
life
without
which
the
count
and
countess
could
not
conceive
of
existence
remained
unchanged
.
there
was
still
the
hunting
establishment
which
nicholas
had
even
enlarged
the
same
fifty
horses
and
fifteen
grooms
in
the
stables
the
same
expensive
presents
and
dinner
parr
ties
to
the
whole
district
on
name
days
there
were
still
the
counts
games
of
whist
and
bos
ton
at
whichspreading
out
his
cards
so
that
everybody
could
see
them
he
let
himself
be
plundered
of
hundreds
of
rubles
every
day
by
his
neighbors
who
looked
upon
an
opportu
nity
to
play
a
rubber
with
count
rost6v
as
a
most
profitable
source
of
income
.
the
count
moved
in
his
affairs
as
in
a
huge
net
trying
not
to
believe
that
he
was
entangled
but
becoming
more
and
more
so
at
every
step
and
feeling
too
feeble
to
break
the
meshes
or
to
set
to
work
carefully
and
patiently
to
disen
tangle
them
.
the
countess
with
her
loving
heart
felt
that
her
children
were
being
ruined
that
it
was
not
the
counts
fault
for
he
could
not
help
being
what
he
was
that
though
he
tried
to
hide
it
he
himself
suffered
from
the
consciousness
of
his
own
and
his
childrens
ruin
and
she
tried
to
find
means
of
remedying
the
position
.
from
her
feminine
point
of
view
she
could
see
only
one
solution
namely
for
nicholas
to
marry
a
rich
heiress
.
she
felt
this
to
be
their
last
hope
and
that
if
nicholas
refused
the
match
she
had
found
for
him
she
would
have
to
abandon
the
hope
of
ever
getting
mat
ters
right
.
this
match
was
with
julie
karagina
the
daughter
of
excellent
and
virtuous
parents
a
girl
the
rost6vs
had
known
from
childhood
and
who
had
now
become
a
wealthy
heiress
through
the
death
of
the
last
of
her
brothers
.
the
countess
had
written
direct
to
julies
mother
in
moscow
suggesting
a
marriage
be
tween
their
children
and
had
received
a
favor
able
answer
from
her
.
karagina
had
replied
that
for
her
part
she
was
agreeable
and
every
thing
would
depend
on
her
daughters
incli
nation
.
she
invited
nicholas
to
come
to
mos
cow
.
several
times
the
countess
with
tears
in
her
eyes
told
her
son
that
now
both
her
daughters
were
settled
her
only
wish
was
to
see
him
mar
ried
.
she
said
she
could
lie
down
in
her
grave
peacefully
if
that
were
accomplished
.
then
she
told
him
that
she
knew
of
a
splendid
girl
and
tried
to
discover
what
he
thought
about
marriage
.
at
other
times
she
praised
julie
to
him
and
advised
him
to
go
to
moscow
during
the
holi
days
to
amuse
himself
.
nicholas
guessed
what
his
mothers
remarks
were
leading
to
and
dur
ing
one
of
these
conversations
induced
her
to
speak
quite
frankly
.
she
told
him
that
her
only
hope
of
getting
their
affairs
disentangled
now
lay
in
his
marrying
julie
karagina
.
but
mamma
suppose
i
loved
a
girl
who
has
no
fortune
would
you
expect
me
to
sacri
fice
my
feelings
and
my
honor
for
the
sake
of
money
he
asked
his
mother
not
realizing
the
cruelty
of
his
question
and
only
wishing
to
show
his
noblemindedness
.
no
you
have
not
understood
me
said
his
mother
not
knowing
how
to
justify
herself
.
you
have
not
understood
me
nikolenka
.
it
is
your
happiness
i
wish
for
she
added
feel
ing
that
she
was
telling
an
untruth
and
was
becoming
entangled
.
she
began
to
cry
.
mamma
dont
cry
only
tell
me
that
you
wish
it
and
you
know
i
will
give
my
life
any
thing
to
put
you
at
ease
said
nicholas
.
i
would
sacrifice
any
thing
for
you
even
my
feel
ings
.
but
the
countess
did
not
want
the
question
put
like
that
she
did
not
want
a
sacrifice
from
her
son
she
herself
wished
to
make
a
sacrifice
for
him
.
2q2
war
and
peace
no
you
have
not
understood
me
dont
let
us
talk
about
it
she
replied
wiping
away
her
tears
.
maybe
i
do
love
a
poor
girl
said
nicholas
to
himself
.
am
i
to
sacrifice
my
feelings
and
my
honor
for
money
i
wonder
how
mamma
could
speak
so
to
me
.
because
s6nya
is
poor
i
must
not
love
her
he
thought
must
not
re
spond
to
her
faithful
devoted
love
yet
i
should
certainly
be
happier
with
her
than
with
some
dolllike
julie
.
i
can
always
sacrifice
my
feelings
for
my
familys
welfare
he
said
to
himself
but
i
cant
coerce
my
feelings
.
if
i
love
sonya
that
feeling
is
for
me
stronger
and
higher
than
all
else
.
nicholas
did
not
go
to
moscow
and
the
countess
did
not
renew
the
conversation
with
him
about
marriage
.
she
saw
with
sorrow
and
sometimes
with
exasperation
symptoms
of
a
growing
attachment
between
her
son
and
the
portionless
sonya
.
though
she
blamed
herself
for
it
she
could
not
refrain
from
grumbling
at
and
worrying
sonya
often
pulling
herup
with
out
reason
addressing
her
stiffly
as
my
dear
and
using
the
formal
you
instead
of
the
inti
mate
thou
in
speaking
to
her
.
the
kind
hearted
countess
was
the
more
vexed
with
son
ya
because
that
poor
darkeyed
niece
of
hers
was
so
meek
so
kind
so
devotedly
grateful
to
her
benefactors
and
so
faithfully
unchanging
ly
and
unselfishly
in
love
with
nicholas
that
there
were
no
grounds
for
finding
fault
with
her
.
nicholas
was
spending
the
last
of
his
leave
at
home
.
a
fourth
letter
had
come
from
prince
andrew
from
rome
in
which
he
wrote
that
he
would
have
been
on
his
way
back
to
russia
long
ago
had
not
his
wound
unexpectedly
re
opened
in
the
warm
climate
which
obliged
him
to
defer
his
return
till
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
.
natdsha
was
still
as
much
in
love
with
her
betrothed
found
the
same
comfort
in
that
love
and
was
still
as
ready
to
throw
her
self
into
all
the
pleasures
of
life
as
before
but
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
month
of
their
separa
tion
she
began
to
have
fits
of
depression
which
she
could
not
master
.
she
felt
sorry
for
herself
sorry
that
she
was
being
wasted
all
this
time
and
of
no
use
to
anyonewhile
she
felt
herself
so
capable
of
loving
and
being
loved
.
things
were
not
cheerful
in
the

ix
christmas
came
and
except
for
the
ceremonial
mass
the
solemn
and
wearisome
christmas
congratulations
from
neighbors
and
servants
and
the
new
dresses
everyone
put
on
there
were
no
special
festivities
though
the
calm
frost
of
twenty
degrees
reaumur
1
the
dazzling
sunshine
by
day
and
the
starlight
of
the
win
ter
nights
seemed
to
call
for
some
special
cele
bration
of
the
season
.
on
the
third
day
of
christmas
week
after
the
midday
dinner
all
the
inmates
of
the
house
dispersed
to
various
rooms
.
it
was
the
dullest
time
of
the
day
.
nicholas
who
had
been
visit
ing
some
neighbors
that
morning
was
asleep
on
the
sittingroom
sofa
.
the
old
count
was
resting
in
his
study
.
sonya
sat
in
the
drawing
room
at
the
round
table
copying
a
design
for
embroidery
.
the
countess
was
play
ing
patience
.
nastasya
ivanovna
the
buffoon
sat
with
a
sad
face
at
the
window
with
two
old
ladies
.
nata
sha
came
into
the
room
went
up
to
s6nya
glanced
at
what
she
was
doing
and
then
went
up
to
her
mother
and
stood
without
speaking
.
why
are
you
wandering
about
like
an
out
cast
asked
her
mother
.

.

.

minute

said
natasha
with
glittering
eyes
and
no
sign
of
a
smile
.
the
countess
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
tentively
at
her
daughter
.

the
count
ess
.

be

like

mamma
her
voice
broke
tears
gushed
from
her
eyes
and
she
turned
quickly
to
hide
them
and
left
the
room
.
she
passed
into
the
sitting
room
stood
there
thinking
awhile
and
then
went
into
the
maids
room
.
there
an
old
maidservant
was
grum
bling
at
a
young
girl
who
stood
panting
hav
ing
just
run
in
through
the
cold
from
the
serfs
quarters
.

having
released
mavrushka
natasha
crossed
the
dancing
hall
and
went
to
the
vestibule
.
there
an
old
footman
and
two
young
ones
were
playing
cards
.
they
broke
off
and
rose
as
she
entered
.
what

cheerfully
and
readily
.

quickly
the
old
man
urged
him
.
and

a
piece
of
chalk
.
on
her
way
past
the
butlers
pantry
she
told
them
to
set
a
samovar
though
it
was
not
at
all
the
time
for
tea
.
f6ka
the
butler
was
the
most
illtempered
person
in
the
house
.
natasha
liked
to
test
her
power
over
him
.
he
distrusted
the
order
and
asked
whether
the
samovar
was
really
wanted
.
oh
dear
what
a
young
lady
said
f6ka
pretending
to
frown
at
natdsha
.
no
one
in
the
house
sent
people
about
or
gave
them
as
much
trouble
as
natdsha
did
.
she
could
not
see
people
unconcernedly
but
had
to
send
them
on
some
errand
.
she
seemed
to
be
trying
whether
any
of
them
would
get
angry
or
sulky
with
her
but
the
serfs
fulfilled
no
ones
orders
so
readily
as
they
did
hers
.
what
can
i
do
where
can
i
go
thought
she
as
she
went
slowly
along
the
passage
.
nastdsya
ivdnovna
what
sort
of
children
shall
i
have
she
asked
the
buffoon
who
was
coming
toward
her
in
a
womans
jacket
.
why
fleas
crickets
grasshoppers
an
swered
the
buffoon
.
o
lord
o

the
same
oh
where
am
i
to
go
what
am
i
to
do
with
my
self
and
tapping
with
her
heels
she
ran
quickly
upstairs
to
see
vogel
and
his
wife
who
lived
on
the
upper
story
.
two
governesses
were
sitting
with
the
vogels
at
a
table
on
which
were
plates
of
raisins
wal
nuts
and
almonds
.
the
governesses
were
dis
cussing
whether
it
was
cheaper
to
live
in
mos
cow
or
odessa
.
natdsha
sat
down
listened
to
their
talk
with
a
serious
and
thoughtful
air
and
then
got
up
again
.
the
island
of
madagascar
she
said
ma
dagascar
she
repeated
articulating
each
syl
lable
distinctly
and
not
replying
to
madame
schoss
who
asked
her
what
she
was
saying
she
went
out
of
the
room
.
her
brother
ptya
was
upstairs
too
with
the
man
in
attendance
on
him
he
was
preparing
fireworks
to
let
off
that
night
.
ptya
ptya
she
called
to
him
.

ptya
ran
up
and
offered
her
his
back
.
she
jumped
on
it
putting
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
he
pranced
along
with
her
.

the
island
of
madagascar
she
said
and
jumping
off
his
back
she
went
downstairs
.
having
as
it
were
reviewed
her
kingdom
tested
her
power
and
made
sure
that
everyone
was
submissive
but
that
all
the
same
it
was
dull
natdsha
betook
herself
to
the
ballroom
picked
up
her
guitar
sat
down
in
a
dark
corner
behind
a
bookcase
and
began
to
run
her
fin
gers
over
the
strings
in
the
bass
picking
out
a
passage
she
recalled
from
an
opera
she
had
heard
in
petersburg
with
prince
andrew
.
what
she
drew
from
the
guitar
would
have
had
no
meaning
for
other
listeners
but
in
her
imagi
nation
a
whole
series
of
reminiscences
arose
from
those
sounds
.
she
sat
behind
the
book
case
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
streak
of
light
es
caping
from
the
pantry
door
and
listened
to
herself
and
pondered
.
she
was
in
a
mood
for
brooding
on
the
past
.
sonya
passed
to
the
pantry
with
a
glass
in
her
hand
.
natdsha
glanced
at
her
and
at
the
crack
in
the
pantry
door
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
remembered
the
light
falling
through
that
crack
once
before
and
sonya
passing
with
a
glass
in
her
hand
.
yes
it
was
exactly
the
same
thought
natasha
.
s6nya
what
is
this
she
cried
twanging
a
thick
string
.
oh
you
are
there
said
s6nya
with
a
start
and
came
near
and
listened
.
i
dont
know
.
a
storm
she
ventured
timidly
afraid
of
being
wrong
.
there
thats
just
how
she
started
and
just
how
she
came
up
smiling
timidly
when
all
this
happened
before
thought
natdsha
and
in
just
the
same
way
i
thought
there
was
some
thing
lacking
in
her
.
no
its
the
chorus
from
the
watercarrier
listen
and
natdsha
sang
the
air
of
the
chorus
so
that
sonya
should
catch
it
.
where
were
you
going
she
asked
.
to
change
the
water
in
this
glass
.
i
am
just
finishing
the
design
.
you
always
find
something
to
do
but
i
cant
said
natdsha
.
and
wheres
nicholas
asleep
i
think
.
s6nya
go
and
wake
him
said
natdsha
.
tell
him
i
want
him
to
come
and
sing
.
she
sat
awhile
wondering
what
the
mean
ing
of
it
all
having
happened
before
could
be
and
without
solving
this
problem
or
at
all
re
gretting
not
having
done
so
she
again
passed
294
in
fancy
to
the
time
when
she
was
with
him
and
he
was
looking
at
her
with
a
lovers
eyes
.
oh
if
only
he
would
come
quicker
i
am
so
afraid
it
will
never
be
and
worst
of
all
i
am
growing
oldthats
the
thing
there
wont
then
be
in
me
what
there
is
now
.
but
perhaps
hell
come
today
will
come
immediately
.
per
haps
he
has
come
and
is
sitting
in
the
drawing
room
.
perhaps
he
came
yesterday
and
i
have
forgotten
it
.
she
rose
put
down
the
guitar
and
went
to
the
drawing
room
.
all
the
domestic
circle
tutors
governesses
and
guests
were
already
at
the
tea
table
.
the
servants
stood
round
the
tablebut
prince
an
drew
was
not
there
and
life
was
going
on
as
be
fore
.
ah
here
she
is
said
the
old
count
when
he
saw
natasha
enter
.
well
sit
down
by
me
.
but
natasha
stayed
by
her
mother
and
glanced
round
as
if
looking
for
something
.
mamma
she
muttered
give
him
to
me
give
him
mamma
quickly
quickly
and
she
again
had
difficulty
in
repressing
her
sobs
.
she
sat
down
at
the
table
and
listened
to
the
conversation
between
the
elders
and
nicholas
who
had
also
come
to
the
table
.
my
god
my
god
the
same
faces
the
same
talk
papa
hold
ing
his
cup
and
blowing
in
the
same
way
thought
natasha
feeling
with
horror
a
sense
of
repulsion
rising
up
in
her
for
the
whole
household
because
they
were
always
the
same
.
after
tea
nicholas
sonya
and
natdshawent
to
the
sitting
room
to
their
favorite
corner
where
their
most
intimate
talks
always
began
.
chapter
x
does
it
ever
happen
to
you
said
natdsha
to
her
brother
when
they
settled
down
in
the
sit
ting
room
does
it
ever
happen
to
you
to
feel
as
if
there
were
nothing
more
to
come
noth
ing
that
everything
good
is
past
and
to
feel
not
exactly
dull
but
sad
i
should
think
so
he
replied
.
i
have
felt
like
that
when
everything
was
all
right
and
everyone
was
cheerful
.
the
thought
has
come
into
my
mind
that
i
was
already
tired
of
it
all
and
that
we
must
all
die
.
once
in
the
regiment
i
had
not
gone
to
some
merrymaking
where
there
was
music

.

.

.
and
suddenly
1
felt
so
de
pressed

..
.
oh
yes
i
know
i
know
i
know
natdsha
interrupted
him
.
when
i
was
quite
little
that
used
to
be
so
with
me
.
do
you
remember
when
i
was
punished
once
about
some
plums
you
were
all
dancing
and
i
sat
sobbing
in
the
schoolroom
i
shall
never
forget
it
i
felt
sad
war
and
peace
and
sorry
for
everyone
for
myself
and
for
everyone
.
and
i
was
innocent
that
was
the
chief
thing
said
natdsha
.
do
you
remem
ber
i
remember
answered
nicholas
.
i
re
member
that
i
came
to
you
afterwards
and
wanted
to
comfort
you
but
do
you
know
i
felt
ashamed
to
.
we
were
terribly
absurd
.
i
had
a
funny
doll
then
and
wanted
to
give
it
to
you
.
do
you
remember
and
do
you
remember
natasha
asked
with
a
pensive
smile
how
once
long
long
ago
when
we
were
quite
little
uncle
called
us
into
the
study
that
was
in
the
old
house
and
it
was
dark
we
went
in
and
suddenly
there
stood

.

.

.
a
negro
chimed
in
nicholas
with
a
smile
of
delight
.
of
course
i
remember
.
even
now
i
dont
know
whether
there
really
was
a
negro
or
if
we
only
dreamed
it
or
were
told
about
him
.
he
was
gray
you
remember
and
had
white
teeth
and
stood
and
looked
at
us
.

.

.

.
sonya
do
you
remember
asked
nicholas
.
yes
yes
i
do
remember
something
too
s6nya
answered
timidly
.
you
know
i
have
asked
papa
and
mamma
about
that
negro
said
natasha
and
they
say
there
was
no
negro
at
all
.
but
you
see
you
re
member
of
course
i
do
i
remember
his
teeth
as
if
i
had
just
seen
them
.
how
strange
it
is
its
as
if
it
were
a
dream
i
like
that
.
and
do
you
remember
how
we
rolled
hard
boiled
eggs
in
the
ballroom
and
suddenly
two
old
women
began
spinning
round
on
the
car
pet
was
that
real
or
not
do
you
remember
what
fun
it
was
yes
and
you
remember
how
papa
in
his
blue
overcoat
fired
a
gun
in
the
porch
so
they
went
through
their
memories
smil
ing
with
pleasure
not
the
sad
memories
of
old
age
but
poetic
youthful
ones
those
impres
sions
of
ones
most
distant
past
in
which
dreams
and
realities
blend
and
they
laughed
with
quiet
enjoyment
.
s6nya
as
always
did
not
quite
keep
pace
with
them
though
they
shared
the
same
remi
niscences
.
much
that
they
remembered
had
slipped
from
her
mind
and
what
she
recalled
did
not
arouse
the
same
poetic
feeling
as
they
experi
enced
.
she
simply
enjoyed
their
pleasure
and
tried
to
fit
in
with
it
.
she
only
really
took
part
when
they
recalled
book
seven
s6nyas
first
arrival
.
she
told
them
how
afraid
she
had
been
of
nicholas
because
he
had
on
a
corded
jacket
and
her
nurse
had
told
her
that
she
too
would
be
sewn
up
with
cords
.
and
i
remember
their
telling
me
that
you
had
been
born
under
a
cabbage
said
natdsha
and
i
remember
that
i
dared
not
disbelieve
it
then
but
knew
that
it
was
not
true
and
i
felt
so
uncomfortable
.
while
they
were
talking
a
maid
thrust
her
head
in
at
the
other
door
of
the
sitting
room
.
they
have
brought
the
cock
miss
she
said
in
a
whisper
.
it
isnt
wanted
p61ya
.
tell
them
to
take
it
away
replied
natdsha
.
in
the
middle
of
their
talk
in
the
sitting
room
dimmler
came
in
and
went
up
to
the
harp
that
stood
there
in
a
corner
.
he
took
off
its
cloth
covering
and
the
harp
gave
out
a
jar
ring
sound
.
mr
.
dimmler
please
play
my
favorite
noc
turne
by
field
came
the
old
countess
voice
from
the
drawing
room
.
dimmler
struck
a
chord
and
turning
to
na
tasha
nicholas
and
sonya
remarked
how
quiet
you
young
people
are
yes
were
philosophizing
said
natdsha
glancing
round
for
a
moment
and
then
con
tinuing
the
conversation
.
they
were
now
dis
cussing
dreams
.
dimmler
began
to
play
natasha
went
on
tiptoe
noiselessly
to
the
table
took
up
a
can
dle
carried
it
out
and
returned
seating
her
self
quietly
in
her
former
place
.
it
was
dark
in
the
room
especially
where
they
were
sitting
on
the
sofa
but
through
the
big
windows
the
sil
very
light
of
the
full
moon
fell
on
the
floor
.
dimmler
had
finished
the
piece
but
still
sat
softly
running
his
fingers
over
the
strings
evi
dently
uncertain
whether
to
stop
or
to
play
something
else
.
do
you
know
said
natdsha
in
a
whisper
moving
closer
to
nicholas
and
s6nya
that
when
one
goes
on
and
on
recalling
memories
one
at
last
begins
to
remember
what
happened
before
one
was
in
the
world

that
is
metempsychosis
said
s6nya
who
had
always
learned
well
and
remembered
everything
.
the
egyptians
believed
that
our
souls
have
lived
in
animals
and
will
go
back
into
animals
again
.
no
i
dont
believe
we
ever
were
in
ani
mals
said
natdsha
still
in
a
whisper
though
the
music
had
ceased
.
but
i
am
certain
that
we
were
angels
somewhere
there
and
have
been
here
and
that
is
why
we
remember
.

.

.

.
may
i
join
you
said
dimmler
who
had
come
up
quietly
and
he
sat
down
by
them
.
if
we
have
been
angels
why
have
we
fallen
lower
said
nicholas
.
no
that
cant
be
not
lower
who
said
we
were
lower

.

.

.
how
do
i
know
what
i
was
before
natdsha
rejoined
with
conviction
.
the
soul
is
immor
talwell
then
if
i
shall
always
live
i
must
have
lived
before
lived
for
a
whole
eternity
.
yes
but
it
is
hard
for
us
to
imagine
eter
nity
remarked
dimmler
who
had
joined
the
young
folk
with
a
mildly
condescending
smile
but
now
spoke
as
quietly
and
seriously
as
they
.
why
is
it
hard
to
imagine
eternity
said
natasha
.
it
is
now
today
and
it
will
be
to
morrow
and
always
and
there
was
yesterday
and
the
day
before
.

.

.

.
natdsha
now
its
your
turn
.
sing
me
some
thing
they
heard
the
countess
say
.
why
are
you
sitting
there
like
conspirators
mamma
i
dont
at
all
want
to
replied
natdsha
but
all
the
same
she
rose
.
none
of
them
not
even
the
middleaged
dimmler
wanted
to
break
off
their
conversa
tion
and
quit
that
corner
in
the
sitting
room
but
natdsha
got
up
and
nicholas
sat
down
at
the
clavichord
.
standing
as
usual
in
the
mid
dle
of
the
hall
and
choosing
the
place
where
the
resonance
was
best
natdsha
began
to
sing
her
mothers
favorite
song
.
she
had
said
she
did
not
want
to
sing
but
it
was
long
since
she
had
sung
and
long
before
she
again
sang
as
she
did
that
evening
.
the
count
from
his
study
where
he
was
talking
to
mitenka
heard
her
and
like
a
schoolboy
in
a
hurry
to
run
out
to
play
blundered
in
his
talk
while
giving
orders
to
the
steward
and
at
last
stopped
while
mftenka
stood
in
front
of
him
also
listening
and
smiling
.
nicholas
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
his
sister
and
drew
breath
in
time
with
her
.
sonya
as
she
listened
thought
of
the
immense
difference
there
was
between
herself
and
her
friend
and
how
impossible
it
was
for
her
to
be
anything
like
as
bewitching
as
her
cousin
.
the
old
countess
sat
with
a
bliss
ful
yet
sad
smile
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
oc
casionally
shaking
her
head
.
she
thought
of
natdsha
and
of
her
own
youth
and
of
how
there
was
something
unnatural
and
dreadful
in
this
impending
marriage
of
natdsha
and
prince
andrew
.
dimmler
who
had
seated
himself
beside
the
countess
listened
with
closed
eyes
.
ah
countess
he
said
at
last
thats
a
euro
pean
talent
she
has
nothing
to
learn
what
softness
tenderness
and
strength
.

.

.

.
war
and
peace
ah
how
afraid
i
am
for
her
how
afraid
i
ami
said
the
countess
not
realizing
to
whom
she
was
speaking
.
her
maternal
instinct
told
her
that
natisha
had
too
much
of
something
and
that
because
of
this
she
would
not
be
hap
py
.
before
natdsha
had
finished
singing
four
teenyearold
ptya
rushed
in
delightedly
to
say
that
some
mummers
had
arrived
.
natasha
stopped
abruptly
.
idiot
i
she
screamed
at
her
brother
and
running
to
a
chair
threw
herself
on
it
sobbing
so
violently
that
she
could
not
stop
for
a
long
time
.
its
nothing
mamma
really
its
nothing
only
ptya
startled
me
she
said
trying
to
smile
but
her
tears
still
flowed
and
sobs
still
choked
her
.
the
mummers
some
of
the
house
serfs
dressed
up
as
bears
turks
innkeepers
and
ladiesfrightening
and
funny
bringing
in
with
them
the
cold
from
outside
and
a
feeling
of
gaiety
crowded
at
first
timidly
into
the
anteroom
then
hiding
behind
one
another
they
pushed
into
the
ballroom
where
shyly
at
first
and
then
more
and
more
merrily
and
heartily
they
started
singing
dancing
and
playing
christmas
games
.
the
countess
when
she
had
identified
them
and
laughed
at
their
costumes
went
into
the
drawing
room
.
the
count
sat
in
the
ballroom
smiling
radiantly
and
applaud
ing
the
players
.
the
young
people
had
disap
peared
.
half
an
hour
later
there
appeared
among
the
other
mummers
in
the
ballroom
an
old
lady
in
a
hooped
skirt
this
was
nicholas
.
a
turkish
girl
was
ptya
.
a
clown
was
dimmler
.
an
hussar
was
natasha
and
a
circassian
was
s6nya
with
burntcork
mustache
and
eyebrows
.
after
the
condescending
surprise
nonrecog
nition
and
praise
from
those
who
were
not
themselves
dressed
up
the
young
people
de
cided
that
their
costumes
were
so
good
that
they
ought
to
be
shown
elsewhere
.
nicholas
who
as
the
roads
were
in
splendid
condition
wanted
to
take
them
all
for
a
drive
in
his
troyka
proposed
to
take
with
them
about
a
dozen
of
the
serf
mummers
and
drive
to
un
cles
.
no
why
disturb
the
old
fellow
said
the
countess
.
besides
you
wouldnt
have
room
to
turn
round
there
.
if
you
must
go
go
to
the
melyuk6vs
.
melyuk6va
was
a
widow
who
with
her
fami
ly
and
their
tutors
and
governesses
lived
three
miles
from
the
rost6vs
.
thats
right
my
dear
chimed
in
the
old
count
thoroughly
aroused
.
ill
dress
up
at
once
and
go
with
them
.
ill
make
pashetteopen
her
eyes
.
but
the
countess
would
not
agree
to
his
go
ing
he
had
had
a
bad
leg
all
these
last
days
.
it
was
decided
that
the
count
must
not
go
but
that
if
louisa
ivdnovna
madame
schoss
would
go
with
them
the
young
ladies
might
go
to
the
melyuk6vs
s6nya
generally
so
timid
and
shy
more
urgently
than
anyone
begging
louisa
ivanovna
not
to
refuse
.
s6nyas
costume
was
the
best
of
all
.
her
mus
tache
and
eyebrows
were
extraordinarily
be
coming
.
everyone
told
her
she
looked
very
handsome
and
she
was
in
a
spirited
and
ener
getic
mood
unusual
with
her
.
some
inner
voice
told
her
that
now
or
never
her
fate
would
be
decided
and
in
her
male
attire
she
seemed
quite
a
different
person
.
louisa
ivdnovna
con
sented
to
go
and
in
half
an
hour
four
troyka
sleighs
with
large
and
small
bells
their
run
ners
squeaking
and
whistling
over
the
frozen
snow
drove
up
to
the
porch
.
natasha
was
foremost
in
setting
a
merry
holi
day
tone
which
passing
from
one
to
another
grew
stronger
and
stronger
and
reached
its
climax
when
they
all
came
out
into
the
frost
and
got
into
the
sleighs
talking
calling
to
one
another
laughing
and
shouting
.
two
of
the
troykas
were
the
usual
house
hold
sleighs
the
third
was
the
old
counts
with
a
trotter
from
the
orl6v
stud
as
shaft
horse
the
fourth
was
nicholas
own
with
a
short
shag
gy
black
shaft
horse
.
nicholas
in
his
old
ladys
dress
over
which
he
had
belted
his
hussar
over
coat
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
sleigh
reins
in
hand
.
it
was
so
light
that
he
could
see
the
moon
light
reflected
from
the
metal
harness
disks
and
from
the
eyes
of
the
horses
who
looked
round
in
alarm
at
the
noisy
party
under
the
shadow
of
the
porch
roof
.
natdsha
s6nya
madame
schoss
and
two
maids
got
into
nicholas
sleigh
dimmler
his
wife
and
ptya
into
the
old
counts
and
the
rest
of
the
mummers
seated
themselves
in
the
other
two
sleighs
.
you
go
ahead
zakhdrl
shouted
nicholas
to
his
fathers
coachman
wishing
for
a
chance
to
race
past
him
.
the
old
counts
troyka
with
dimmler
and
his
party
started
forward
squeaking
on
its
runners
as
though
freezing
to
the
snow
its
deeptoned
bell
clanging
.
the
side
horses
pressing
against
the
shafts
of
the
middle
horse
sank
in
the
snow
which
was
dry
and
book
seven
glittered
like
sugar
and
threw
it
up
.
nicholas
set
off
following
the
first
sleigh
behind
him
the
others
moved
noisily
their
runners
squeaking
.
at
first
they
drove
at
a
steady
trot
along
the
narrow
road
.
while
they
drove
past
the
garden
the
shadows
of
the
bare
trees
often
fell
across
the
road
and
hid
the
brilliant
moonlight
but
as
soon
as
they
were
past
the
fence
the
snowy
plain
bathed
in
moon
light
and
motionless
spread
out
before
them
glittering
like
diamonds
and
dappled
with
bluish
shadows
.
bang
bang
went
the
first
sleigh
over
a
cradle
hole
in
the
snow
of
the
road
and
each
of
the
other
sleighs
jolted
in
the
same
way
and
rudely
breaking
the
frost
bound
stillness
the
troykas
began
to
speed
along
the
road
one
after
the
other
.
a
hares
track
a
lot
of
tracks
rang
out
na
tashas
voice
through
the
frostbound
air
.
how
light
it
is
nicholas
came
s6nyas
voice
.
nicholas
glanced
round
at
s6nya
and
bent
down
to
see
her
face
closer
.
quite
a
new
sweet
face
with
black
eyebrows
and
mustaches
peeped
up
at
him
from
her
sable
furs
so
close
and
yet
so
distant
in
the
moonlight
.
that
used
to
be
s6nya
thought
he
and
looked
at
her
closer
and
smiled
.
what
is
it
nicholas
nothing
said
he
and
turned
again
to
the
horses
.
when
they
came
out
onto
the
beaten
high
roadpolished
by
sleigh
runners
and
cut
up
by
roughshod
hoofs
the
marks
of
which
were
visible
in
the
moonlight
the
horses
began
to
tug
at
the
reins
of
their
own
accord
and
in
creased
their
pace
.
the
near
side
horse
arch
ing
his
head
and
breaking
into
a
short
canter
tugged
at
his
traces
.
the
shaft
horse
swayed
from
side
to
side
moving
his
ears
as
if
asking
isnt
it
time
to
begin
now
in
front
already
far
ahead
the
deep
bell
of
the
sleigh
ringing
farther
and
farther
off
the
black
horses
driven
by
zakhar
could
be
clearly
seen
against
the
white
snow
.
from
that
sleigh
one
could
hear
the
shouts
laughter
and
voices
of
the
mum
mers
.
gee
up
my
darlings
shouted
nicholas
pulling
the
reins
to
one
side
and
flourishing
the
whip
.
it
was
only
by
the
keener
wind
that
met
them
and
the
jerks
given
by
the
side
horses
who
pulled
harder
ever
increasing
their
gal
lopthat
one
noticed
how
fast
the
troyka
was
flying
.
nicholas
looked
back
.
with
screams
squeals
and
waving
of
whips
that
caused
even
the
shaft
horses
to
gallop
the
other
sleighs
fol
lowed
.
the
shaft
horse
swung
steadily
beneath
the
bow
over
its
head
with
no
thought
of
slackening
pace
and
ready
to
put
on
speed
when
required
.
nicholas
overtook
the
first
sleigh
.
they
were
driving
downhill
and
coming
out
upon
a
broad
trodden
track
across
a
meadow
near
a
river
.
where
are
we
thought
he
.
its
the
kos6y
meadow
i
suppose
.
but
no
this
is
something
new
ive
never
seen
before
.
this
isnt
the
ko
soy
meadow
nor
the
demkin
hill
and
heaven
only
knows
what
it
is
it
is
something
new
and
enchanted
.
well
whatever
it
may
be

.

.

.
and
shouting
to
his
horses
he
began
to
pass
the
first
sleigh
.
zakhar
held
back
his
horses
and
turned
his
face
which
was
already
covered
with
hoarfrost
to
his
eyebrows
.
nicholas
gave
the
horses
the
rein
and
zak
hdr
stretching
out
his
arms
clucked
his
tongue
and
let
his
horses
go
.
now
look
out
master
he
cried
.
faster
still
the
two
troykas
flew
side
by
side
and
faster
moved
the
feet
of
the
galloping
side
horses
.
nicholas
began
to
draw
ahead
.
zakhar
while
still
keeping
his
arms
extended
raised
one
hand
with
the
reins
.
no
you
wont
master
he
shouted
.
nicholas
put
all
his
horses
to
a
gallop
and
passed
zakhar
.
the
horses
showered
the
fine
dry
snow
on
the
faces
of
those
in
the
sleigh
beside
them
sounded
quick
ringing
bells
and
they
caught
confused
glimpses
of
swiftly
mov
ing
legs
and
the
shadows
of
the
troyka
they
were
passing
.
the
whistling
sound
of
the
run
ners
on
the
snow
and
the
voices
of
girls
shriek
ing
were
heard
from
different
sides
.
again
checking
his
horses
nicholas
looked
around
him
.
they
were
still
surrounded
by
the
magic
plain
bathed
in
moonlight
andspangled
with
stars
.
zakhdr
is
shouting
that
i
should
turn
to
the
left
but
why
to
the
left
thought
nicholas
.
are
we
getting
to
the
melyuk6vs
is
this
mel
yukovka
heaven
only
knows
where
we
are
go
ing
and
heaven
knows
what
is
happening
to
us
but
ft
is
very
strange
and
pleasant
what
ever
it
is
.
and
he
looked
round
in
the
sleigh
.
look
his
mustache
and
eyelashes
are
all
white
said
one
of
the
strange
pretty
unfa
miliar
people
the
one
with
fine
eyebrows
and
mustache
.
i
think
this
used
to
be
natasha
thought
nicholas
and
that
was
madame
schoss
but
perhaps
its
not
and
this
circassian
with
the
war
and
peace
mustache
i
dont
know
but
i
love
her
.
arent
you
cold
he
asked
.
they
did
not
answer
but
began
to
laugh
.
dimmler
from
the
sleigh
behind
shouted
some
thing
probably
something
funny
but
they
could
not
make
out
what
he
said
.
yes
yes
some
voices
answered
laughing
.
but
here
was
a
fairy
forest
with
black
mov
ing
shadows
and
a
glitter
of
diamonds
and
a
flight
of
marble
steps
and
the
silver
roofs
of
fairy
buildings
and
the
shrill
yells
of
some
ani
mals
.
and
if
this
is
really
melyuk6vka
it
is
still
stranger
that
we
drove
heaven
knows
where
and
have
come
to
melyuk6vka
thought
nich
olas
.
it
really
was
melyuk6vka
and
maids
and
footmen
with
merry
faces
came
running
out
to
the
porch
carrying
candles
.
who
is
it
asked
someone
in
the
porch
the
mummers
from
the
counts
.
i
know
by
the
horses
replied
some
voices
.

a
broadly
built
energetic
woman
wearing
spectacles
sat
in
the
drawing

in
a
loose

sur
rounded
by
her
daughters
whom
she
was
try
ing
to
keep
from

they
were
quiet
ly
dropping
melted
wax
into

and
looking
at
the
shadows
the
wax
figures
would
throw
on
the

when
they
heard
the
steps
and
voices
of
new

in

hussars
ladies
witches
clowns

after
clearing
their

into

having
given
orders
to
clear
the
rooms
for
the
visitors
and
arranged
about
refreshments
for
the
gentry
and
the
serfs
went
about
among
the
mummers
without
re
moving
her
spectacles
peering
into
their
faces
with
a
suppressed
smile
and
failing
to
recog
nize
any
of
them
.
it
was
not
merely
dimmler
and
the
rost6vs
she
failed
to
recognize
she
did
not
even
recognize
her
own
daughters
or
her
late
husbands
dressing
gowns
and
uniforms
which
they
had
put
on
.
and
who
is
this
she
asked
her
governess
peering
into
the
face
of
her
own
daughter
dressed
up
as
a
kazdntartar
.

suppose
it
is

she
ordered
the
butler
who
was
handing
things
round
.
thats
not
forbidden
by

sometimes
as
she
looked
at
the
strange
but
amusing
capers
cut
by
the
dancers
who
hav
ing
decided
once
for
all
that
being

no
one
would
recognize

hid
her
face
in

her
whole

with

laughter

at

she
said

after
russian
country
dances
and

dances
pelagdya
danflovna
made
the
serfs
and
gentry
join
in
one
large
circle
a
ring
a
string
and
a
silver
ruble
were
fetched
and
they
all
played
games
together
.
in
an
hour
all
the
costumes
were
crumpled
and
disordered
.
the
corked
eyebrows
and
mus
taches
were
smeared
over
the
perspiring
flushed
and
merry
faces
.
pelageya
danilovna
began
to
recognize
the
mummers
admired
their
cleverly
contrived
costumes
and
particu
larly
how
they
suited
the
young
ladies
and
she
thanked
them
all
for
having
entertained
her
so
well
.
the
visitors
were
invited
to
supper
in
the
drawing
room
and
the
serfs
had
something
served
to
them
in
the
ballroom
.
now
to
tell
ones
fortune
in
the
empty
bath
house
is
frightening
said
an
old
maid
who
lived
with
the
melyuk6vs
during

well
began
the
old
maid
a
young
lady
once
went
out
took
a
cock
laid
the
table
for
two
all
properly
and
sat
down
.
after
sitting
a
while
she
suddenly
hears
someone
coming

.

.

.
a
sleigh
drives
up
with
harness
bells
she
hears
him
coming
he
comes
in
just
in
the
shape
of
a
man
like
an
officer
comes
in
and
sits
down
to
table
with
her
.
ah
ah
screamed
natdsha
rolling
her
eyes
with
horror
.
yes
and
how

.

.

.
did
he
speak
yes
like
a
man
.
everything
quite
all
right
and
he
began
persuading
her
and
she
should
have
kept
him
talking
till
cockcrow
but
shegot
frightened
just
got
frightened
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
.
then
he
caught
her
up
.
it
was
lucky
the
maids
ran
in
just
then
.

.

.

.
now
why
frighten
them
said
pelagdya
danflovna
.
mamma
you
used
to
try
your
fate
your
self

.

.

.
said
her
daughter
.
and
how
does
one
do
it
in
a
barn
in
quired
s6nya
.
well
say
you
went
to
the
barn
now
and
lis
tened
.
it
depends
on
what
you
hear
hammer
ing
and
knocking
thats
bad
but
a
sound
of
shifting
grain
is
good
and
one
sometimes
hears
that
too
.
mamma
tell
us
what
happened
to
you
in
the
barn
.
pelagya
danilovna
smiled
.
oh
ive
forgotten

.

.

.
she
replied
.
but
none
of
you
would
go
yes
i
will
pelagya
danilovna
let
mel
ill
go
said
s6nya
.
well
why
not
if
youre
not
afraid
louisa
ivanovna
may
i
asked
s6nya
.
whether
they
were
playing
the
ring
and
string
game
or
the
ruble
game
or
talking
as
now
nicholas
did
not
leave
s6nyas
side
and
gazed
at
her
with
quite
new
eyes
.
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
only
today
thanks
to
that
burnt
cork
mustache
that
he
had
fully
learned
to
know
her
.
and
really
that
evening
s6nya
was
brighter
more
animated
and
prettier
than
nicholas
had
ever
seen
her
before
.
so
thats
what
she
is
like
what
a
fool
i
have
been
he
thought
gazing
at
her
sparkling
eyes
and
under
the
mustache
a
happy
rapturous
smile
dimpled
her
cheeks
a
smile
he
had
never
seen
before
.
im
not
afraid
of
anything
said
s6nya
.
may
i
go
at
once
she
got
up
.
they
told
her
where
the
barn
was
and
how
she
should
stand
and
listen
and
they
handed
her
a
fur
cloak
.
she
threw
this
over
her
head
and
shoulders
and
glanced
at
nicholas
.
what
a
darling
that
girl
is
thought
he
.
and
what
have
i
been
thinking
of
till
now
s6nya
went
out
into
the
passage
to
go
to
the
barn
.
nicholas
went
hastily
to
the
front
porch
saying
he
felt
too
hot
.
the
crowd
of
people
really
had
made
the
house
stuffy
.
outside
there
was
the
same
cold
stillness
and
the
same
moon
but
even
brighter
than
before
.
the
light
was
so
strong
and
the
snow
sparkled
with
so
many
stars
that
one
did
not
wish
to
look
up
at
the
sky
and
the
real
stars
were
un
noticed
.
the
sky
was
black
and
dreary
while
the
earth
was
gay
.
i
am
a
fool
a
fool
what
have
i
been
wait
ing
for
thought
nicholas
and
running
out
from
the
porch
he
went
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
along
the
path
that
led
to
the
back
porch
.
he
knew
sonya
would
pass
that
way
.
halfway
lay
some
snowcovered
piles
of
firewood
and
across
and
along
them
a
network
of
shadows
from
the
bare
old
lime
trees
fell
on
the
snow
and
on
the
path
.
this
path
led
to
the
barn
.
the
log
walls
of
the
barn
and
its
snow
covered
roof
that
looked
as
if
hewn
out
of
some
precious
stone
sparkled
in
the
moon
light
.
a
tree
in
the
garden
snapped
with
the
frost
and
then
all
was
again
perfectly
silent
.
his
bosom
seemed
to
inhale
not
air
but
the
strength
of
eternal
youth
and
gladness
.
from
the
back
porch
came
the
sound
of
feet
descending
the
steps
the
bottom
step
upon
which
snow
had
fallen
gave
a
ringing
creak
and
he
heard
the
voice
of
an
old
maidservant
say
ing
straight
straight
along
the
path
miss
.
only
dont
look
back
.
i
am
not
afraid
answered
s6nyas
voice
and
along
the
path
toward
nicholas
came
the
crunching
whistling
sound
of
s6nyas
feet
in
her
thin
shoes
.
s6nya
came
along
wrapped
in
her
cloak
.
she
was
only
a
couple
of
paces
away
when
she
saw
him
and
to
her
too
he
was
not
the
nich
olas
she
had
known
and
always
slightly
feared
.
he
was
in
a
womans
dress
with
tousled
hair
and
a
happy
smile
new
to
s6nya
.sheran
rapid
ly
toward
him
.
quite
different
and
yet
the
same
thought
nicholas
looking
at
her
face
all
lit
up
by
the
moonlight
.
he
slipped
his
arms
under
the
cloak
that
covered
her
head
embraced
her
pressed
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
that
wore
a
mustache
and
had
a
smell
of
burnt
cork
.
s6nya
kissed
him
full
on
the
lips
and
disengaging
her
little
hands
pressed
them
to
his
cheeks
.

was
all
they
said
.
they
ran
to
the
barn
and
then
back
again
reentering
he
by
the
front
and
she
by
the
back
porch
.
chapter
xii
when
they
all
drove
back
from
pelageya
danilovnas
natasha
who
always
saw
and
no
ticed
everything
arranged
that
she
and
ma
dame
schoss
should
go
back
in
the
sleigh
with
dimmler
and
sonya
with
nicholas
and
the
maids
.
on
the
way
back
nicholas
drove
at
a
steady
pace
instead
of
racing
and
kept
peering
by
that
fantastic
alltransforming
light
into
s6nyas
face
and
searching
beneath
the
eyebrows
and
mustache
for
his
former
and
his
present
sonya
from
whom
he
had
resolved
never
to
be
parted
again
.
he
looked
and
recognizing
in
her
both
the
old
and
the
news6nyaandbeingreminded
by
the
smell
of
burnt
cork
of
the
sensation
of
her
kiss
inhaled
the
frosty
air
with
a
lull
breast
and
looking
at
the
ground
flying
beneath
him
and
at
the
sparkling
sky
felt
himself
again
in
fairyland
.
sonya
is
it
well
with
thee
he
asked
from
time
to
time
.
yes
she
replied
.
and
with
thee
when
halfway
home
nicholas
handed
the
reins
to
the
coachman
and
ran
for
a
moment
to
natashas
sleigh
and
stood
on
its
wing
.
natasha
he
whispered
in
french
do
you
know
i
have
made
up
my
mind
about
sonya
have
you
told
her
asked
natasha
sud
denly
beaming
all
over
with
joy
.
oh
how
strange
you
are
with
that
mus
tache
and
those
eyebrows

.

.

.
natasha
are
you
glad
i
am
so
glad
so
glad
i
was
beginning
to
be
vexed
with
you
.
i
did
not
tell
you
but
you
have
been
treating
her
badly
.
what
a
heart
she
has
nicholas
i
am
horrid
sometimes
but
i
was
ashamed
to
be
happy
while
sonya
was
not
continued
natasha
.
now
i
am
so
glad
well
run
back
to
her
.
no
wait
a
bit
.

.

.

.
oh
how
funny
you
look
cried
nicholas
peering
into
her
face
and
find
ing
in
his
sister
too
something
new
unusual
and
bewitchingly
tender
that
he
had
not
seen
in
her
before
.
natlsha
its
magical
isnt
it
yes
she
replied
.
you
have
done
splendid
ly
.
had
i
seen
her
before
as
she
is
now
thought
nicholas
i
should
long
ago
have
asked
her
what
to
do
and
have
done
whatever
she
told
me
and
all
would
have
been
well
.
so
you
are
glad
and
i
have
done
right
oh
quite
right
i
had
a
quarrel
with
mam
ma
some
time
ago
about
it
.
mamma
said
she
was
angling
for
you
.
how
could
she
say
such
a
thing
i
nearly
stormed
at
mamma
.
i
will
never
let
anyone
say
anything
bad
of
s6nya
for
there
is
nothing
but
good
in
her
.
then
its
all
right
said
nicholas
again
scrutinizing
the
expression
of
his
sisters
face
to
see
if
she
was
in
earnest
.
then
he
jumped
down
and
his
boots
scrunching
the
snow
ran
back
to
his
sleigh
.
the
same
happy
smilingcir
cassian
with
mustache
and
beaming
eyes
look
ing
up
from
under
a
sablehood
was
still
sitting
there
and
that
circassian
was
s6nya
and
that
scmya
was
certainly
his
future
happy
and
lov
ing
wife
.
when
they
reached
home
and
had
told
their
mother
how
they
had
spent
the
evening
at
the
melyukrivs
the
girls
went
to
their
bedroom
.
when
they
had
undressed
but
without
wash
ing
off
the
cork
mustaches
they
sat
a
long
time
talking
of
their
happiness
.
they
talked
of
how
they
would
live
when
they
were
married
how
their
husbands
would
be
friends
and
how
hap
py
they
would
be
.
on
natashas
table
stood
two
looking
glasses
which
dunydsha
had
pre
pared
beforehand
.
only
when
will
all
that
be
i
am
afraid
nev
er

.
it
would
be
too
good
said
natdsha
rising
and
going
to
the
looking
glasses
.
sit
down
natasha
perhaps
youll
see
him
said
sonya
.
natasha
lit
the
candles
one
on
each
side
of
one
of
the
looking
glasses
and
sat
down
.
i
see
someone
with
a
mustache
said
na
tasha
seeing
her
own
face
.
you
mustnt
laugh
miss
said
dunyasha
.
with
s6nyas
help
and
the
maids
natdsha
got
the
glass
she
held
into
the
right
position
opposite
the
other
her
face
assumed
a
serious
expression
and
she
sat
silent
.
she
sat
a
long
time
looking
at
the
receding
line
of
candles
re
flected
in
the
glasses
and
expecting
from
tales
she
had
heard
to
see
a
coffin
or
him
prince
andrew
in
that
last
dim
indistinctly
outlined
square
.
but
ready
as
she
was
to
take
the
small
est
speck
for
the
image
of
a
man
or
of
a
coffin
she
saw
nothing
.
she
began
blinking
rapidly
and
moved
away
from
the
looking
glasses
.
why
is
it
others
see
things
arid
i
dont
she
said
.
you

i

so
frightened
s6nya

before
the
glasses
got
the
right
position
and
began
looking

now
miss
s6nya
is
sure
to
see
something
whispered
dunydsha
while
you
do
nothing
but
laugh
.
s6nya
heard
this
and
natashas
whisper
i
know
she
will
.
she
saw
something
last
year
.
for
about
three
minutes
all
were
silent
.
of
course
she
will
whispered
natasha
but
did
not
finish

.

.

.
suddenly
s6nya
pushed
away
the
glass
she
was
holding
and
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hand
.
oh
natdsha
she
cried
.
did
you
see
did
you
what

it
ex

natdsha
holding
up
the
looking
glass
.
s6nya
had
not
seen
anything
she
was
just
wanting
to
blink
and
to
get
up
when
she
heard
natdsha
say
of
course
she
will
she
did
not
wish
to
disappoint

dunyashaor
natasha
but
it
was
hard
to
sit
still
.
she
did
not
herself
know
how
or
why
the
exclamation
escaped
her
when
she
covered
her
eyes
.
you
saw
him
urged
natasha
seizing
her
hand
.
yes

bit

not

not
yet
knowing
whom
natasha
meant
by
him
nicholas
or
prince
an

but
why
shouldnt
i
say
i
saw
something
others

besides
who

whether

the
contrary
on
the
contrary
his
face
was
cheerful
and
he
turned
to
me
.
and
when
saying
this
she
herself
fancied
she
had
really
seen
what
she
described
.
well
and
then
s6nya

natisha
began
and
without
replying
to
s6nyas
words
of
comfort
she
got
into
bed
and
long
after
her
candle
was
out
lay
openeyed
and
mo
tionless
gazing
at
the
moonlight
through
the
frosty
windowpanes
.
chapter

soon
after
the
christmas
holidays
nicholas
told
his
mother
of
his
love
for
s6nya
and
of
his
firm
resolve
to
marry
her
.
the
countess
who
had
long
noticed
what
was
going
on
between
them
and
was
expecting
this
declaration
lis
tened
to
him
in
silence
and
then
told
her
son
that
he
might
marry
whom
he
pleased
but
that
neither
she
nor
his
father
would
give
their
blessing
to
such
a
marriage
.
nicholas
for
the
first
time
felt
that
his
mother
was
displeased
with
him
and
that
despite
her
love
for
him
she
would
not
give
way
.
coldly
without
look
ing
at
her
son
she
sent
for
her
husband
and
when
he
came
tried
briefly
and
coldly
to
in
form
him
of
the
facts
in
her
sons
presence
but
unable
to
restrain
herself
she
burst
into
tears
of
vexation
and
left
the
room
.
the
old
count
be
gan
irresolutely
to
admonish
nicholas
and
beg
him
to
abandon
his
purpose
.
nicholas
replied
that
he
could
not
go
back
on
his
word
and
his
father
sighing
and
evidently
disconcerted
very
soon
became
silent
and
went
in
to
the
countess
.
in
all
his
encounters
with
his
son
the
count
was
always
conscious
of
his
own
guilt
toward
him
for
having
wasted
the
family
fortune
and
so
he
could
not
be
angry
with
him
for
refus
ing
to
marry
an
heiress
and
choosing
the
dower
less
s6nya
.
on
this
occasion
he
was
only
more
vividly
conscious
of
the
fact
that
if
his
affairs
had
not
been
in
disorder
no
better
wife
for
nicholas
than
s6nya
could
have
been
wished
for
and
that
no
one
but
himself
with
his
mi
tenka
and
his
uncomfortable
habits
was
to
blame
for
the
condition
of
the
family
finances
.
the
father
and
mother
did
not
speak
of
the
matter
to
their
son
again
but
a
few
days
later
the
countess
sent
for
s6nya
and
with
a
cruelty
neither
of
them
expected
reproached
her
niece
for
trying
to
catch
nicholas
and
for
ingrati
tude
.
sonya
listened
silently
with
downcast
eyes
to
the
countess
cruel
words
without
under
standing
what
was
required
of
her
.
she
was
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
for
her
benefac
tors
.
selfsacrifice
was
her
most
cherished
idea
but
in
this
case
she
could
not
see
what
she
ought
to
sacrifice
or
for
whom
.
she
could
not
help
loving
the
countess
and
the
whole
rost6v
family
but
neither
could
she
help
loving
nich
olas
and
knowing
that
his
happiness
depended
on
that
love
.
she
was
silent
and
sad
and
did
not
reply
.
nicholas
felt
the
situation
to
be
in
tolerable
and
went
to
have
an
explanation
with
his
mother
.
he
first
implored
her
to
forgive
him
and
s6nya
and
consent
to
their
marriage
then
he
threatened
that
if
she
molested
s6nya
he
would
at
once
marry
her
secretly
.
the
countess
with
a
coldness
her
son
had
never
seen
in
her
before
replied
that
he
was
war
and
peace
of
age
that
prince
andrew
was
marrying
with
out
his
fathers
consent
and
he
could
do
the
same
but
that
she
would
never
receive
that
intriguer
as
her
daughter
.
exploding
at
the
word
intriguer
nicholas
raising
his
voice
told
his
mother
he
had
never
expected
her
to
try
to
force
him
to
sell
his
feel
ings
but
if
that
were
so
he
would
say
for
the
last
time

.

.

.
but
he
had
no
time
to
utter
the
de
cisive
word
which
the
expression
of
his
face
caused
his
mother
to
await
with
terror
and
which
would
perhaps
have
forever
remained
a
cruel
memory
to
them
both
.
he
had
not
time
to
say
it
for
natdsha
with
a
pale
and
set
face
entered
the
room
from
the
door
at
which
she
had
been
listening
.

she
almost
screamed
so
as
to
drown
his
voice
.

.
my
poor
sweet

she
said
to
her
mother
who
conscious
that
they
had
been
on
the
brink
of
a
rupture
gazed
at
her
son
with
terror
but
in
the
obstinacy
and
excitement
of
the
conflict
could
not
and
would
not
give
way
.

said
natdsha
.
her
words
were
incoherent
but
they
attained
the
purpose
at
which
she
was
aiming
.
the
countess
sobbing
heavily
hid
her
face
on
her
daughters
breast
while
nicholas
rose
clutching
his
head
and
left
the
room
.
natasha
set
to
work
to
effect
a
reconciliation
and
so
far
succeeded
that
nicholas
received
a
promise
from
his
mother
that
sonya
should
not
be
troubled
while
he
on
his
side
promised
not
to
undertake
anything
without
his
parents
knowledge
.
firmly
resolved
after

affairs

or

in
the
regiment
to
retire
from
the
army
and
return
and
marry
s6nya
nicholas
serious
sor
rowful
and
at
variance
with
his
parents
but
as
it
seemed
to
him
passionately
in
love
left
at
the
beginning
of
january
to
rejoin
his
regi
ment
.
after
nicholas
had
gone
things
in
the
ros
t6v
household
were
more
depressing
than
ever
and
the
countess
fell
ill
from
mental
agitation
.
s6nya
was
unhappy
at
the
separation
from
nicholas
and
still
more
so
on
account
of
the
hostile
tone
the
countess
could
not
help
adopt
ing
toward
her
.
the
count
was
more
perturbed
than
ever
by
the
condition
of
his
affairs
which
called
for
some
decisive
action
.
their
town
house
and
estate
near
moscow
had
inevitably
to
be
sold
and
for
this
they
had
to
go
to
mos
cow
.
but
the
countess
health
obliged
them
to
delay
their
departure
from
day
to
day
.
natasha
who
had
borne
the
first
period
of
separation
from
her
betrothed
lightly
and
even
cheerfully
now
grew
more
agitated
and
impa
tient
every
day
.
the
thought
that
her
best
days
which
she
would
have
employed
in
loving
him
were
being
vainly
wasted
with
no
advantage
to
anyone
tormented
her
incessantly
.
his
letters
for
the
most
part
irritated
her
.
it
hurt
her
to
think
that
while
she
lived
only
in
the
thought
of
him
he
was
living
a
real
life
seeing
new
places
and
new
people
that
interested
him
.
the
more
interesting
his
letters
were
the
more
vexed
she
felt
.
her
letters
to
him
far
from
giv
ing
her
any
comfort
seemed
to
her
a
wearisome
and
artificial
obligation
.
she
could
not
write
because
she
could
not
conceive
the
possibility
of
expressing
sincerely
in
a
letter
even
a
thou
sandth
part
of
what
she
expressed
by
voice
smile
and
glance
.
she
wrote
to
him
formal
monotonous
and
dry
letters
to
which
she
at
tached
no
importance
herself
and
in
the
rough
copies
of
which
the
countess
corrected
her
mis
takes
in
spelling
.
there
was
still
no
improvement
in
the
count
ess
health
but
it
was
impossible
to
defer
the
journey
to
moscowany
longer
.
natashas
trous

had
to
be
ordered
and
the
house
sold
.
moreover
prince
andrew
was
expected
in
moscow
where
old
pri
nee
bolk6nski
was
spend
ing
the
winter
and
natdsha
felt
sure
he
had
al
ready
arrived
.
so
the
countess
remained
in
the
country
and
the
count
taking
s6nya
and
natdsha
with
him
went
to
moscow
at
the
end
of

loathsome

such
a
life
that
the
countess
hdlene
thought
it
necessary
to
speak
severely
to
him
about
it
.
pierre
felt
that
she
was
right
and
to
avoid

her
went
away
to
moscow

still
lived

felt
himself

in

he
felt

would

there
was
never

then
to

and
then
a

and
the

had
he
not
seen
the

passionately
desired
the
regen

of
the
sinful

his
own

had
he
not
established

and
liberated

but
instead
of

thathere
he
was
the

of

of

as
he
unbuttoned

abusing
the
government
a
bit
a
member
of
the
moscow
english
club
and
a
universal
fa
vorite
in
moscow
society
.
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
reconcile
himself
to
the
idea
that
he
was
one
of
those
same
retired
moscow
gentle
meninwaiting
he
had
so
despised
seven
years
before
.
sometimes
he
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
was
only
living
this
life
tem
porarily
but
then
he
was
shocked
by
the
thought
of
how
many
like
himself
had
en
tered
that
life
and
that
club
temporarily
with
all
their
teeth
and
hair
and
had
only
left
it
when
not
a
single
tooth
or
hair
remained
.
in
moments
of
pride
when
he
thought
of
his
position
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
quite
different
and
distinct
from
those
other
retired
gentlemeninwaiting
he
had
formerly
de
spised
they
were
empty

satisfied
with
their
position
while
i
am
still
discontented
and
want

do
something
for
mankind
.
but
perhaps
all
these
comrades
of
minestruggled
just
like
me
and
sought
some
thing
new
a
path
in
life
of
their
own
and
like
me
were
brought
by
force
of
circumstances

ciety
and
race
by
that
elemental
force
against
which
man

powerless

said
he
to
himself
in
moments
of
humility
and
after
living
some
time
in
moscow
he
no
longer
despised
but
began
to
grow
fond
of
to
respect
and
to
pity
his
comrades
in
destiny
as
he
pitied
himself
.
pierre
no
longer
suffered
moments
of
despair
hypochondria
and
disgust
with
life
but
the
malady
that
had
formerly
found
expression
in
such
acute
attacks
was
driven
inwards
and
nev
er
left
him
for
a
moment
.
what
for
why
what
is
going
on
in
the
world
he
would
ask
himself
in
perplexity
several
times
a
day
in
voluntarily
beginning
to
reflect
anew
on
the
meaning
of
the
phenomena
of
life
but
know
ing
by
experience
that
there
were
no
answers
to
these
questions
he
made
haste
to
turn
away
from
them
and
took
up
a
book
or
hurried
off
to
the
club
or
to

as
if
it
were
something
new
.
i
under
stand
the
deception
and
confusion
he
thought
but
how
am
i
to
tell
them
all
that
i
see
i
have
tried
and
have
always
found
that
they
too
in
the
depths
of
their
souls
under
stand
it
as
i
do
and
only
try
not
to
see
it
.
so
it
appears
that
it
must
be
so
but
iwhat
is
to
become
of
me
thought
he
.
he
had
the
unfor
tunate
capacity
many
men
especially
russians
have
of
seeing
and
believing
in
the
possibility
of
goodness
and
truth
but
of
seeing
the
evil
and
falsehood
of
life
too
clearly
to
be
able
to
take
a
serious
part
in
it
.
every
sphere
of
work
was
connected
in
his
eyes
with
evil
and
decep
tion
.
whatever
he
tried
to
be
whatever
he
en
gaged
in
the
evil
and
falsehood
of
it
repulsed
him
and
blocked
every
path
of
activity
.
yet
he
had
to
live
and
to
find
occupation
.
it
was
too
dreadful
to
be
under
the
burden
of
these
in
soluble
problems
so
he
abandoned
himself
to
any
distraction
in
order
to
forget
them
.
he
book
eight
35
frequented
every
kind
of
society
drank
much
bought
pictures
engaged
in
building
and
above
allread
.
he
read
and
read
everything
that
came
to
hand
.
on
coming
home
while
his
valets
were
still
taking
off
his
things
he
picked
up
a
book
and
began
to
read
.
from
reading
he
passed
to
sleeping
from
sleeping
to
gossip
in
drawing
rooms
of
the
club
from
gossip
to
carousals
and
women
from
carousals
back
to
gossip
reading
and
wine
.
drinking
became
more
and
more
a
physical
and
also
a
moral
necessity
.
though
the
doctors
warned
him
that
with
his
corpu
lence
wine
was
dangerous
for
him
he
drank
a
great
deal
.
he
was
only
quite
at
ease
when
having
poured
several
glasses
of
wine
mechan
ically
into
his
large
mouth
he
felt
a
pleasant
warmth
in
his
body
an
amiability
toward
all
his
fellows
and
a
readiness
to
respond
super
ficially
to
every
idea
without
probing
it
deep
ly
.
only
after
emptying
a
bottle
or
two
did
he
feel
dimly
that
the
terribly
tangled
skein
of
life
which
previously
had
terrified
him
was
not
as
dreadful
as
he
had
thought
.
he
was
always
conscious
of
some
aspect
of
that
skein
as
with
a
buzing
in
his
head
after
dinner
or
supper
he
chatted
or
listened
to
conversation
or
read
.
but
under
the
influence
of
wine
he
said
to
himself
it
doesnt
matter
.
ill
get
it
unraveled
.
i
have
a
solution
ready
but
have
no
time
now
ill
think
it
all
out
later
onl
but
the
later
on
never
came
.
in
the
morning
on
an
empty
stomach
all
the
old
questions
appeared
as
insoluble
and
terrible
as
ever
and
pierre
hastily
picked
up
a
book
and
if
anyone
came
to
see
him
he
was
glad
.
sometimes
he
remembered
how
he
had
heard
that
soldiers
in
war
when
entrenched
under
the
enemys
fire
if
they
have
nothing
to
do
try
hard
to
find
some
occupation
the
more
easily
to
bear
the
danger
.
to
pierre
all
men
seemed
like
those
soldiers
seeking
refuge
from
life
some
in
ambition
some
in
cards
some
in
fram
ing
laws
some
in
women
some
in
toys
some
in
horses
some
in
politics
some
in
sport
some
in
wine
and
some
in
governmental
affairs
.
nothing
is
trivial
and
nothing
is
important
its
all
the
same
only
to
save
oneself
from
it
as
best
one
can
thought
pierre
.
only
not
to
see
it
that
dreadful
it
chapter
ii
at
the
beginning
of
winter
prince
nicholas
bolk6nski
and
his
daughter
moved
to
moscow
.
at
that
time
enthusiasm
for
the
emperor
alex
anders
regime
had
weakened
and
a
patriotic
and
antifrench
tendency
prevailed
there
and
this
togetherwith
his
past
and
his
intellect
and
his
originality
at
once
made
prince
nicholas
bolkcmski
an
object
of
particular
respect
to
the
moscovites
and
the
center
of
the
moscow
opposition
to
the
government
.
the
prince
had
aged
very
much
that
year
.
he
showed
marked
signs
of
senility
by
a
tend
ency
to
fall
asleep
forgetfulness
of
quite
re
cent
events
remembrance
of
remote
ones
and
the
childish
vanity
with
which
he
accepted
the
role
of
head
of
the
moscow
opposition
.
in
spite
of
this
the
old
man
inspired
in
all
his
visitors
alike
a
feeling
of
respectful
veneration
especially
of
an
evening
when
he
came
in
to
tea
in
his
oldfashioned
coat
and
powdered
wig
and
aroused
by
anyone
told
his
abrupt
stories
of
the
past
or
uttered
yet
more
abrupt
and
scathing
criticisms
of
the
present
.
for
them
all
that
oldfashioned
house
with
its
gigantic
mirrors
prerevolution
furniture
powdered
footmen
and
the
stern
shrewd
old
man
him
self
a
relic
of
the
past
century
with
his
gentle
daughter
and
the
pretty
frenchwoman
who
were
reverently
devoted
to
him
presented
a
majestic
and
agreeable
spectacle
.
but
the
visi
tors
did
not
reflect
that
besides
the
couple
of
hours
during
which
they
saw
their
host
there
were
also
twentytwo
hours
in
the
day
during
which
the
private
and
intimate
lifeof
the
house
continued
.
latterly
that
private
life
had
become
very
trying
for
princess
mary
.
there
in
moscow
she
was
deprived
of
her
greatest
pleasures
talks
with
the
pilgrims
and
the
solitude
which
re
freshed
her
at
bald
hills
and
she
had
none
of
the
advantages
and
pleasures
of
city
life
.
she
did
not
go
out
into
society
everyone
knew
that
her
father
would
not
let
her
go
anywhere
without
him
and
his
failing
health
prevented
his
going
out
himself
so
that
she
was
not
in
vited
to
dinners
and
evening
parties
.
she
had
quite
abandoned
the
hope
of
getting
married
.
she
saw
the
coldness
and
malevolence
with
which
the
old
prince
received
and
dismissed
the
young
men
possible
suitors
who
some
times
appeared
at
their
house
.
she
had
no
friends
during
this
visit
to
moscow
she
had
been
disappointed
in
the
two
who
had
been
nearest
to
her
.
mademoiselle
bourienne
with
whom
she
had
never
been
able
to
be
quite
frank
had
now
become
unpleasant
to
her
and
for
various
reasons
princess
mary
avoided
her
.
julie
with
whom
she
had
corresponded
for
the
last
five
years
was
in
moscow
but
proved
306
war
and
peace
to
be
quite
alien
to
her
when
they
met
.
just
then
julie
who
by
the
death
of
her
brothers
had
become
one
of
the
richest
heiresses
in
mos
cow
was
in
the
full
whirl
of
society
pleasures
.
she
was
surrounded
by
young
men
who
she
fancied
had
suddenly
learned
to
appreciate
her
worth
.
julie
was
at
that
stage
in
the
life
of
a
society
woman
when
she
feels
that
her
last
chance
of
marrying
has
come
and
that
her
fate
must
be
decided
now
or
never
.
on
thursdays
princess
mary
remembered
with
a
mournful
smile
that
she
now
had
no
one
to
write
to
since
julie
whose
presence
gave
her
no
pleasure
was
here
and
they
met
every
week
.
like
the
old
emigrd
who
declined
to
marry
the
lady
with
whom
he
had
spent
his
evenings
for
years
she
regretted
julies
presence
and
having
no
one
to
write
to
.
in
moscow
princess
mary
had
no
one
to
talk
to
no
one
to
whom
to
confide
her
sor
row
and
much
sorrow
fell
to
her
lot
just
then
.
the
time
for
prince
andrews
return
and
mar
riage
was
approaching
but
his
request
to
her
to
prepare
his
father
for
it
had
not
been
car
ried
out
in
fact
it
seemed
as
if
matters
were
quite
hopeless
for
at
every
mention
of
the
young
countess
rost6va
the
old
prince
who
apart
from
that
was
usually
in
a
bad
temper
lost
control
of
himself
.
another
lately
added
sorrow
arose
from
the
lessons
she
gave
her
six
yearold
nephew
.
to
her
consternation
she
detected
in
herself
in
relation
to
little
nich
olas
some
symptoms
of
her
fathers
irritability
.
however
often
she
told
herself
that
she
must
not
get
irritable
when
teaching
her
nephew
almost
every
time
that
pointer
in
hand
she
sat
down
to
show
him
the
french
alphabet
she
so
longed
to
pour
her
own
knowledge
quickly
and
easily
into
the
child
who
was
al
ready
afraid
that
auntie
might
at
any
moment
get
angry
that
at
his
slightest
inattention
she
trembled
became
flustered
and
heated
raised
her
voice
and
sometimes
pulled
him
by
the
arm
and
put
him
in
the
corner
.
having
put
him
in
the
corner
she
would
herself
begin
to
cry
over
her
cruel
evil
nature
and
little
nicho
las
following
her
example
would
sob
and
without
permission
would
leave
his
corner
come
to
her
pull
her
wet
hands
from
her
face
and
comfort
her
.
but
what
distressed
the
prin
cess
most
of
all
was
her
fathers
irritability
which
was
always
directed
against
her
and
had
of
late
amounted
to
cruelty
.
had
he
forced
her
to
prostrate
herself
to
the
ground
all
night
had
he
beaten
her
or
made
her
fetch
wood
or
water
it
would
never
have
entered
her
mind
to
think
her
position
hard
but
this
loving
des
potthe
more
cruel
because
he
loved
her
and
for
that
reason
tormented
himself
and
her
knew
how
not
merely
to
hurt
and
humiliate
her
deliberately
but
to
show
her
that
she
was
always
to
blame
for
everything
.
of
late
he
had
exhibited
a
new
trait
that
tormented
princess
mary
more
than
anything
else
this
was
his
everincreasing
intimacy
with
mademoiselle
bourienne
.
the
idea
that
at
the
first
moment
of
receiving
the
news
of
his
sons
intentions
had
occurred
to
him
in
jest
that
if
andrew
got
married
he
himself
would
marry
bouri
enne
had
evidently
pleased
him
and
latterly
he
had
persistently
and
as
it
seemed
to
prin
cess
mary
merely
to
offend
her
shown
special
endearments
to
the
companion
and
expressed
his
dissatisfaction
with
his
daughter
by
demon
strations
of
love
of
bourienne
.
one
day
in
moscow
in
princess
marys
pres
ence
she
thought
her
father
did
it
purposely
when
she
was
there
the
old
prince
kissed
made
moiselle
bouriennes
hand
and
drawing
hereto
him
embraced
her
affectionately
.
princess
mary
flushed
and
ran
out
of
the
room
.
a
few
min
utes
later
mademoiselle
bourienne
came
into
princess
marys
room
smiling
and
making
cheerful
remarks
in
her
agreeable
voice
.
prin
cess
mary
hastily
wiped
away
her
tears
went
resolutely
up
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
evidently
unconscious
of
what
she
was
doing
began
shouting
in
angry
haste
at
the
frenchwoman
her
voice
breaking
its
horrible
vile
inhuman
to
take
advan
tage
of
the
weakness

.

.

.
she
did
not
finish
.
leave
my
room
she
exclaimed
and
burst
into
sobs
.
next
day
the
prince
did
not
say
a
word
to
his
daughter
but
she
noticed
that
at
dinner
he
gave
orders
that
mademoiselle
bourienne
should
be
served
first
.
after
dinner
when
the
footman
handed
coffee
and
from
habit
began
with
the
princess
the
prince
suddenly
grew
furious
threw
his
stick
at
philip
and
instantly
gave
instructions
to
have
him
conscripted
for
the
army
.
he
doesnt
obey

..
.
i
said
it
twice

.

.

.
and
he
doesnt
obey
she
is
the
first
person
in
this
house
shes
my
best
friend
cried
the
prince
.
and
if
you
allow
yourself
he
screamed
in
a
fury
addressing
princess
mary
for
the
first
time
to
forget
yourself
again
before
her
as
you
dared
to
do
yesterday
i
will
show
you
who
is
master
in
this
house
.
go
dont
let
me
set
eyes
on
you
beg
her
pardon
princess
mary
asked
mademoiselle
bouri
ennes
pardon
and
also
her
fathers
pardon
book
eight
for
herself
and
for
philip
the
footman
who
had
begged
for
her
intervention
.
at
such
moments
something
like
a
pride
of
sacrifice
gathered
in
her
soul
.
and
suddenly
that
father
whom
she
had
judged
would
look
for
his
spectacles
in
her
presence
fumbling
near
them
and
not
seeing
them
or
would
for
get
something
that
had
just
occurred
or
take
a
false
step
with
his
failing
legs
and
turn
to
see
if
anyone
had
noticed
his
feebleness
or
worst
of
all
at
dinner
when
there
were
no
visitors
to
excite
him
would
suddenly
fall
asleep
letting
his
napkin
drop
and
his
shaking
head
sink
over
his
plate
.
he
is
old
and
feeble
and
i
dare
to
condemn
him
she
thought
at
such
moments
with
a
feeling
of
revulsion
against
herself
.
chapter
iii
in
1811
there
was
living
in
moscow
a
french
doctor
me
tivier
who
had
rapidly
become
the
fashion
.
he
was
enormously
tall
handsome
amiable
as
frenchmen
are
and
was
as
all
mos
cow
said
an
extraordinarily
clever
doctor
.
he
was
received
in
the
best
houses
not
merely
as
a
doctor
but
as
an
equal
.
prince
nicholas
had
always
ridiculed
medi
cine
but
latterly
on
mademoiselle
bouriennes
advice
had
allowed
this
doctor
to
visit
him
and
had
grown
accustomed
to
him
.
metivier
came
to
see
the
prince
about
twice
a
week
.
on
december

st

nicholas
day
and
the
princes
name
day
all
moscow
came
to
the
princes
front
door
but
he
gave
orders
to
ad
mit
no
one
and
to
invite
to
dinner
only
a
small
number
a
list
of
whom
he
gave
to
princess
mary
.
mdtivier
who
came
in
the
morning
with
his
felicitations
considered
it
proper
in
his
quality
of
doctor
de
forcer
la
consigned
as
he
told
prin
cess
mary
and
went
in
to
see
the
prince
.
it
happened
that
on
that
morning
of
his
name
day
the
prince
was
in
one
of
his
worst
moods
.
he
had
been
going
about
the
house
all
the
morning
finding
fault
with
everyone
and
pre
tending
not
to
understand
what
was
said
to
him
and
not
to
be
understood
himself
.
prin
cess
mary
well
knew
this
mood
of
quiet
ab
sorbed
querulousness
which
generally
culmi
nated
in
a
burst
of
rage
and
she
went
about
all
that
morning
as
though
facing
a
cocked
and
loaded
gun
and
awaited
the
inevitable
explo
sion
.
until
the
doctors
arrival
the
morning
had
passed
off
safely
.
after
admitting
the
doc
tor
princess
mary
sat
down
with
a
book
in
the
1
to
force
the
guard
.
drawing
room
near
the
door
through
which
she
could
hear
all
that
passed
in
the
study
.
at
first
she
heard
only
me
tiviers
voice
then
her
fathers
then
both
voices
began
speaking
at
the
same
time
the
door
was
flung
open
and
on
the
threshold
appeared
the
handsome
figure
of
the
terrified
mehivierwith
his
shock
of
black
hair
and
the
prince
in
his
dressing
gown
and
fez
his
face
distorted
with
fury
and
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
rolled
downwards
.

shouted
the
prince
but

house

.

.
and
he
slammed
the
door
.
mdtivier
shrugging
his
shoulders
went
up
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
who
at
the
sound
of
shouting
had
run
in
from
an
adjoining
room
.
the
prince

not
very
well
bile
and
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
.
keep
calm
i
will
call
again
tomorrow
said
mdtivier
and
putting
his
fingers
to
his
lips
he
hastened
away
.
through
the
study
door
came
the
sound
of
slippered
feet
and
the
cry
spies
traitors
traitors
everywhere
not
a
moments
peace
in
my
own
house
after
metiviers
departure
the
old
prince
called
his
daughter
in
and
the
whole
weight
of
his
wrath
fell
on
her
.
she
was
to
blame
that
a
spy
had
been
admitted

not
told
her
yes
told
her
to
make
a
list
and
not
to
admit
anyone
who
was
not
on
that
list
then
why
was
that
scoundrel
admitted
she
was
the
cause
of
it
all
.
with
her
he
said
he
could
not
have
a
moments
peace
and
could
not
die
quietly
.
no
maam
we
must
part
we
must
part
understand
that
understand
it
i
cannot
en
dure
any
more
he
said
and
left
the
room
.
then
as
if
afraid
she
might
find
some
means
of
consolation
he
returned
and
trying
to
ap
pear
calm
added
and
dont
imagine
i
have
said
this
in
a
moment
of
anger
.
i
am
calm
i
have
thought
it
over
and
it
will
be
carried
out
we
must
part
so
find
some
place
for
your
self
i

.
but
he
could
not
restrain
himself
and
with
the
virulence
of
which
only
one
who
loves
is
capable
evidently
suffering
himself
he
shook
his
fists
at
her
and
screamed
if
only
some
fool
would
marry
her
then
he
slammed
the
door
sent
for
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
subsided
into
his
study
.
at
two
oclock
the
six
chosen
guests
assem
bled
for
dinner
.
these
guests
the
famous
count
rostop
chin
prince
lopukhfn
with
his
nephew
gen
eral
chatrov
an
old
war
comrade
of
the
princes
and
of
the
younger
generation
pierre
and
war
and
peace
boris
drubetsk6y
awaited
the
prince
in
the
drawing
room
.
boris
who
had
come
to
moscow
on
leave
a
few
days
before
had
been
anxious
to
be
pre
sented
to
prince
nicholas
bolk6nski
and
had
contrived
to
ingratiate
himself
so
well
that
the
old
prince
in
his
case
made
an
exception
to
the
rule
of
not
receiving
bachelors
in
his
house
.
the
princes
house
did
not
belong
to
what
is
known
as
fashionable
society
but
his
little
cir
clethough
not
much
talked
about
in
town
was
one
it
was
more
flattering
to
be
received
in
than
any
other
.
boris
had
realized
this
the
week
before
when
the
commander
in
chief
in
his
presence
invited
rostopchin
to
dinner
on
st
.
nicholas
day
and
rostopchin
had
replied
that
he
could
not
come
on
that
day
i
always
go
to
pay
my
devo
tions
to
the
relics
of
prince
nicholas
bolk6n
ski
.
oh
yes
yes
replied
the
commander
in
chief
.
how
is
he

.

.

.
the
small
group
that
assembled
before
din
ner
in
the
lofty
oldfashioned
drawing
room
with
its
old
furniture
resembled
the
solemn
gathering
of
a
court
of
justice
.
all
were
silent
or
talked
in
low
tones
.
prince
nicholas
came
in
serious
and
taciturn
.
princess
mary
seemed
even
quieter
and
more
diffident
than
usual
.
the
guests
were
reluctant
to
address
her
feel
ing
that
she
was
in
no
mood
for
their
conversa
tion
.
count
rostopchfn
alone
kept
the
con
versation
going
now
relating
the
latest
town
news
and
now
the
latest
political
gossip
.
lopukhin
and
the
old
general
occasionally
took
part
in
the
conversation
.
prince
bolk6n
ski
listened
as
a
presiding
judge
receives
a
re
port
only
now
and
then
silently
or
by
a
brief
word
showing
that
he
took
heed
of
what
was
being
reported
to
him
.
the
tone
of
the
con
versation
was
such
as
indicated
that
no
one
ap
proved
of
what
was
being
done
in
the
political
world
.
incidents
were
related
evidently
con
firming
the
opinion
that
everything
was
going
from
bad
to
worse
but
whether
telling
a
story
or
giving
an
opinion
the
speaker
always
stopped
or
was
stopped
at
the
point
beyond
which
his
criticism
might
touch
the
sovereign
himself
.
at
dinner
the
talk
turned
on
the
latest
politi
cal
news
napoleons
seizure
of
the
duke
of
oldenburgs
territory
and
the
russian
note
hostile
to
napoleon
which
had
been
sent
to
all
the
european
courts
.
bonaparte
treats
europe
as
a
pirate
does
a
captured
vessel

said
count
rostopchin
re
peating
a
phrase
he
had
uttered
several
times
before
.
one
only
wonders
at
the
longsuffer
ing
or
blindness
of
the
crowned
heads

now
the

turn
has
come
and
bonaparte
doesnt
scruple
to
depose

silent
our
sovereign
alone
has
protested
against
the
seizure
of

and
even

.

.
count
rostopchin
paused
feeling
that
he
had
reached
the
limit
beyond
which
censure
was
impossible
.
other
territories
have
been
offered
in
ex
change
for
the
duchy
of
oldenburg
said
prince
bolkonski
.
he
shifts
the
dukes
about
as
i
might
move
my
serfs
from
bald
hills
to
bogucharovo
or
my
ryazan
estates
.
the
duke
of
oldenburg
bears
his
misfor
tunes
with
admirable
strength
of
character
and
resignation
remarked
boris
joining
in
re
spectfully
.
he
said
this
because
on
his
journey
from
petersburg
he
had
had
the
honor
of
being
pre
sented
to
the
duke
.
prince
bolkonski
glanced
at
the
young
man
as
if
about
to
say
something
in
reply
but
changed
his
mind
evidently
con
sidering
him
too
young
.
i
have
read
our
protests
about
the
olden
burg
affair
and
was
surprised
how
badly
the
note
was
worded
remarked
count
rostop
chin
in
the
casual
tone
of
a
man
dealing
with
a
subject
quite
familiar
to
him
.
pierre
looked
at
rostopchfn
with
naive
as
tonishment
not
understanding
why
he
should
be
disturbed
by
the
bad
composition
of
the
note
.
does
it
matter
count
how
the
note
is
worded
he
asked
so
long
as
its
substance
is
forcible
my
clear
fellow
with
our
five
hundred
thou
sand
troops
it
should
be
easy
to
have
a
good
style
returned
count
rostopchin
.
pierre
now
understood
the
counts
dissatis
faction
with
the
wording
of
the
note
.
one
would
have
thought
quill
drivers
enough
had
sprung
up
remarked
the
old
prince
.
there
in
petersburg
they
are
always
writing
not
notes
only
but
even
new
laws
.
my
andrew
there
has
written
a
whole
volume
of
laws
for
russia
.
nowadays
they
are
always
writ
ing
and
he
laughed
unnaturally
.
there
was
a
momentary
pause
in
the
con
versation
the
old
general
cleared
his
throat
to
draw
attention
.
did
you
hear
of
the
last
event
at
the
review
in
petersburg
the
figure
cut
by
the
new
french
ambassador
book
eight
39
eh
yes
i
heard
something
he
said
some
thing
awkward
in
his
majestys
presence
.
his
majesty
drew
attention
to
the
grena
dier
division
and
to
the
march
past
continued
the
general
and
it
seems
the
ambassador
took
no
notice
and
allowed
himself
to
reply
that
we
in
france
pay
no
attention
to
such
trifles
the
emperor
did
not
condescend
to
reply
.
at
the
next
review
they
say
the
emperor
did
not
once
deign
to
address
him
.
all
were
silent
.
on
this
fact
relating
to
the
emperor
personally
it
was
impossible
to
pass
any
judgment
.
impudent
fellows
said
the
prince
.
you
know
mtivier
i
turned
him
out
of
my
house
this
morning
.
he
was
here
they
admitted
him
in
spite
of
my
request
that
they
should
let
no
one
in
he
went
on
glancing
angrily
at
his
daughter
.
and
he
narrated
his
whole
conversation
with
the
french
doctor
and
the
reasons
that
con
vinced
him
that
mtivier
was
a
spy
.
though
these
reasons
were
very
insufficient
and
ob
scure
no
one
made
any
rejoinder
.
after
the
roast
champagne
was
served
.
the
guests
rose
to
congratulate
the
old
prince
.
princess
mary
too
went
round
to
him
.
he
gave
her
a
cold
angry
look
and
offered
her
his
wrinkled
cleanshaven
cheek
to
kiss
.
the
whole
expression
of
his
face
told
her
that
he
had
not
forgotten
the
mornings
talk
that
his
decision
remained
in
force
and
only
the
presence
of
visitors
hindered
his
speaking
of
it
to
her
now
.
when
they
went
into
the
drawing
room
where
coffee
was
served
the
old
men
sat
to
gether
.
prince
nicholas
grew
more
animated
and
expressed
his
views
on
the
impending
war
.
he
said
that
our
wars
with
bonaparte
would
be
disastrous
so
long
as
we
sought
alliances
with
the
germans
and
thrust
ourselves
into
european
affairs
into
which
we
had
been
drawn
by
the
peace
of
tilsit
.
we
ought
not
to
fight
either
for
or
against
austria
.
our
po
litical
interests
are
all
in
the
east
and
in
re
gard
to
bonaparte
the
only
thing
is
to
have
an
armed
frontier
and
a
firm
policy
and
he
will
never
dare
to
cross
the
russian
frontier
as
was
the
case
in
1807
how
can
we
fight
the
french
prince
said
count
rostopchin
.
can
we
arm
ourselves
against
our
teachers
and
divinities
look
at
our
youths
look
at
our
ladiesl
the
french
are
our
gods
paris
is
our
kingdom
of
heaven
.
he
began
speaking
louder
evidently
to
be
heard
by
everyone
.
french
dresses
french
ideas
french
feel
ings
there
now
you
turned
mtivier
out
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
because
he
is
a
french
man
and
a
scoundrel
but
our
ladies
crawl
aft
er
him
on
their
knees
.
i
went
to
a
party
last
night
and
there
out
of
five
ladies
three
were
roman
catholics
and
had
the
popes
indul
gence
for
doing
woolwork
on
sundays
.
and
they
themselves
sit
there
nearly
naked
like
the
signboards
at
our
public
baths
if
i
may
say
so
.
ah
when
one
looks
at
our
young
people
prince
one
would
like
to
take
peter
the
greats
old
cudgel
out
of
the
museum
and
belabor
them
in
the
russian
way
till
all
the
nonsense
jumps
out
of
them
.
all
were
silent
.
the
old
prince
looked
at
ros
topchfn
with
a
smile
and
wagged
his
head
ap
provingly
.
well
goodby
your
excellency
keep
well
said
rostopchfn
getting
up
with
characteristic
briskness
and
holding
out
his
hand
to
the
prince
.
goodby
my
dear
fellow
his
words
are
music
i
never
tire
of
hearing
him
said
the
old
prince
keeping
hold
of
the
hand
and
of
fering
his
cheek
to
be
kissed
.
following
rostopchins
example
the
others
also
rose
.
chapter
iv
princess
mary
as
she
sat
listening
to
the
old
mens
talk
and
faultfinding
understood
noth
ing
of
what
she
heard
she
only
wondered
whether
the
guests
had
all
observed
her
fa
thers
hostile
attitude
toward
her
.
she
did
not
even
notice
the
special
attentions
and
amiabil
ities
shown
her
during
dinner
by
boris
drubet
sk6y
who
was
visiting
them
for
the
third
time
already
.
princess
mary
turned
with
an
absentminded
questioning
look
to
pierre
who
hat
in
hand
and
with
a
smile
on
his
face
was
the
last
of
the
guests
to
approach
her
after
the
old
prince
had
gone
out
and
they
were
left
alone
in
the
draw
ing
room
.
may
i
stay
a
little
longer
he
said
letting
his
stout
body
sink
into
an
armchair
beside
her
.
oh
yes
she
answered
.
you
noticed
noth
ing
her
look
asked
.
pierre
was
in
an
agreeable
afterdinner
mood
.
he
looked
straight
before
him
and
smiled
quietly
.
have
you
known
that
young
man
long
princess
he
asked
310
who
drubetsk6y
.
no
not
long
.

.

.

.
do
you
like
him
yes
he
is
an
agreeable
young
man
.

.

.

.
why
do
you
ask
me
that
said
princess
mary
still
thinking
of
that
mornings
conversation
with
her
father
.
because
i
have
noticed
that
when
a
young
man
comes
on
leave
from
petersburg
to
mos
cow
it
is
usually
with
the
object
of
marrying
an
heiress
.
you
have
observed
that
said
princess
mary
.
yes
returned
pierre
with
a
smile
and
this
young
man
now
manages
matters
so
that
where
there
is
a
wealthy
heiress
there
he
is
too
.
i
can
read
him
like
a
book
.
at
present
he
is
hesitating
whom
to
lay
siege
to
you
or
made
moiselle
julie
kardgina
.
he
is
very
attentive
to
her
.
he
visits
them
yes
very
often
.
and
do
you
know
the
new
way
of
courting
said
pierre
with
an
amused
smile
evidently
in
that
cheerful
mood
of
good
humored
raillery
for
which
he
so
often
re
proached
himself
in
his
diary
.
no
replied
princess
mary
.
to
please
moscow
girls
nowadays
one
has
to
be
melancholy
.
he
is
very
melancholy
with
mademoiselle
karigina
said
pierre
.
really
asked
princess
mary
looking
into
pierres
kindly
face
and
still
thinking
of
her
own
sorrow
.
it
would
be
a
relief
thought
she
if
i
ventured
to
confide
what
i
am
feeling
to
someone
.
i
should
like
to
tell
everything
to
pierre
.
he
is
kind
and
generous
.
it
would
be
a
relief
.
he
would
give
me
advice
.
would
you
marry
him
oh
my
god
count
there
are
moments
when
i
would
marry
anybodyl
she
cried
sud
denly
to
her
own
surprise
and
with
tears
in
her
voice
.
ah
how
bitter
it
is
to
love
someone
near
to
you
and
to
feel
that

.

.

.
she
went
on
in
a
trembling
voice
that
you
can
do
nothing
for
him
but
grieve
him
and
to
know
that
you
cannot
alter
this
.
then
there
is
only
one
thing
leftto
go
away
but
where
could
i
go
what
is
wrong
what
is
it
princess
but
without
finishing
what
she
was
saying
princess
mary
burst
into
tears
.
i
dont
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
today
.
dont
take
any
notice
forget
what
i
have
said
pierres
gaiety
vanished
completely
.
he
anx
iously
questioned
the
princess
asked
her
to
war
and
peace
speak
out
fully
and
confide
her
grief
to
him
but
she
only
repeated
that
she
begged
him
to
forget
what
she
had
said
that
she
did
not
re
member
what
she
had
said
and
that
she
had
no
trouble
except
the
one
he
knew
ofthat
prince
andrews
marriage
threatened
to
cause
a
rupture
between
father
and
son
.
have
you
any
news
of
the
rost6vs
she
asked
to
change
the
subject
.
i
was
told
they
are
coming
soon
.
i
am
also
expecting
andrew
any
day
.
i
should
like
them
to
meet
here
.
and
how
does
he
now
regard
the
matter
asked
pierre
referring
to
the
old
prince
.
princess
mary
shook
her
head
.
what
is
to
be
done
in
a
few
months
the
year
will
be
up
.
the
thing
is
impossible
.
i
on
ly
wish
i
could
spare
my
brother
the
first
mo
ments
.
i
wish
they
would
come
sooner
.
i
hope
to
be
friends
with
her
.
you
have
known
them
a
long
time
said
princess
mary
.
tell
me
honestly
the
whole
truth
what
sort
of
girl
is
she
and
what
do
you
think
of
her
the
real
truth
because
you
know
andrew
is
risking
so
much
doing
this
against
his
fathers
will
that
i
should
like
to
know
.

.

.

.
an
undefined
instinct
told
pierre
that
these
explanations
and
repeated
requests
to
be
told
the
whole
truth
expressed
illwill
on
the
prin
cess
part
toward
her
future
sisterinlaw
and
a
wish
that
he
should
disapprove
of
andrews
choice
but
in
reply
he
said
what
he
felt
rather
than
what
he
thought
.
i
dont
know
how
to
answer
your
ques
tion
he
said
blushing
without
knowing
why
.
i
really
dont
know
what
sort
of
girl
she
is
i
cant
analyze
her
at
all
.
she
is
enchanting
but
what
makes
her
so
i
dont
know
.
that
is
all
one
can
say
about
her
.
princess
mary
sighed
and
the
expression
on
her
face
said
yes
thats
what
i
expected
and
feared
.
is
she
clever
she
asked

book

v
boris
had
not
succeeded
in
making
a
wealthy
match
in
petersburg
so
with
the
same
object
in
view
he
came
to
moscow
.
there
he
wavered
between
the
two
richest
heiresses
julie
and
princess
mary
.
though
princess
mary
despite
her
plainness
seemed
to
him
more
attractive
than
julie
he
without
knowing
why
felt
awk
ward
about
paying
court
to
her
.
when
they
had
last
met
on
the
old
princes
name
day
she
had
answered
at
random
all
his
attempts
to
talk
sentimentally
evidently
not
listening
to
what
he
was
saying
.
julie
on
the
contrary
accepted
his
attentions
readily
though
in
a
manner
peculiar
to
her
self
.
she
was
twentyseven
.
after
the
death
of
her
brothers
she
had
become
very
wealthy
.
she
was
by
now
decidedly
plain
but
thought
herself
not
merely
as
goodlooking
as
before
but
even
far
more
attractive
.
she
was
confirmed
in
this
delusion
by
the
fact
that
she
had
become
a
very
wealthy
heiress
and
also
by
the
fact
that
the
older
she
grew
the
less
dangerous
she
be
came
to
men
and
the
more
freely
they
could
associate
with
her
and
avail
themselves
of
her
suppers
soirees
and
the
animated
company
that
assembled
at
her
house
without
incurring
any
obligation
.
a
man
who
would
have
been
afraid
ten
years
before
of
going
every
day
to
the
house
when
there
was
a
girl
of
seventeen
there
for
fear
of
compromising
her
and
com
mitting
himself
would
now
go
boldly
every
day
and
treat
her
not
as
a
marriageable
girl
but
as
a
sexless
acquaintance
.
that
winter
the
kardgins
house
was
the
most
agreeable
and
hospitable
in
moscow
.
in
addition
to
the
formal
evening
and
dinner
parties
a
large
company
chiefly
of
men
gath
ered
there
every
day
supping
at
midnight
and
staying
till
three
in
the
morning
.
julie
never
missed
a
ball
a
promenade
or
a
play
.
her
dresses
were
always
of
the
latest
fashion
.
but
in
spite
of
that
she
seemed
to
be
disillu
sioned
about
everything
and
told
everyone
that
she
did
not
believe
either
in
friendship
or
in
love
or
any
of
the
joys
of
life
and
expected
peace
only
yonder
.
she
adopted
the
tone
of
one
who
has
suffered
a
great
disappointment
like
a
girl
who
has
either
lost
the
man
she
loved
or
been
cruelly
deceived
by
him
.
though
noth
ing
of
the
kind
had
happened
to
her
she
was
regarded
in
that
light
and
had
even
herself
come
to
believe
that
she
had
suffered
much
in
life
.
this
melancholy
which
did
not
prevent
her
amusing
herself
did
not
hinder
the
young
people
who
came
to
her
house
from
passing
the
time
pleasantly
.
every
visitor
who
came
to
the
house
paid
his
tribute
to
the
melancholy
mood
of
the
hostess
and
then
amused
himself
with
society
gossip
dancing
intellectual
games
and
bouts
rimts
which
were
in
vogue
at
the
kardgins
.
only
a
few
of
these
young
men
among
them
boris
entered
more
deeply
into
julies
melancholy
and
with
these
she
had
pro
longed
conversations
in
private
on
the
vanity
of
all
worldly
things
and
to
them
she
showed
her
albums
filled
with
mournful
sketches
max
ims
and
verses
.
to
boris
julie
was
particularly
gracious
she
regretted
his
early
disillusionment
with
life
offered
him
such
consolation
of
friendship
as
she
who
had
herself
suffered
so
much
could
render
and
showed
him
her
album
.
boris
sketched
two
trees
in
the
album
and
wrote
rustic
trees
your
dark
branches
shed
gloom
and
melancholy
upon
me
.
on
another
page
he
drewa

and
wrote

.
ah

julia
said
this
was
charming
.
there
is
something
so
enchanting
in
the
smile
of
melancholy
she
said
to
boris
repeat
ing
word
for
word
a
passage
she
had
copied
from
a
book
.
it
is
a
ray
of
light
in
the
dark
ness
a
shade
between
sadness
and
despair
showing
the
possibility
of
consolation
.
in
reply
boris
wrote

boris

than

boris
looked
on
one
another
as
the
only
souls
who
understood
one
another
in
a
world
of
in
different
people
.
anna
mikhdylovna
who
often
visited
the
karigins
while
playing
cards
with
the
mother
made
careful
inquiries
as
to
julies
dowry
she
was
to
have
two
estates
in
pnza
and
the
niz
heg6rod
forests
.
anna
mikhdylovna
regarded
the
refined
sadness
that
united
her
son
to
the
wealthy
julie
with
emotion
and
resignation
to
the
divine
will
.
you
are
always
charming
and
melancholy
my
dear
julie
she
said
to
the
daughter
.
boris
says
his
soul
finds
repose
at
your
house
.
he
has
suffered
so
many
disappointments
and
is
so
sensitive
said
she
to
the
mother
.
ah
my
dear
i
cant
tell
you
how
fond
i
have
grown
of
julie
latterly
she
said
to
her
son
.
but
who
could
help
loving
her
she
is
an
angelic
be
ing
ah
boris
boris
she
paused
.
and
how
i
pity
her
mother
she
went
on
today
she
showed
me
her
accounts
and
letters
from
pen
za
they
have
enormous
estates
there
and
she
poor
thing
has
no
one
to
help
her
and
they
do
cheat
her
so
boris
smiled
almost
imperceptibly
while
lis
tening
to
his
mother
.
he
laughed
blandly
at
her
naive
diplomacy
but
listened
to
what
she
had
to
say
and
sometimes
questioned
her
care
fully
about
the
pnza
and
nizheg6rod
estates
.
julie
had
long
been
expecting
a
proposal
from
her
melancholy
adorer
and
was
ready
to
accept
it
but
some
secret
feeling
of
repulsion
for
her
for
her
passionate
desire
to
get
mar
ried
for
her
artificiality
and
a
feeling
of
horror
at
renouncing
the
possibility
of
real
love
still
restrained
boris
.
his
leave
was
expiring
.
he
spent
every
day
and
whole
days
at
the
kard
gins
and
every
day
on
thinking
the
matter
over
told
himself
that
he
would
propose
to
morrow
.
but
in
julies
presence
looking
at
her
red
face
and
chin
nearly
always
powdered
her
moist
eyes
and
her
expression
of
continual
readiness
to
pass
at
once
from
melancholy
to
an
unnatural
rapture
of
married
bliss
boris
could
not
utter
the
decisive
words
though
in
imagination
he
had
long
regarded
himself
as
the
possessor
of
those
penza
and
nizheg6rod
estates
and
had
apportioned
the
use
of
the
in
come
from
them
.
julie
saw
boris
indecision
and
sometimes
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
repulsive
to
him
but
her
feminine
selfdeception
immediately
supplied
her
with
consolation
and
she
told
herself
that
he
was
only
shy
from
love
.
her
melancholy
however
began
to
turn
to
irritability
and
not
long
be
fore
boris
departure
she
formed
a
definite
plan
of
action
.
just
as
boris
leave
of
absence
was
expiring
anatole
kuragin
made
his
appear
ance
in
moscow
and
of
course
in
the
kargins
drawing
room
and
julie
suddenly
abandon
ing
her
melancholy
became
cheerful
and
very
attentive
to
kurdgin
.
my
dear
said
anna
mikhdylovna
to
her
son
i
know
from
a
reliable
source
that
prince
vasili
has
sent
his
son
to
moscow
to
get
him
married
to
julie
.
i
am
so
fond
of
julie
that
i
should
be
sorry
for
her
.
what
do
you
think
of
it
my
dear
the
idea
of
being
made
a
fool
of
and
of
hav
ing
thrown
away
that
whole
month
of
arduous
melancholy
service
to
julie
and
of
seeing
all
the
revenue
from
the
penza
estates
which
he
had
already
mentally
apportioned
and
put
to
proper
use
fall
into
the
hands
of
another
and
especially
into
the
hands
of
that
idiot
anatole
pained
boris
.
he
drove
to
the
karagins
with
the
firm
intention
of
proposing
.
julie
met
him
in
a
gay
careless
manner
spoke
casually
of
how
she
had
enjoyed
yesterdays
ball
and
asked
when
he
was
leaving
.
though
boris
had
come
intentionally
to
speak
of
his
love
and
therefore
meant
to
be
tender
he
began
speaking
irrita
bly
of
feminine
inconstancy
of
how
easily
wom
en
can
turn
from
sadness
to
joy
and
how
their
moods
depend
solely
on
who
happens
to
be
paying
court
to
them
.
julie
was
offended
and
replied
that
it
was
true
that
a
woman
needs
variety
and
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
would
weary
anyone
.
then
i
should
advise
you

.

.

.
boris
began
wishing
to
sting
her
but
at
that
instant
the
galling
thought
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
have
to
leave
moscow
without
having
accom
plished
his
aim
and
have
vainly
wasted
his
ef
fortswhich
was
a
thing
he
never
allowed
to
happen
.
he
checked
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence
lowered
his
eyes
to
avoid
seeing
her
unpleasantly
irritated
and
irresolute
face
and
said
i
did
not
come
here
at
all
to
quarrel
with
you
.
on
the
contrary

.

.

.
he
glanced
at
her
to
make
sure
that
he
might
go
on
.
her
irritability
had
suddenly
quite
van
ished
and
her
anxious
imploring
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
with
greedy
expectation
.
i
can
always
arrange
so
as
not
to
see
her
often
thought
boris
.
the
affair
has
been
begun
and
must
be
finished
he
blushed
hotly
raised
his
eyes
to
hers
and
said
you
know
my
feelings
for
you
book

there
was
no
need
to
say
more
julies
face
shone
with
triumph
and
selfsatisfaction
but
she
forced
boris
to
say
all
that
is
said
on
such
occasions
that
he
loved
her
and
had
never
loved
any
other
woman
more
than
her
.
she
knew
that
for
the
pnza
estates
and
nizheg6
rod
forests
she
could
demand
this
and
she
re
ceived
what
she
demanded

the
affianced
couple
no

to

it
was

for

recovery

prince

any

the

of

to

while
he
was
in

could
not
be
missed
.
the
rostovs
moscow
house
had
not
been
heated
that
winter
and
as
they
had
come
only
for
a
short
time
and
the
countess
was
not
with
them
the
count
decided
to
stay
with
marya

who
had
long
been
pressing
her
hospi

on
them
.
late
one
evening
the
rostovs
four
sleighs
drove
into
marya
dmitrievnas
courtyard
in
the
old
konyusheny
street
.
marya
dmitrievna
lived
alone
.
she
had
already
married
off
her
daughter
and
her
sons
were
all
in
the
service
.
she
held
herself
as
erect
told
everyone
her
opinion
as
candidly
loudly
and
bluntly
as
ev
er
and
her
whole
bearing
seemed
a
reproach
to
others
for
any
weakness

or
tempta
tionthe

riotadmit
.
from
early
in
the
morning
wearing
a
dressing
jacket
she
attended
to
her
household
affairs
and
then
she
drove
out
on
holy
days
to
church
and
after
the
service
to
jails
and
prisons
on
affairs
of
which
she
never
spoke
to
anyone
.
on
ordinary
days
after
dressing
she
received
peti
tioners
of
various
classes
of
whom
there
were
always
some
.
then
she
had
dinner
a
substan
tial
and
appetizing
meal
at
which
there
were
always
three
or
four
guests
after
dinner
she
played
a
game
of
boston
and
at
night
she
had
the
newspapers
or
a
new
book
read
to
her
while
she
knitted
.
she
rarely
made
an
exception
and
went
out
to
pay
visits
and
then
only
to
the
most
important
persons
in
the
town
.
she
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
when
the
ros
t6vs
arrived
and
the
pulley
of
the
hall
door
squeaked
from
the
cold
as
it
let
in
the
rost6vs
and
their
servants
.
mdrya
dmitrievna
with
her
spectacles
hanging
down
on
her
nose
and
her
head
flung
back
stood
in
the
hall
doorway
looking
with
a
stern
grim
face
at
the
new
ar
rivals
.
one
might
have
thought
she
was
angry
with
the
travelers
and
would
immediately
turn
them
out
had
she
not
at
the
same
time
been
giving
careful
instructions
to
the
servants
for
the
accommodation
of
the
visitors
and
their
be
longings
.

said
pointing
to
the
portmanteaus
and
not
greeting
anyone
.

she
added
turning
to
sonya
and
in
dicating
by
this
french
greeting
her
slightly
contemptuous
though
affectionate
attitude
to
ward
her
.
when
they
came
in
to
tea
having
taken
off
their
outdoor
things
and
tidied
themselves
up
after
their
journey
marya
dmitrievna
kissed
them
all
in
due
order
.

have

it
was
high

she
said
giving
natasha
a
significant
look
.
the

that
later
on
she
added
glancing
at
s6nya
with
a
look
that
showed
she
did
not
want
to
speak
of
it
in
her
presence
.
now

she
said

said
mdrya
dmftrievna
touching
her
god
daughter
and
favorite
natasha
on
the
cheek
with
her
large
hand
.
next
morning
mdrya
dmftrievna
took
the
young
ladies
to
the
iberian
shrine
of
the
moth
er
of
god
and
to
madame
suppertroguct
who
was
so
afraid
of
mdrya
dmitrievna
that
she
always
let
her
have
costumes
at
a
loss
mere
ly
to
get
rid
of
her
.
mdrya
dmitrievna
ordered
almost
the
whole
trousseau
.
when
they
got
home
she
turned
every
body
out
of
the
room
ex
cept
natdsha
and
then
called
her
pet
to
her
armchair
.
well
now
well
talk
.
i
congratulate
you
on
your
betrothed
.
youve
hooked
a
fine
fellow
i
am
glad
for
your
sake
and
ive
known
him
since
he
was
so
high
.
she
held
her
hand
a
cou
ple
of
feet
from
the
ground
.
natdsha
blushed
happily
.
i
like
him
and
all
his
family
.
now
listen
you
know
that
old
prince
nicholas
much
dislikes
his
sons
marrying
.
the
old
fellows
crotchety
of
course
prince
andrew
is
not
a
child
and
can
shift
without
him
but
its
not
nice
to
enter
a
family
against
a
fathers
will
.
one
wants
to
do
it
peacefully
and
lovingly
.
youre
a
clever
girl
and
youll
know
how
to
manage
.
be
kind
and
use
your
wits
.
then
all
will
be
well
.
natdsha
remained
silent
from
shyness
mdrya
dmftrievna
supposed
but
really
because
she
disliked
anyone
interfering
in
what
touched
her
love
of
prince
andrew
which
seemed
to
her
so
apart
from
all
human
affairs
that
no
one
could
understand
it
.
she
loved
and
knew
prince
andrew
he
loved
her
only
and
was
to
come
one
of
these
days
and
take
her
.
she
wanted
nothing
more
.
you
see
i
have
known
him
a
long
time
and
am
also
fond
of
mary
your
future
sisterinlaw
.
husbands

she
has
asked
me
to
bring

together
.

and

natdsha
answered
reluctantly
.
chapter
vii
next
day
by
mdrya
dmf
trievnas
advice
count
rost6v
took
natdsha
to
call
on
prince
nicholas
bolk6nski
.
the
count
did
not
set
out
cheerful
ly
on
this
visit
at
heart
he
felt
afraid
.
he
well
remembered
the
last
interview
he
had
had
with
the
old
prince
at
the
time
of
the
enrollment
when
in
reply
to
ah
invitation
to
dinner
he
had
had
to
listen
to
an
angry
reprimand
for
not
having
provided
his
full
quota
of
men
.
na
tdsha
on
the
other
hand
having
put
on
her
best
gown
was
in
the
highest
spirits
.
they
cant
help
liking
me
she
thought
.
everybody
always
has
liked
me
and
i
am
so
willing
to
do
anything
they
wish
so
ready
to
be
fond
of
him
for
being
his
father
andof
her
for
being
his
sister
that
there
is
no
reason
for
them
not
to
like
me
.

.

.

.
they
drove
up
to
the
gloomy
old
house
on
the
vozdvfzhenka
and
entered
the
vestibule
.
well
the
lord
have
mercy
on
us
said
the
count
half
in
jest
half
in
earnest
but
natdsha
noticed
that
her
father
was
flurried
on
entering
the
anteroom
and
inquired
timidly
and
softly
whether
the
prince
and
princess
were
at
home
.
when
they
had
been
announced
a
perturba
tion
was
noticeable
among
the
servants
.
the
footman
who
had
gone
to
announce
them
was
stopped
by
another
in
the
large
hall
and
they
whispered
to
one
another
.
then
a
maidservant
ran
into
the
hall
and
hurriedly
said
something
mentioning
the
princess
.
at
last
an
old
cross
looking
footman
came
and
announced
to
the
rost6vs
that
the
prince
was
not
receiving
but
that
the
princess
begged
them
to
walk
up
.
the
first
person
who
came
to
meet
the
visitors
was
mademoiselle
bourienne
.
she
greeted
the
fa
ther
and
daughter
with
special
politeness
and
showed
them
to
the
princess
room
.
the
prin
cess
looking
excited
and
nervous
her
face
flushed
in
patches
ran
in
to
meet
the
visitors
treading
heavily
and
vainly
trying
to
appear
cordial
and
at
ease
.
from
the
first
glance
prin
cess
mary
did
not
like
natdsha
.
she
thought
her
too
fashionably
dressed
frivolously
gay
and
vain
.
she
did
not
at
all
realize
that
before
hav
ing
seen
her
future
sisterinlaw
she
was
prej
book
eight
udiced
against
her
by
involuntary
envy
of
her
beauty
youth
and
happiness
as
well
as
by
jealousy
of
her
brothers
love
for
her
.
apart
from
this
insuperable
antipathy
to
her
prin
cess
mary
was
agitated
just
then
because
on
the
rost6vs
being
announced
the
old
prince
had
shouted
that
he
did
not
wish
to
see
them
that
princess
mary
might
do
so
if
she
chose
but
they
were
not
to
be
admitted
to
him
.
she
had
decid
ed
to
receive
them
but
feared
lest
the
prince
might
at
any
moment
indulge
in
some
freak
as
he
seemed
much
upset
by
the
rost6vs
visit
.
there
my
dear
princess
ive
brought
you
my
songstress
said
the
count
bowing
and
looking
round
uneasily
as
if
afraid
the
old
prince
might
appear
.
i
am
so
glad
you
should
get
to
know
one
another

.

.

.
very
sorry
the
prince
is
still
ailing
and
after
a
few
more
common
place
remarks
he
rose
.
if
youll
allow
me
to
leave
my
natdsha
in
your
hands
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
princess
ill
drive
round
to
see
an
na
semenovnsft
its
quite
near
in
the
dogs
square
and
then
ill
come
back
for
her
.
the
count
had
devised
this
diplomatic
ruse
as
he
afterwards
told
his
daughter
to
give
the
future
sistersinlaw
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
one
another
freely
but
another
motive
was
to
avoid
the
danger
of
encountering
the
old
prince
of
whom
he
was
afraid
.
he
did
not
mention
this
to
his
daughter
but
natdsha
noticed
her
fathers
nervousness
and
anxiety
and
felt
mor
tified
by
it
.
she
blushed
for
him
grew
still
an
grier
at
having
blushed
and
looked
at
the
princess
with
a
bold
and
defiant
expression
which
said
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
anybody
.
the
princess
told
the
count
that
she
would
be
delighted
and
only
begged
him
to
stay
longer
at
anna
semenovnas
and
he
departed
.
despite
the
uneasy
glances
thrown
at
her
by
princess
mary
who
wished
to
have
a
teteatdte
with
natasha
mademoiselle
bourienne
re
mained
in
the
room
and
persistently
talked
about
moscow
amusements
and
theaters
.
na
tasha
felt
offended
by
the
hesitation
she
had
noticed
in
the
anteroom
by
her
fathers
nerv
ousness
and
by
the
unnatural
manner
of
the
princess
who
she
thought
was
making
a
fa
vor
of
receiving
her
and
so
everything
dis
pleased
her
.
she
did
not
like
princess
mary
whom
she
thought
very
plain
affected
and
dry
.
natdsha
suddenly
shrank
into
herself
and
invol
untarily
assumed
an
offhand
air
which
alien
ated
princess
mary
still
more
.
after
five
minutes
of
irksome
constrained
conversation
they
heard
the
sound
of
slippered
feet
rapidly
ap
proaching
.
princess
mary
looked
frightened
.
the
door
opened
and
the
old
prince
in
a
dress
ing
gown
and
a
white
nightcap
came
in
.
ah
madam
he
began
.
madam

if
i
am
not

..
.
i
beg
you
to
excuse
me
to
excuse

i
did

madam
.
god
is
my
witness
i
did
not
know
you
had
honored
us
with
a
visit
and
i
came
in
such
a
costume
only
to
see
my
daugh
ter
.
i
beg
you
to
excuse
me

..
.
god
is
my
wit
ness
i
didnt
know
he
repeated
stressing
the
word
god
so
unnaturally
and
so
unpleas
antly
that
princess
mary
stood
with
downcast
eyes
not
daring
to
look
either
at
her
father
or
at
natdsha
.
nor
did
the
latter
having
risen
and
curtsied
know
what
to
do
.
mademoiselle
bourienne
alone
smiled
agreeably
.
i
beg
you
to
excuse
me
excuse
me
god
is
my
witness
i
did
not
know
muttered
the
old
man
and
after
looking
natdsha
over
from
head
to
foot
he
went
out
.
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
the
first
to
re
cover
herself
after
this
apparition
arid
began
speaking
about
the
princes
indisposition
.
na
tdsha
and
princess
mary
looked
at
one
anoth
er
in
silence
and
the
longer
they
did
so
with
out
saying
what
they
wanted
to
say
the
greater
grew
their
antipathy
to
one
another
.
when
the
count
returned
natdsha
was
im
politely
pleased
and
hastened
to
get
away
at
that
moment
she
hated
the
stiff
elderly
prin
cess
who
could
place
her
in
such
an
embarrass
ing
position
and
had
spent
half
an
hour
with
her
without
once
mentioning
prince
andrew
.
i
couldnt
begin
talking
about
him
in
the
presence
of
that
frenchwoman
thought
na
tdsha
.
the
same
thought
was
meanwhile
tor
menting
princess
mary
.
she
knew
what
she
ought
to
have
said
to
natdsha
but
she
had
been
unable
to
say
it
because
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
in
the
way
and
because
with
out
knowing
why
she
felt
it
very
difficult
to
speak
of
the
marriage
.
when
the
count
was
al
ready
leaving
the
room
princess
mary
went
up
hurriedly
to
natdsha
took
her
by
the
hand
and
said
with
a
deep
sigh
wait
i
must

.

.

.
natdsha
glanced
at
her
ironically
without
knowing
why
.
dear
natalie
said
princess
mary
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
am
glad
my
brother
has
found
happiness
.

.

.

.
she
paused
feeling
that
she
was
not
telling
the
truth
.
natdsha
noticed
this
and
guessed
its
reason
.
i
think
princess
it
is
not
convenient
to
war
and
peace
speak
of
that
now
she
said
with
external
dig
nity
and
coldness
though
she
felt
the
tears
choking
her
.
what
have
i
said
and
what
have
i
done
thought
she
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
the
room
.
they
waited
a
long
time
for
natasha
to
come
to
dinner
that
day
.
she
sat
in
her
room
crying
like
a
child
blowing
her
nose
and
sobbing
.
s6n
ya
stood
beside
her
kissing
her
hair
.
natasha
what
is
it
about
she
asked
.
what
do
they
matter
to
you
it
will
all
pass
natdsha
.
but
if
you
only
knew
how
offensive
it
was

..
.
as
if
i

..
.
dont
talk
about
it
natasha
.
it
wasnt
your
fault
so
why
should
you
mind
kiss
me
said
s6nya
.
natasha
raised
her
head
and
kissing
her
friend
on
the
lips
pressed
her
wet
face
against
her
.
i
cant
tell
you
i
dont
know
.
no
ones
to
blame
said
natasha
its
my
fault
.
but
it
all
hurts
terribly
.
oh
why
doesnt
he
come

.

.

.
she
came
in
to
dinner
with
red
eyes
.
mrya
dmitrievna
who
knew
how
the
prince
had
re
ceived
the
rostovs
pretended
not
to
notice
how
upset
natasha
was
and
jested
resolutely
and
loudly
at
table
with
the
count
and
the
other
guests
.
chapter
viii
that
evening
the
rost6vs
went
to
the
opera
for
which
mdrya
dmitrievna
had
taken
a
box
.
natasha
did
not
want
to
go
but
could
not
re
fuse
marya
drnitrievnas
kind
offer
which
was
intended
expressly
for
her
.
when
she
came
ready
dressed
into
the
ballroom
to
await
her
father
and
looking
in
the
large
mirror
there
saw
that
she
was
pretty
very
pretty
she
felt
even
more
sad
but
it
was
a
sweet
tender
sad
ness
.
o
god
if
he
were
here
now
i
would
not
behave
as
i
did
then
but
differently
.
i
would
not
be
silly
and
afraid
of
things
i
would
sim
ply
embrace
him
cling
to
him
and
make
him
look
at
me
with
those
searching
inquiring
eyes
with
which
he
has
so
often
looked
at
me
and
then
i
would
make
him
laugh
as
he
used
to
laugh
.
and
his
eyes
how
i
see
those
eyes
thought
natasha
.
and
what
do
his
father
and
sister
matter
to
me
i
love
him
alone
him
him
with
that
face
and
those
eyes
with
his
smile
manly
and
yet
childlike
.

.

.

.
no
i
had
better
not
think
of
him
not
think
of
him
but
forget
him
quite
forget
him
for
the
present
.
i
cant
bear
this
waiting
and
i
shall
cry
in
a
minute
and
she
turned
away
from
the
glass
making
an
effort
not
to
cry
.
and
how
can
s6nya
love
nicholas
so
calmlyand
quietlyand
wait
so
long
and
so
patiently
thought
she
looking
at
s6n
ya
who
also
came
in
quite
ready
with
a
fan
in
her
hand
.
no
shes
altogether
different
.
i
cant
natasha
at
that
moment
felt
so
softened
and
tender
that
it
was
not
enough
for
her
to
love
and
know
she
was
beloved
she
wanted
now
at
once
to
embrace
the
man
she
loved
to
speak
and
hear
from
him
words
of
love
such
as
filled
her
heart
.
while
she
sat
in
the
carriage
beside
her
father
pensively
watching
the
lights
of
the
street
lamps
flickering
on
the
frozen
window
she
felt
still
sadder
and
more
in
love
and
for
got
where
she
was
going
and
with
whom
.
hav
ing
fallen
into
the
line
of
carriages
the
ros
tovs
carriage
drove
up
to
the
theater
its
wheels
squeaking
over
the
snow
.
natasha
and
s6nya
holding
up
their
dresses
jumped
out
quickly
.
the
count
got
out
helped
by
thefltaotmen
and
passing
among
men
and
women
who
were
en
tering
and
the
program
sellers
they
all
three
went
along
the
corridor
to
the
first
row
of
box
es
.
through
the
closed
doors
the
music
was
al
ready
audible
.
natasha

hair

.

.

.
whispered
s6nya
.
an
attendant
deferentially
and
quickly
slipped
before
the
ladies
and
opened
the
door
of
their
box
.
the
music
sounded
louder
and
through
the
door
rows
of
brightly
lit
boxes
in
which
ladies
sat
with
bare
arms
and
shoulders
and
noisy
stalls
brilliant
with
uniforms
glit
tered
before
their
eyes
.
a
lady
entering
the
next
box
shot
a
glance
of
feminine
envy
at
natasha
.
the
curtain
had
not
yet
risen
and
the
overture
was
being
played
.
natasha
smoothing
her
gown
went
in
with
s6nya
and
sat
down
scan
ning
the
brilliant
tiers
of
boxes
opposite
.
a
sen
sation
she
had
not
experienced
for
a
long
time
that
of
hundreds
of
eyes
looking
at
her
bare
arms
and
neck
suddenly
affected
her
both
agreeably
and
disagreeably
and
called
up
a
whole
crowd
of
memories
desires
and
emo
tions
associated
with
that
feeling
.
the
two
remarkably
pretty
girls
natasha
and
s6nya
with
count
rost6v
who
had
not
been
seen
in
moscow
for
a
long
time
attracted
gen
eral
attention
.
moreover
everybody
knew
vaguely
of
natashas
engagement
to
prince
an
drew
and
knew
that
the
rostovs
had
lived
in
the
country
ever
since
and
all
looked
with
cu
riosity
at
a
fiancee
who
was
making
one
of
the
best
matches
in
russia
.
natdshas
looks
as
everyone
told
her
had
book
eight
improved
in
the
country
and
that
evening
thanks
to
her
agitation
she
was
particularly
pretty
.
she
struck
those
who
saw
her
by
her
full
ness
of
life
and
beauty
combined
with
her
in
difference
to
everything
about
her
.
her
black
eyes
looked
at
the
crowd
without
seeking
any
one
and
her
delicate
arm
bare
to
above
the
el
bow
lay
on
the
velvet
edge
of
the
box
while
evidently
unconsciously
she
opened
and
closed
her
hand
in
time
to
the
music
crumpling
her
program
.

that

drubetskoy
has
proposed
oh
yes
i
heard
it
today
said
shinshin
coming
into
the
rostovs
box
.
natasha
looked
in
the
direction
in
which
her
fathers
eyes
were
turned
and
saw
julie
sitting
beside
her
mother
with
a
happy
look
on
her
face
and
a
string
of
pearls
round
her
thick
red
neckwhich
natiisha
knew
was
covered
with
powder
.
behind
them
wearing
a
smile
and
leaning
over
with
an
ear
to
julies
mouth
was
boris
handsome
smoothly
brushed
head
.
he
looked
at
the
rostrtvs
from
under
his
brows
and
said
something
smiling
to
his
betrothed
.
they
are
talking
about
us
about
me
and
him
thought
natasha
.
and
he
no
doubt
is
calming
her
jealousy
of
me
.
they
neednt
trou
ble
themselves
if
only
they
knew
how
little
i
am
concerned
about
any
of
them
.
behind
them
sat
anna
mikhaylovna
wearing
a
green
headdress
and
with
a
happy
look
of
res
ignation
to
the
will
of
god
on
her
face
.
their
box
was
pervaded
by
that
atmosphere
of
an
af
fianced
couple
which
natasha
knew
so
well
and
liked
so
much
.
she
turned
away
and
sud
denly
remembered
all
that
had
been
so
humil
iating
in
her
mornings
visit
.
what
right
has
he
not
to
wish
to
receive
me
into
his
family
oh
better
not
think
of
it
not
till
he
comes
back
she
told
herself
and
began
looking
at
the
faces
some
strange
and
some
familiar
in
the
stalls
.
in
the
front
in
the
very
center
leaning
back
against
the
orchestra
rail
stood
d61okhov
in
a
persian
dress
his
curly
hair
brushed
up
into
a
huge
shock
.
he
stood
in
full
view
of
the
audience
well
aware
that
he
was
attracting
everyones
attention
yet
as
much
at
ease
as
though
he
were
in
his
own
room
.
around
him
thronged
moscows
most
brilliant
young
men
whom
he
evidently
dom
inated
.
the
count
laughing
nudged
the
blushing
sonya
and
pointed
to
her
former
adorer
.
do
you
recognize
him
said
he
.
and
where
has
he
sprung
from
he
asked
turning
to
shinshin
.
didnt
he
vanish
somewhere
he
did
replied
shinshin
.
he
was
in
the
caucasus
and
ran
away
from
there
.
they
say
he
has
been
acting
as
minister
to
some
ruling
prince
in
persia
where
he
killed
the
shahs
brother
.
now
all
the
moscow
ladies
are
mad
about
him
its
d61okhov
the
persian
that
does
it
we
never
hear
a
word
but
d61okhov
is
men
tioned

d61o
khov
and
anatole
kurigin
have
turned
all
our
ladies
heads
.
a
tall
beautiful
woman
with
a
mass
of
plait
ed
hair
and
much
exposed
plump
white
shoul
ders
arid
neck
round
which
she
wore
a
double
string
of
large
pearls
entered
the
adjoining
box
rustling
her
heavy
silk
dress
and
took
a
long
time
settling
into
her
place
.
natdsha
involuntarily
gazed
at
that
neck
those
shoulders
and
pearls
and
coiffure
and
admired
the
beauty
of
the
shoulders
and
the
pearls
.
while
natdsha
was
fixing
her
gaze
on
her
for
the
second
time
the
lady
looked
round
and
meeting
the
counts
eyes
nodded
to
him
and
smiled
.
she
was
the
countess
beziikhova
pierres
wife
and
the
count
who
knew
every
one
in
society
leaned
over
and
spoke
to
her
.

you
been
here
long
countess

in
quired
.

.

yes
he
meant

answered
hlne
and
glanced
attentively
at
natdsha
.
count
rost6v
resumed
his
seat
.
handsome
isnt
she
he
whispered
to
na
tdsha
.
wonderful
answered
natdsha
.
shes
a
woman
one
could
easily
fall
in
love
with
.
just
then
the
last
chords
of
the
overture
were
heard
and
the
conductor
tapped
with
his
stick
.
some
latecomers
took
their
seats
in
the
stalls
and
the
curtain
rose
.
as
soon
as
it
rose
everyone
in
the
boxes
and
stalls
became
silent
and
all
the
men
old
and
young
in
uniform
and
evening
dress
and
all
the
women
with
gems
on
their
bare
flesh
turned
their
whole
attention
with
eager
curiosity
to
the
stage
.
natasha
too
began
to
look
at
it
.
war
and
peace
chapter
ix
the
floor
of
the
stage
consisted
of
smooth
boards
at
the
sides
was
some
painted
card
board
representing
trees
and
at
the
back
was
a
cloth
stretched
over
boards
.
in
the
center
of
the
stage
sat
some
girls
in
red
bodices
and
white
skirts
.
one
very
fat
girl
in
a
white
silk
dress
sat
apart
on
a
low
bench
to
the
back
of
which
a
piece
of
green
cardboard
was
glued
.
they
all
sang
something
.
when
they
had
finished
their
song
the
girl
in
white
went
up
to
the
prompt
ers
box
and
a
man
with
tight
silk
trousers
over
his
stout
legs
and
holding
a
plume
and
a
dag
ger
went
up
to
her
and
began
singing
waving
his
arms
about
.
first
the
man
in
the
tight
trousers
sang
alone
then
she
sang
then
they
both
paused
while
the
orchestra
played
and
the
man
fingered
the
hand
of
the
girl
in
white
obviously
awaiting
the
beat
to
start
singing
with
her
.
they
sang
together
and
everyone
in
the
theater
began
clapping
and
shouting
while
the
man
and
woman
on
the
stage
who
represented
lovers
began
smil
ing
spreading
out
their
arms
and
bowing
.
after
her
life
in
the
country
and
in
her
pres
ent
serious
mood
all
this
seemed
grotesque
and
amazing
to
natdsha
.
she
could
not
follow
the
opera
nor
even
listen
to
the
music
she
saw
on
ly
the
painted
cardboard
and
the
queerly
dressed
men
and
women
who
moved
spoke
and
sang
so
strangely
in
that
brilliant
light
.
she
knew
what
it
was
all
meant
to
represent
but
it
was
so
pretentiously
false
and
unnatural
that
she
first
felt
ashamed
for
the
actors
and
then
amused
at
them
.
she
looked
at
the
faces
of
the
audience
seeking
in
them
the
same
senseof
ridicule
and
perplexity
she
herself
experienced
but
they
all
seemed
attentive
to
what
was
hap
pening
on
the
stage
and
expressed
delight
which
to
natdsha
seemed
feigned
.
i
suppose
it
has
to
be
like
this
she
thought
.
she
kept
looking
round
in
turn
at
the
rows
of
pomaded
heads
in
the
stalls
and
then
at
the
seminude
women
in
the
boxes
especially
at
hlene
in
the
next
box
who
apparently
quite
unclothed
sat
with
a
quiet
tranquil
smile
not
taking
her
eyes
off
the
stage
.
and
feeling
the
bright
light
that
flooded
the
whole
place
and
the
warm
air
heated
by
the
crowd
natdsha
little
by
little
be
gan
to
pass
into
a
state
of
intoxication
she
had
not
experienced
for
a
long
while
.
she
did
not
realize
who
and
where
she
was
nor
what
was
going
on
before
her
.
as
she
looked
and
thought
the
strangest
fancies
unexpectedly
and
discon
nectedly
passed
through
her
mind
the
idea
oc
curred
to
her
of
jumping
onto
the
edge
of
the
box
and
singing
the
air
the
actress
was
singing
then
she
wished
to
touch
with
her
fan
an
old
gentleman
sitting
not
far
from
her
then
to
lean
over
to
hlene
and
tickle
her
.
at
a
moment
when
all
was
quiet
before
the
commencement
of
a
song
a
door
leading
to
the
stalls
on
the
side
nearest
the
rost6vs
box
creaked
and
the
steps
of
a
belated
arrival
were
heard
.
theres
kurdgin
whispered
shinshfn
.
countess
bezukhova
turned
smiling
to
the
new
comer
and
natdsha
following
the
direction
of
that
look
saw
an
exceptionally
handsome
ad
jutant
approaching
their
box
with
aselfassured
yet
courteous
bearing
.
this
was
anatole
kurd
gin
whom
she
had
seen
and
noticed
long
ago
at
the
ball
in
petersburg
.
he
was
now
in
an
adju
tants
uniform
with
one
epaulet
and
a
shoulder
knot
.
he
moved
with
a
restrained
swagger
which
would
have
been
ridiculous
had
he
not
been
so
goodlooking
and
had
his
handsome
face
not
worn
such
an
expression
of
good
humored
complacency
and
gaiety
.
though
the
performance
was
proceeding
he
walked
delib
erately
down
the
carpeted
gangway
his
sword
and
spurs
slightly
jingling
and
his
handsome
perfumed
head
held
high
.
having
looked
at
natdsha
he
approached
his
sister
laid
his
well
gloved
hand
on
the
edge
of
her
box
nodded
to
her
and
leaning
forward
asked
a
question
with
a
motion
toward
natdsha
.
mais
charmante
said
he
evidently
refer
ring
to
natdsha
who
did
not
exactly
hear
his
words
but
understood
them
from
the
move
ment
of
his
lips
.
then
he
took
his
place
in
the
first
row
of
the
stalls
and
sat
down
beside
d6
lokhov
nudging
with
his
elbow
in
a
friendly
and
offhand
way
that
d61okhov
whom
others
treated
so
fawningly
.
he
winked
at
him
gaily
smiled
and
rested
his
foot
against
the
orchestra
screen
.
how
like
the
brother
is
to
the
sister
re
marked
the
count
.
and
how
handsome
they
both
are
shinshin
lowering
his
voice
began
to
tell
the
count
of
some
intrigue
of
kurdginsin
mos
cow
and
natdsha
tried
to
overhear
it
just
be
cause
he
had
said
she
was
charmante
.
the
first
act
was
over
.
in
the
stalls
everyone
began
moving
about
going
out
and
coming
in
.
boris
came
to
the
rost6vs
box
received
their
congratulations
very
simply
and
raising
his
eyebrows
with
an
absentminded
smile
con
veyed
to
natdsha
and
sonya
his
fiancees
invi
tation
to
her
wedding
and
went
away
.
natdsha
with
a
gay
coquettish
smile
talked
to
him
and
congratulated
on
his
approaching
wedding
that
book
eight
same
boris
with
whom
she
had
formerly
been
in
love
.
in
the
state
of
intoxication
she
was
in
everything
seemed
simple
and
natural
.
the
scantily
clad
hlne
smiled
at
everyone
in
the
same
way
and
natasha
gave
boris
a
sim
ilar
smile
.
hdnes
box
was
filled
and
surrounded
from
the
stalls
by
the
most
distinguished
and
intel
lectual
men
who
seemed
to
vie
with
one
anoth
er
in
their
wish
to
let
everyone
see
that
they
knew
her
.
during
the
whole
of
that
entracte
kurdgin
stood
with
d61okhov
in
front
of
the
orchestra
partition
looking
at
the
rostovs
box
.
natasha
knew
he
was
talking
about
her
and
this
afford
ed
her
pleasure
.
she
even
turned
so
that
he
should
see
her
profile
in
what
she
thought
was
its
most
becoming
aspect
.
before
the
beginning
of
the
second
act
pierre
appeared
in
the
stalls
.
the
rostovs
had
not
seen
him
since
their
ar
rival
.
his
face
looked
sad
and
he
had
grown
still
stouter
since
natasha
last
saw
him
.
he
passed
up
to
the
front
rows
not
noticing
any
one
.
anatole
went
up
to
him
and
began
speak
ing
to
him
looking
at
and
indicating
the
ros
tovs
box
.
on
seeing
natasha
pierre
grew
ani
mated
and
hastily
passing
between
the
rows
came
toward
their
box
.
when
he
got
there
he
leaned
on
his
elbows
and
smiling
talked
to
her
for
a
long
time
.
while
conversing
with
pierre
natasha
heard
a
mans
voice
in
countess
beziik
hovas
box
and
something
told
her
it
was
kurd
gin
.
she
turned
and
their
eyes
met
.
almost
smiling
he
gazed
straight
into
her
eyes
with
such
an
enraptured
caressing
look
that
it
seemed
strange
to
be
so
near
him
to
look
at
him
like
that
to
be
so
sure
he
admired
her
and
not
to
be
acquainted
with
him
.
in
the
second
act
there
was
scenery
repre
senting
tombstones
and
there
was
a
round
hole
in
the
canvas
to
represent
the
moon
shades
were
raised
over
the
footlights
and
from
horns
and
contrabass
came
deep
notes
while
many
people
appeared
from
right
and
left
wearing
black
cloaks
and
holding
things
like
daggers
in
their
hands
.
they
began
waving
their
arms
.
then
some
other
people
ran
in
and
began
drag
ging
away
the
maiden
who
had
been
in
white
and
was
now
in
light
blue
.
they
did
not
drag
her
away
at
once
but
sang
with
her
for
a
long
time
and
then
at
last
dragged
her
off
and
be
hind
the
scenes
something
metallic
was
struck
three
times
and
everyone
knelt
down
and
sang
a
prayer
.
all
these
things
were
repeatedly
inter
rupted
by
the
enthusiastic
shouts
of
the
audi
ence
.

during
this
act
every
time
natasha
looked
toward
the
stalls
she
saw
anatole
kurdgin
with
an
arm
thrown
across
the
back
of
his
chair
star
ing
at
her
.
she
was
pleased
to
see
that
he
was
captivated
by
her
and
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
there
was
anything
wrong
in
it
.
when
the
second
act
was
over
countess
be
ziikhova
rose
turned
to
the
rost6vs
box
her
whole
bosom
completely
exposed
beckoned
the
old
count
with
a
gloved
finger
and
paying
no
attention
to
those
who
had
entered
her
box
began
talking
to
him
with
an
amiable
smile
.

she
.

nattlsha
rose
and
curtsied
to
the
splendid
countess
.
she
was
so
pleased
by
praise
from
this
brilliant
beauty
that
she
blushed
with
pleasure
.

it

not
ashamed
to

countess

quite
deserved
her
rep
utation
of
being
a
fascinating
woman

she
could
say
what
she
did
not

was

much
of

and
wanted
to
get
to
know

said
she
to
natasha
with
her
stereotyped
and
lovely
smile
.
i
had
heard
about

from
my

you
heard

ried

also
from

prince

bolk6nski
she
went
on
with
special
emphasis
implying
that
she
knew
of
his
relation
to
natasha
.
to
get
better
acquainted
she
asked
that
one
of
the
young
ladies
should
come
into
her
box
for
the
rest
of
the
performance
and
natdsha
moved
over
to
it
.
the
scene
of
the
third
act
represented
a
pal
ace
in
which
many
candles
were
burning
and
pictures
of
knights
with
short
beards
hung
on
the
walls
.
in
the
middle
stood
what
were
prob
ably
a
king
and
a
queen
.
the
king
waved
his
right
arm
and
evidently
nervous
sang
some
thing
badly
and
sat
down
on
a
crimson
throne
.
the
maiden
who
had
been
first
in
white
and
then
in
light
blue
now
wore
only
a
smock
and
stood
beside
the
throne
with
her
hair
down
.
she
sangsomething
mournfully
addressing
the

but
the

waved
his

men
and

with

came
in
from

and
began
dancing
all
together

then
the
violins
played
very
shrilly

one
of

with

began

and
striking

rapidly
against
the

.
in
the
stalls
everyone
clapped
and
shout
ed

then
one
of
the
men
went
into
a
corner
of
the
stage
.
the
cymbals
and
horns
in
the
orchestra
struck
up
more
loudly
and
this
man
with
bare
legs
jumped
very
high
and
waved
his
feet
about
very
rapidly
.
he
was

received
sixty
thousand

for

everybody
in

began

with

the
man
stopped
and
began
smiling
and
bowing
to
all
sides
.
then
other
men
and
women
danced
with
bare
legs
.
then
the
king
again
shouted
to
the
sound
of
music
and
they
all
began
singing
.
but
suddenly
a
storm
came
on

and

everyone
ran
off

dragging

dropped

chapter

during
the
entracte
a
whiff
of
cold
air
came
into
hlnes
box
the
door
opened
and
ana
tole
entered
stooping
and
trying
not
to
brush
against
anyone
.
let
me
introduce
my
brother
to
you
said
hlne
her
eyes
shifting
uneasily
from
na
tdsha
to
anatole
.
natdsha
turned
her
pretty
little
head
toward
the
elegant
young
officer
and
smiled
at
him
over
her
bare
shoulder
.
anatole
who
was
as
handsome
at
close
quarters
as
at
a
distance
sat
down
beside
her
and
told
her
he
had
long
wished
to
have
this
happinessever
since
the
naryshkins
ball
in
fact
at
which
he
had
had
the
wellremembered
pleasure
of
seeing
her
.
kurdgin
was
much
more
sensible
and
simple
with
women
than
among
men
.
he
talked
bold
ly
and
naturally
and
natasha
was
strangely
and
agreeably
struck
by
the
fact
that
there
was
nothing
formidable
in
this
man
about
whom
there
was
so
much
talk
but
that
on
the
con
trary
his
smile
was
most
naive
cheerful
and
goodnatured
.
kurdgin
asked
her
opinion
of
the
perform
ance
and
told
her
how
at
a
previous
perform
ance
semenova
had
fallen
down
on
the
stage
.
and
do
you
know
countess
he
said
sud
denly
addressing
her
as
an
old
familiar
ac
quaintance
we
are
getting
up
a
costume
tour
nament
you
ought
to
take
part
in
it
it
will
be
great
fun
.
we
shall
all
meet
at
the
kardginsl
please
come
no
really
eh
said
he
.
while
saying
this
he
never
removed
his
smil
ing
eyes
from
her
face
her
neck
and
her
bare
arms
.
natdsha
knew
for
certain
that
he
was
en
raptured
by
her
.
this
pleased
her
yet
his
pres
ence
made
her
feel
constrained
and
oppressed
.
when
she
was
not
looking
at
him
she
felt
that
he
was
looking
at
her
shoulders
and
she
involuntarily
caught
his
eye
so
that
he
should
look
into
hers
rather
than
this
.
but
looking
in
to
his
eyes
she
was
frightened
realizing
that
there
was
not
that
barrier
of
modesty
she
had
always
felt
between
herself
and
other
men
.
she
did
not
know
how
it
was
that
within
five
min
utes
she
had
come
to
feel
herself
terribly
near
to
this
man
.
when
she
turned
away
she
feared
he
might
seize
her
from
behind
by
her
bare
arm
and
kiss
her
on
the
neck
.
they
spoke
of
most
ordinary
things
yet
she
felt
that
they
were
clos
er
to
one
another
than
she
had
ever
been
to
any
man
.
natdsha
kept
turning
to
hdene
and
to
her
father
as
if
asking
what
it
all
meant
but
helene
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
a
general
and
did
not
answer
her
look
and
her
fathers
eyes
said
nothing
but
what
they
always
said
having
a
good
time
well
im
glad
of
it
during
one
of
these
moments
of
awkward
silence
when
anatoles
prominent
eyes
were
gazing
calmly
and
fixedly
at
her
natdsha
to
break
the
silence
asked
him
how
he
liked
mos
cow
.
she
asked
the
question
and
blushed
.
she
felt
all
the
time
that
by
talking
to
him
she
was
doing
something
improper
.
anatole
smiled
as
though
to
encourage
her
.
at
first
i
did
not
like
it
much
because
what

now

he
said

at

significantly
.

natdsha
did
not
understand
what
he
was
saying
any
more
than
he
did
himself
but
she
felt
that
his
incomprehensible
words
had
an
improper
intention
.
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
turned
away
as
if
she
had
not
heard
his
remark
.
but
as
soon
as
she
had
turned
away
she
felt
that
he
was
there
behind
so
close
behind
her
.
how
is
he
now
confused
angry
ought
i
to
put
it
right
she
asked
herself
and
she
could
not
refrain
from
turning
round
.
she
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
and
his
nearness
selfassurance
and
the
goodnatured
tenderness
of
his
smile
vanquished
her
.
she
smiled
just
as
he
was
doing
gazing
straight
into
his
eyes
.
and
again
she
felt
with
horror
that
no
barrier
lay
between
him
and
her
.
the
curtain
rose
again
.
anatole
left
the
box
serene
and
gay
.
natasha
went
back
to
her
fa
ther
in
the
other
box
now
quite
submissive
to
the
world
she
found
herself
in
.
all
that
was
going
on
before
her
now
seemed
quite
nat
ural
but
on
the
other
hand
all
her
previous
thoughts
of
her
betrothed
of
princess
mary
or
of
life
in
the
country
did
not
once
recur
to
her
mind
and
were
as
if
belonging
to
a
re
mote
past
.
in
the
fourth
act
there
was
some
sort
of
dev
il
who
sang
waving
his
arm
about
till
the
boards
were
withdrawn
from
under
him
and
he
disappeared
down
below
.
that
was
the
only
part
of
the
fourth
act
that
natasha
saw
.
she
felt
agitated
and
tormented
and
the
cause
of
this
was
kurdgin
whom
she
could
not
help
watching
.
as
they
were
leaving
the
theater
an
atole
came
up
to
them
called
their
carriage
and
helped
them
in
.
as
he
was
putting
na
tdsha
in
he
pressed
her
arm
above
the
elbow
.
agitated
and
flushed
she
turned
round
.
he
was
looking
at
her
with
glittering
eyes
smiling
ten
derly
.
only
after
she
had
reached
home
was
na
tasha
able
clearly
to
think
over
what
had
hap
pened
to
her
and
suddenly
remembering
prince
andrew
she
was
horrified
and
at
tea
to
which
all
had
sat
down
after
the
opera
she
gave
a
loud
exclamation
flushed
and
ran
out
of
the
room
.
o
god
i
am
lost
she
said
to
herself
.
how
could
i
let
him
she
sat
for
a
long
time
hiding
her
flushed
face
in
her
hands
trying
to
realize
what
had
happened
to
her
but
was
unable
ei
ther
to
understand
what
had
happened
or
what
she
felt
.
everything
seemed
dark
obscure
and
terrible
.
there
in
that
enormous
illuminated
theater
where
the
barelegged
duport
in
a
tin
seldecorated
jacket
jumped
about
to
the
music
on
wet
boards
and
young
girls
and
old
men
and
the
nearly
naked
hdene
with
her
proud
calm
smile
rapturously
cried
bravo
there
in
the
presence
of
that
hellene
it
had
all
seemed
clear
and
simple
but
now
alone
by
herself
it
was
incomprehensible
.
what
is
it
what
was
that
terror
i
felt
of
him
what
is
this
gnawing
of
conscience
i
am
feeling
now
she
thought
.
only
to
the
old
countess
at
night
in
bed
could
natasha
have
told
all
she
was
feeling
.
she
knew
that
s6nya
with
her
severe
and
sim
ple
views
would
cither
not
understand
it
at
all
or
would
be
horrified
at
such
a
confession
.
so
natdsha
tried
to
solve
what
was
torturing
her
by
herself
.
am
i
spoiled
for
andrews
love
or
notshe
asked
herself
and
with
soothing
irony
replied
what
a
fool
i
am
to
ask
that
what
did
hap
pen
to
me
nothing
i
have
clone
nothing
i
didnt
lead
him
on
at
all
.
nobody
will
know
and
i
shall
never
see
him
again
she
told
her
self
.
so
it
is
plain
that
nothing
has
happened
and
there
is
nothing
to
repent
of
and
andrew
can
love
me
still
.
but
why
still
o
god
why
isnt
he
here
natdsha
quieted
herself
for
a
moment
but
again
some
instinct
told
her
that
though
all
this
was
true
and
though
nothing
had
happened
yet
the
former
purity
of
her
love
for
prince
andrew
had
perished
.
and
again
in
imagination
she
went
over
her
whole
conversation
with
kuragin
and
again
saw
the
face
gestures
arid
tender
smile
of
that
bold
handsome
man
when
he
pressed
her
arm
.
chapter

anatole
kuragin
was

war
and
peace
as
shinshin
had
remarked
from
the
time
of
his
arrival
anatole
had
turned
the
heads
of
the
moscow
ladies
especially
by
the
fact
that
he
slighted
them
and
plainly
preferred
the
gyp
sy
girls
and
french
actresses
with
the
chief
of
whon
mademoiselle
george
he
was
said
to
be
on
intimate
relations
.
he
had
never
missed
a
carousal
at
danflovs
or
other
moscow
revel
ers
drank
whole
nights
through
outvying
ev
eryone
else
and
was
at
all
the
balls
and
parties
of
the
best
society
.
there
was
talk
of
his
in
trigues
with
some
of
the
ladies
and
he
flirted
with
a
few
of
them
at
the
balls
.
but
he
did
not
run
after
the
unmarried
girls
especially
the
rich
heiresses
who
were
most
of
them
plain
.
there
was
a
special
reason
for
this
as
he
had
got
married
two
years
beforea
fact
known
on
ly
to
his
most
intimate
friends
.
at
that
time
while
with
his
regiment
in
poland
a
polish
landowner
of
small
means
had
forced
him
to
marry
his
daughter
.
anatole
had
very
soon
abandoned
his
wife
and
for
a
payment
which
he
agreed
to
send
to
his
fatherinlaw
had
ar
ranged
to
be
free
to
pass
himself
off
as
a
bach
elor
.
anatole
was
always
con
tent
with
his
position
with
himself
and
with
others
.
he
was
instinc
tively
and
thoroughly
convinced
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
live
otherwise
than
as
he
did
and
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
done
any
thing
base
.
he
was
incapable
of
considering
how
his
actions
might
affect
others
or
what
the
consequences
of
this
or
that
action
of
his
might
be
.
he
was
convinced
that
as
a
duck
is
so
made
that
it
must
live
in
water
so
god
had
made
him
such
that
he
must
spend
thirty
thousand
rubles
a
year
and
always
occupy
a
prominent
position
in
society
.
he
believed
this
so
firmly
that
others
looking
at
him
were
persuaded
of
it
too
and
did
not
refuse
him
either
a
leading
place
in
society
or
money
which
he
borrowed
from
anyone
and
everyone
and
evidently
would
not
repay
.
he
was
not
a
gambler
at
any
rate
he
did
not
care
about
winning
.
he
was
not
vain
.
he
did
not
mind
what
people
thought
of
him
.
still
less
could
he
be
accused
of
ambition
.
more
than
once
he
had
vexed
his
father
by
spoiling
his
own
career
and
he
laughed
at
distinctions
of
all
kinds
.
he
was
not
mean
and
did
not
refuse
anyone
who
asked
of
him
.
all
he
cared
about
was
gaiety
and
women
and
as
according
to
his
ideas
there
was
nothing
dishonorable
in
these
tastes
and
he
was
incapable
of
considering
what
the
gratification
of
his
tastes
entailed
for
oth
ers
he
honestly
considered
himself
irreproach
able
sincerely
despised
rogues
and

who
had
reappeared
that
year
in
moscow
after
his
exile
and
his
persian

tures
and
was
leading
a
life
of
luxury
gam
bling
and
dissipation
associated
with
his
old
petersburg
comrade
kurdgin
and
made
use
of
him
for
his
own
ends
.
anatole
was
sincerely
fond
of
d61okhov
for
his
cleverness
and
audacity
.
d61okhov
who
needed
anatole
kurdgins
name
position
and
connections
as
a
bait
to
draw
rich
young
men
into
his
gambling
set
made
use
of
him
and
amused
himself
at
his
expense
without
letting
the
other
feel
it
.
apart
from
the
advantage
he
derived
from
anatole
the
very
process
of
dominating
anothers
will
was
in
itself
a
pleas
ure
a
habit
and
a
necessity
to
d61okhov
.
natdsha
had
made
a
strong
impression
on
kurdgin
.
at
supper
after
the
opera
he
described
to
d61okhov
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
the
attractions
of
her
arms
shoulders
feet
and
hair
and
expressed
his
intention
of
making
love
to
her
.
anatole
had
no
notion
and
was
in
capable
of
considering
what
might
come
of
such
lovemaking
as
he
never
had
any
notion
of
the
outcome
of
any
of
his
actions

chapter
xii
the
day
after
the
opera
the
rost6vs
went
nowhere
and
nobody
came
to
see
them
.
mrya
dmitrievna
talked
to
the
count
about
some
thing
which
they
concealed
from
natasha
.
na
tdsha
guessed
they
were
talking
about
the
old
prince
and
planning
something
and
this
dis
quieted
and
offended
her
.
she
was
expecting
prince
andrew
any
moment
and
twice
that
book
eight
323
day
sent
a
manservant
to
the
vozdvizhenka
to
ascertain
whether
he
had
come
.
he
had
not
ar
rived
.
she
suffered
more
now
than
during
her
first
days
in
moscow
.
to
her
impatience
and
pining
for
him
were
now
added
the
unpleas
ant
recollection
of
her
interview
with
princess
mary
and
the
old
prince
and
a
fear
and
anxi
ety
of
which
she
did
not
understand
the
cause
.
she
continually
fancied
that
either
he
would
never
come
or
that
something
would
happen
to
her
before
he
came
.
she
could
no
longer
think
of
him
by
herself
calmly
and
continuous
ly
as
she
had
done
before
.
as
soon
as
she
be
gan
to
think
of
him
the
recollection
of
the
old
prince
of
princess
mary
of
the
theater
and
of
kurdgin
mingled
with
her
thoughts
.
the
question
again
presented
itself
whether
she
was
not
guilty
whether
she
had
not
already
broken
faith
with
prince
andrew
and
again
she
found
herself
recalling
to
the
minutest
de
tail
every
word
every
gesture
and
every
shade
in
the
play
of
expression
on
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
been
able
to
arouse
in
her
such
an
incomprehensible
and
terrifying
feeling
.
to
the
family
natasha
seemed
livelier
than
usual
but
she
was
far
less
tranquil
and
happy
than
before
.
on
sunday
morning
mdrya
dmitrievna
in
vited
her
visitors
to
mass
at
her
parish
church
the
church
of
the
assumption
built
over
the
graves
of
victims
of
the
plague
.
i
dont
like
those
fashionable
churches
she
said
evidently
priding
herself
on
her
in
dependence
of
thought
.
god
is
the
same
every
where
.
we
have
an
excellent
priest
he
con
ducts
the
service
decently
and
with
dignity
and
the
deacon
is
the
same
.
what
holiness
is
there
in
giving
concerts
in
the
choir
i
dont
like
it
its
just
selfindulgence
mdrya
dmftrievna
liked
sundays
and
knew
how
to
keep
them
.
her
whole
house
was
scrubbed
and
cleaned
on
saturdays
neither
she
nor
the
servants
worked
and
they
all
wore
holiday
dress
and
went
to
church
.
at
her
table
there
were
extra
dishes
at
dinner
and
the
serv
ants
had
vodka
and
roast
goose
or
suckling
pig
.
but
in
nothing
in
the
house
was
the
holiday
so
noticeable
as
in
mdrya
dmitrievnas
broad
stern
face
which
on
that
day
wore
an
invari
able
look
of
solemn
festivity
.
after
mass
when
they
had
finished
their
coffee
in
the
dining
room
where
the
loose
cov
ers
had
been
removed
from
the
furniture
a
servant
announced
that
the
carriage
was
ready
and
mdrya
dmftrievna
rose
with
a
stern
air
.
she
wore
her
holiday
shawl
in
which
she
paid
calls
and
announced
that
she
was
going
to
see
prince
nicholas
bolk6nski
to
have
an
explana
tion
with
him
about
natdsha
.
after
she
had
gone
a
dressmaker
from
ma
dame
suppertroguet
waited
on
the
rost6vs
and
natdsha
very
glad
of
this
diversion
hav
ing
shut
herself
into
a
room
adjoining
the
drawing
room
occupied
herself
trying
on
the
new
dresses
.
just
as
she
had
put
on
a
bodice
without
sleeves
and
only
tacked
together
and
was
turning
her
head
to
see
in
the
glass
how
the
back
fitted
she
heard
in
the
drawing
room
the
animated
sounds
of
her
fathers
voice
and
anothers
a
womans
that
made
her
flush
.
it
was
hlne
.
natdsha
had
not
time
to
take
off
the
bodice
before
the
door
opened
and
count
ess
beziikhova
dressed
in
a
purple
velvet
gown
with
a
high
collar
came
into
the
room
beam
ing
with
goodhumored
amiable
smiles
.
oh
my
enchantress
i
she
cried
to
the
blush
ing
natdsha
.
charming
no
this
is
really
be
yond
anything
my
dear
count
said
she
to
count
rostov
who
had
followed
her
in
.
how
can
you
live
in
moscow
and
go
nowhere
no
i
wont
let
you
off
mademoiselle
george
will
recite
at
my
house
tonight
and
therell
be
some
people
and
if
you
dont
bring
your
lovely
girls
who
are
prettier
than
mademoiselle
george
i
wont
know
you
my
husband
is
away
in
tver
or
i
would
send
him
to
fetch
you
.
you
must
come
.
you
positively
must
between
eight
and
nine
.
she
nodded
to
the
dressmaker
whom
she
knew
and
who
had
curtsied
respectfully
to
her
and
seated
herself
in
an
armchair
beside
the
looking
glass
draping
the
folds
of
her
velvet
dress
picturesquely
.
she
did
not
cease
chatter
ing
goodnaturedly
and
gaily
continually
prais
ing
natdshas
beauty
.
she
looked
at
natashas
dresses
and
praised
them
as
well
as
a
new
dress
of
her
own
made
of
metallic
gauze
which
she
had
received
from
paris
and
advised
na
tdsha
to
have
one
like
it
.
but
anything
suits
you
my
charmer
she
remarked
.
a
smile
of
pleasure
never
left
natdshas
face
.
she
felt
happy
and
as
if
she
were
blossoming
under
the
praise
of
this
dear
countess
beziik
hova
who
had
formerly
seemed
to
her
so
unap
proachable
and
important
and
was
now
so
kind
to
her
.
natdsha
brightened
up
and
felt
al
most
in
love
with
this
woman
who
was
so
beautiful
and
so
kind
.
hdene
for
her
part
was
sincerely
delighted
with
natdsha
and
wished
to
give
her
a
good
time
.
anatole
had
asked
her
to
bring
him
and
natdsha
together
and
she
34
war
and
peace
was
calling
on
the
rost6vs
for
that
purpose
.
the
idea
of
throwing
her
brother
and
natasha
together
amused
her
.
though
at
one
time
in
petersburg
she
had
been
annoyed
with
natdsha
for
drawing
boris
away
she
did
not
think
of
that
now
and
in
her
own
way
heartily
wished
natdsha
well
.
as
she
was
leaving
the
rost6vs
she
called
her
protegee
aside
.
my
brother
dined
with
me
yesterdaywe
nearly
died
of
laughter
he
ate
nothing
and
kept
sighing
for
you
my
charmer
he
is
madly
quite
madly
in
love
with
you
my
dear
.
natdsha
blushed
scarlet
when
she
heard
this
.
how
she
blushes
how
she
blushes
my
pret
ty
said
helene
.
you
must
certainly
come
.
if
you
love
somebody
my
charmer
that
is
not
a
reason
to
shut
yourself
up
.
even
if
you
are
en
gaged
i
am
sure
your
fiance
would
wish
you
to
go
into
society
rather
than
be
bored
to
death
.
so
she
knows
i
am
engaged
and
she
and
her
husband
pierrethat
good
pierre
have
talked
and
laughed
about
this
.
so
its
all
right
.
and
again
under
helenes
influence
what
had
seemed
terrible
now
seemed
simple
and
natural
.
and
she
is
such
a
grande
dame
so
kind
and
evidently
likes
me
so
much
.
and
why
not
enjoy
myself
thought
natdsha
gazing
at
hellene
with
wideopen
wondering
eyes
.
mdrya
dmitrievna
came
back
to
dinner
taci
turn
and
serious
having
evidently
suffered
a
defeat
at
the
old
princes
.
she
was
still
too
agi
tated
by
the
encounter
to
be
able
to
talk
of
the
affair
calmly
.
in
answer
to
the
counts
inquiries
she
replied
that
things
were
all
right
and
that
she
would
tell
about
it
next
day
.
on
hearing
of
countess
bezukhovas
visit
and
the
invitation
for
that
evening
mdrya
dmftrievna
remarked
i
dont
care
to
have
anything
to
do
with
bezukhova
and
dont
advise
you
to
however
if
youve
promised
go
.
it
will
divert
your
thoughts
she
added
addressing
natdsha
.
chapter
xiii
count
rostov
took
the
girls
to
countess
be
zukhovas
.
there
were
a
good
many
people
there
but
nearly
all
strangers
to
natdsha
.
count
rost6v
was
displeased
to
see
that
the
company
consisted
almost
entirely
of
men
and
women
known
for
the
freedom
of
their
con
duct
.
mademoiselle
george
was
standing
in
a
corner
of
the
drawing
room
surrounded
by
young
men
.
there
were
several
frenchmen
present
among
them
mdtivier
who
from
the
time
helene
reached
moscow
had
been
an
inti
mate
in
her
house
.
the
count
decided
not
to
sit
down
to
cards
or
let
his
girls
out
of
his
sight
and
to
get
away
as
soon
as
mademoiselle
georges
performance
was
over
.
anatole
was
at
the
door
evidently
on
the
lookout
for
the
rost6vs
.
immediately
after
greeting
the
count
he
went
up
to
natdsha
and
followed
her
.
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
she
was
seized
by
the
same
feeling
she
had
had
at
the
opera
gratified
vanity
at
his
admiration
of
her
and
fear
at
the
absence
of
a
moral
barrier
be
tween
them
.
helene
welcomed
natdsha
delightedly
and
was
loud
in
admiration
of
her
beauty
and
her
dress
.
soon
after
their
arrival
mademoiselle
george
went
out
of
the
room
to
change
her
costume
.
in
the
drawing
room
people
began
arranging
the
chairs
and
taking
their
seats
.
anatole
moved
a
chair
for
natdsha
and
was
about
to
sit
down
beside
her
but
the
count
who
never
lost
sight
of
her
took
the
seat
him
self
.
anatole
sat
down
behind
her
.
mademoiselle
george
with
her
bare
fat
dimpled
arms
and
a
red
shawl
draped
over
one
shoulder
came
into
the
space
left
vacant
for
her
and
assumed
an
unnatural
pose
.
en
thusiastic
whispering
was
audible
.
mademoiselle
george
looked
sternly
and
gloomily
at
the
audience
and
began
reciting
some
french
verses
describing
her
guilty
love
for
her
son
.
in
some
places
she
raised
her
voice
in
others
she
whispered
lifting
her
head
tri
umphantly
sometimes
she
paused
and
uttered
hoarse
sounds
rolling
her
eyes
.
adorable
divine
delicious
was
heard
from
every
side
.
natasha
looked
at
the
fat
actress
but
neither
saw
nor
heard
nor
understood
anything
of
what
went
on
before
her
.
she
only
felt
herself
again
completely
borne
away
into
this
strange
senseless
world
so
remote
from
her
old
world
a
world
in
which
it
was
impossible
to
know
what
was
good
or
bad
reasonable
or
senseless
.
behind
her
sat
anatole
and
conscious
of
his
proximity
she
experienced
a
frightened
sense
of
expectancy
.
after
the
first
monologue
the
whole
com
pany
rose
and
surrounded
mademoiselle
george
expressing
their
enthusiasm
.
how
beautiful
she
is
natdsha
remarked
to
her
father
who
had
also
risen
and
was
mov
ing
through
the
crowd
toward
the
actress
.
i
dont
think
so
when
i
look
at
youl
said
anatole
following
natdsha
.
he
said
this
at
a
moment
when
she
alone
could
hear
him
.
you
are
enchanting

.

.

.
from
the
moment
i
saw
you
i
have
never
ceased

.

said
the
count
as
he
turned
back
for
his
daughter
.
how
beau
tiful
she
isl
natasha
without
saying
anything
stepped
up
to
her
father
and
looked
at
him
with
surprised
inquiring
eyes
.
after
giving
several
recitations
mademoi
selle
george
left
and
countess
beziikhova
asked
her
visitors
into
the
ballroom
.
the
count
wished
to
go
home
but
helene
entreated
him
not
to
spoil
her
improvised
ball
and
the
rostovs
stayed
on
.
anatole
asked
na
tasha
for
a
valse
and
as
they
danced
he
pressed
her
waist
and
hand
and
told
her
she
was
be
witching
and
that
he
loved
her
.
during
the
ccossaise
which
she
also
danced
with
him
an
atole
said
nothing
when
they
happened
to
be
by
themselves
but
merely
gazed
at
her
.
nata

lifted
her
frightened
eyes
to
him
but
there
was
such
confident
tenderness
in
his
affection
ate
look
and
smile
that
she
could
not
whilst
looking
at
him
say
what
she
had
to
say
.
she
lowered
her
eyes
.
dont
say
such
things
to
me
.
i
am
betrothed
and
love
another
she
said
rapidly
.

.

.

.
she
glanced
at
him
.
anatole
was
not
upset
or
pained
by
what
she
had
said
.
dont
speak
to
me
of
that
what
can
i
do
said
he
.
i
tell
you
i
am
madly

in

with

it
my
fault
that
you

.

.
its
our
turn
to
begin
.
natdsha
animated
and
excited
looked
about
her
with
wideopen
frightened
eyes
and
seemed
merrier
than
usual
.
she
understood
hardly
anything
that
went
on
that
evening
.
they
danced
the
ecossaise
and
the
grossvater
her
father
asked
her
to
come
home
but
she
begged
to
remain
.
wherever
she
went
and
whomever
she
was
speaking
to
she
felt
his
eyes
upon
her
.
later
on
she
recalled
how
she
had
asked
her
father
to
let
her
go
to
the
dressing
room
to
rearrange
her
dress
that
hlene
had
followed
her
and
spoken
laughingly
of
her
brothers
love
and
that
she
again
met
anatole
in
the
little
sitting
room
.
hlene
had
disap
peared
leaving
them
alone
and
anatole
had
taken
her
hand
and
said
in
a
tender
voice
i
cannot
come
to
visit
you
but
is
it
possible
that
i
shall
never
see
you
i
love
you
madly
.
can
i
never

.

.

.

and
blocking
her
path
he
brought
his
face
close
to
hers
.
his
large
glittering
masculine
eyes
were
so
close
to
hers
that
she
saw
nothing
but
them
.
natalie
he
whispered
inquiringly
while
she
felt
her
hands
being
painfully
pressed
.
natalie
i
dont
understand
.
i
have
nothing
to
say
her
eyes
replied
.
burning
lips
were
pressed
to
hers
and
at
the
same
instant
she
felt
herself
released
and
hlnes
footsteps
and
the
rustle
of
her
dress
were
heard
in
the
room
.
natasha
looked
round
at
her
and
then
red
and
trembling
threw
a
frightened
look
of
inquiry
at
anatole
and
moved
toward
the
door
.
one
word
just
one
for
gods
sake
cried
anatole
.
she
paused
.
she
so
wanted
a
word
from
him
that
would
explain
to
her
what
had
happened
and
to
which
she
could
find
no
answer
.
natalie
just
a
word
only
one
he
kept
re
peating
evidently
not
knowing
what
to
say
and
he
repeated
it
till
hlene
came
up
to
them
.
helenc
returned
with
natdsha
to
the
draw
ing
room
.
the
rostovs
went
away
without
staying
for
supper
.
after
reaching
home
natasha
did
not
sleep
all
night
.
she
was
tormented
by
the
insoluble
question
whether
she
loved
anatole
or
prince
andrew
.
she
loved
prince
andrew
she
re
membered
distinctly
how
deeply
she
loved
him
.
but
she
also
loved
anatole
of
that
there
was
no
doubt
.
else
how
could
all
this
have
hap
pened
thought
she
.
if
after
that
i
could
re
turn
his
smile
when
saying
goodby
if
i
was
able
to
let
it
come
to
that
it
means
that
i
loved
him
from
the
first
.
it
means
that
he
is
kind
noble
and
splendid
and
i
could
not
help
lov
ing
him
.
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
love
him
and
the
other
one
too
she
asked
herself
unable
to
find
an
answer
to
these
terrible
questions
.
chapter
xiv
morning
came
with
its
cares
and
bustle
.
every
one
got
up
and
began
to
move
about
and
talk
dressmakers
came
again
.
mdrya
dmitrievna
appeared
and
they
were
called
to
breakfast
.
natasha
kept
looking
uneasily
at
everybody
with
wideopen
eyes
as
if
wishing
to
intercept
every
glance
directed
toward
her
and
tried
to
appear
the
same
as
usual
.
after
breakfast
which
was
her
best
time
mdrya
dmitrievna
sat
down
in
her
armchair
and
called
natdsha
and
the
count
to
her
.
well
friends
i
have
now
thought
the
whole
matter
over
and
this
is
my
advice
she
began
.
yesterday
as
you
know
i
went
to
see
prince
bolk6nski
.
well
i
had
a
talk
with
him
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
begin
shouting
but
i
am
not
one
to
be
shouted
down
.
i
said
what
i
had
to
say
36
war
and
peace
well
and
he
asked
the
count
.
he
hes
crazy

..
.
he
did
not
want
to
listen
.
but
whats
the
use
of
talking
as
it
is
we
have
worn
the
poor
girl
out
said
mrya
dmf
triev
na
.
my
advice
to
you
is
finish
your
business
and
go
back
home
to
otrddnoe

.

.

.
and
wait
there
.
oh
no
exclaimed
natasha
.
yes
go
back
said
mrya
dmftrievnaand
wait
there
.
if
your
betrothed
comes
here
now
there
will
be
no
avoiding
a
quarrel
but
alone
with
the
old
man
he
will
talk
things
over
and
then
come
on
to
you
.
count
rost6v
approved
of
this
suggestion
appreciating
its
reasonableness
.
if
the
old
man
came
round
it
would
be
all
the
better
to
visit
him
in
moscow
or
at
bald
hills
later
on
and
if
not
the
wedding
against
his
wishes
could
only
be
arranged
at
otrddnoe
.
that
is
perfectly
true
.
and
i
am
sorry
i
went
to
see
him
and
took
her
said
the
old
count
.
no
why
be
sorry
being
here
you
had
to
pay
your
respects
.
but
if
he
wont
thats
his
affair
said
mrya
dmhrievna
looking
for
something
in
her
reticule
.
besides
the
trous
seau
is
ready
so
there
is
nothing
to
wait
for
and
what
is
not
ready
ill
send
after
you
.
though
i
dont
like
letting
you
go
it
is
the
best
way
.
so
go
with
gods
blessing
having
found
what
she
was
looking
for
in
the
reticule
she
handed
it
to
natasha
.
it
was
a
letter
from
princess
mary
.
she
has
written
to
you
.
how
she
torments
herself
poor
thing
shes
afraid
you
might
think
that
she
does
not
like
you
.
but
she
doesnt
like
me
said
natasha
.
dont
talk
nonsense
cried
mrya
dmftri
evna
.
i
shant
believe
anyone
i
know
she
doesnt
like
me
replied
natisha
boldly
as
she
took
the
letter
and
her
face
expressed
a
cold
and
angry
resolution
that
caused
mdrya
dmftri
evna
to
look
at
her
more
intently
and
to
frown
.
dont
answer
like
that
my
good
girl
she
said
.
what
i
say
is
true
write
an
answer
natasha
did
not
reply
and
went
to
her
own
room
to
read
princess
marys
letter
.
princess
mary
wrote
that
she
was
in
despair
at
the
misunderstanding
that
had
occurred
be
tween
them
.
whatever
her
fathers
feelings
might
be
she
begged
natasha
to
believe
that
she
could
not
help
loving
her
as
the
one
cho
sen
by
her
brother
for
whose
happiness
she
was
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
.
do
not
think
however
she
wrote
that
my
father
is
illdisposed
toward
you
.
he
is
an
invalid
and
an
old
man
who
must
be
forgiven
but
he
is
good
and
magnanimous
and
will
love
her
who
makes
his
son
happy
.
princess
mary
went
on
to
ask
natasha
to
fix
a
time
when
she
could
see
her
again
.
after
reading
the
letter
natdsha
sat
down
at
the
writing
table
to
answer
it
.
dear
princess
she
wrote
in
french
quickly
and
mechanically
and
then
paused
.
what
more
could
she
write
after
all
that
had
happened
the
evening
be
fore
yes
yes
all
that
has
happened
and
now
all
is
changed
she
thought
as
she
sat
with
the
letter
she
had
begun
before
her
.
must
i
break
off
with
him
must
i
really
thats
aw
ful

.

.

.
arid
to
escape
from
these
dreadful
thoughts
she
went
to
s6nya
and
began
sorting
patterns
with
her
.
after
dinner
nattsha
went
to
her
room
and
again
took
up
princess
marys
letter
.
can
it
be
that
it
is
all
over
she
thought
.
can
it
be
that
all
this
has
happened
so
quickly
and
has
destroyed
all
that
went
before
she
recalled
her
love
for
prince
andrew
in
all
its
former
strength
and
at
the
same
time
felt
that
she
loved
kurgin
.
she
vividly
pictured
herself
as
prince
andrews
wife
and
the
scenes
of
happi
ness
with
him
she
had
so
often
repeated
in
her
imagination
and
at
the
same
time
aglow
with
excitement
recalled
every
detail
of
yesterdays
interview
with
anatole
.
why
could
that
not
be
as
well
she
some
times
asked
herself
in
complete
bewilderment
.
only
so
could
i
be
completely
happy
but
now
i
have
to
choose
and
i
cant
be
happy
without
either
of
them
.
only
she
thought
to
tell
prince
andrew
what
has
happened
or
to
hide
it
from
him
are
both
equally
impos
sible
.
but
with
that
one
nothing
is
spoiled
.
but
am
i
really
to
abandon
forever
the
joy
of
prince
andrews
love
in
which
i
have
lived
so
long
please
miss
whispered
a
maid
entering
the
room
with
a
mysterious
air
.
a
man
told
me
to
give
you
this
and
she
handed
natrisha
a
letter
.
only
for
christs
sake

.

.

.
the
girl
went
on
as
natasha
without
thinking
mechanical
ly
broke
the
seal
and
read
a
love
letter
from
anatole
of
which
without
taking
in
a
word
she
understood
only
that
it
was
a
letter
from
him
from
the
man
she
loved
.
yes
she
loved
him
or
else
how
could
that
have
happened
which
had
happened
and
how
could
she
have
a
love
letter
from
him
in
her
hand
with
trembling
hands
natasha
held
that
book
passionate
love
letter
which
d61okhov
had
composed
for
anatole
and
as
she
read
it
she
found
in
it
an
echo
of
all
that
she
herself
im
agined
she
was
feeling
.
since
yesterday
evening
my
fate
has
been
sealed
to
be
loved
by
you
or
to
die
.
there
is
no
other
way
for
me
the
letter
began
.
then
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
knew
her
parents
would
not
give
her
to
him
for
this
there
were
secret
reasons
he
could
reveal
only
to
her
but
that
if
she
loved
him
she
need
only
say
the
word
yes
and
no
human
power
could
hinder
their
bliss
.
love
would
conquer
all
.
he
would
steal
her
away
and
carry
her
off
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
.
yes
yesl
i
love
him
thought
natasha
reading
the
letter
for
the
twentieth
time
and
finding
some
peculiarly
deep
meaning
in
each
word
of
it
.
that
evening
mdrya
dmftrievna
was
going
to
the
akhdrovs
and
proposed
to
take
the
girls
with
her
.
natasha
pleading
a
headache
remained
at
home
.
chapter
xv
on
returning
late
in
the
evening
sonya
went
to
natashas
room
and
to
her
surprise
found
her
still
dressed
and
asleep
on
the
sofa
.
open
on
the
table
beside
her
lay
anatoles
letter
.
sonya
picked
it
up
and
read
it
.
as
she
read
she
glanced
at
the
sleeping
na
tdsha
trying
to
find
in
her
face
an
explanation
of
what
she
was
reading
but
did
not
find
it
.
her
face
was
calm
gentle
and
happy
.
clutch
ing
her
breast
to
keep
herself
from
choking
sonya
pale
and
trembling
with
fear
and
agi
tation
sat
down
in
an
armchair
and
burst
into
tears
.
how
was
it
i
noticed
nothing
how
could
it
go
so
far
can
she
have
left
off
loving
prince
andrew
and
how
could
she
let
kuragin
go
to
such
lengths
he
is
a
deceiver
and
a
villain
thats
plain
what
will
nicholas
dear
noble
nicholas
do
when
he
hears
of
it
so
this
is
the
meaning
of
her
excited
resolute
unnatural
look
the
day
before
yesterday
yesterday
and
today
thought
s6nya
.
but
it
cant
be
that
she
loves
him
she
probably
opened
the
letter
without
knowing
who
it
was
from
.
probably
she
is
offended
by
it
.
she
could
not
do
such
a
thing
s6nya
wiped
away
her
tears
and
went
up
to
natasha
again
scanning
her
face
.
natdsha
1
she
said
just
audibly
.
natdsha
awoke
and
saw
s6nya
.
ah
youre
back
eight
327
and
with
the
decision
and
tenderness
that
often
come
at
the
moment
of
awakening
she
embraced
her
friend
but
noticing
s6nyas
look
of
embarrassment
her
own
face
expressed
confusion
and
suspicion
.
ils6nya
youve
read
that
letter
she
de
manded
.
yes
answered
sonya
softly
.
natasha
smiled
rapturously
.
no
s6nya
i
cant
any
longer
she
said
.
i
cant
hide
it
from
you
any
longer
.
you
know
we
love
one
another
s6nya
darling
he
writes

.

.

.
s6nya

.

.

.
s6nya
stared
openeyed
at
natdsha
unable
to
believe
her
ears
.
and
bolk6nski
she
asked
.
ah
sonya
if
you
only
knew
how
happy
i
am
cried
natdsha
.
you
dont
know
what
love
is

but
natasha
can
that
be
all
over
natasha
looked
at
sonya
with
wideopen
eyes
as
if
she
could
not
grasp
the
question
.
well
then
are
you
refusing
prince
an
drew
said
sonya
.
oh
you
dont
understand
anything
dont
talk
nonsense
just

said
natdsha
with
momentary
vexation
.
but
i
cant
believe
it
insisted
sonya
.
i
dont
understand
.
how
is
it
you
have
loved
a
man
for
a
whole
year
and
suddenly

.

.

.
why
you
have
only
seen
him
three
times
natdsha
i
dont
believe
you
youre
joking
in
three
days
to
forget
everything
and
so

.

.

.
three
days
said
natdsha
.
it
seems
to
me
ive
loved
him
a
hundred
years
.
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
never
loved
anyone
before
.
you
cant
understand
it
.

..
.
s6nya
wait
a
bit
sit
here
and
natdsha
embraced
and
kissed
her
.
i
had
heard
that
it
happens
like
this
and
you
must
have
heard
it
too
but
its
only
now
that
i
feel
such
love
.
its
not
the
same
as
be
fore
.
as
soon
as
i
saw
him
i
felt
he
was
my
mas
ter
and
i
his
slave
and
that
i
could
not
help
loving
him
.
yes
his
slave

.
you
dont
understand
that
.
what

sonya
cried
natd
sha
with
a
happy
yet
frightened
expression
.
but

cried
son
ya
.
i
cant

like

.
this
secret
cor
respondence

.

.

.
how
could
you
let
him
go
so
far
she
went
on
with
a
horror
and
disgust
she
could
hardly
conceal
.
i
told
you
that
i
have
no
will
natdsha
re
plied
.
why
cant
you
understand

s6nya
bursting
into
tears
.
328
what
do
you
mean
for
gods
sake

..
.
if
you
tell
you
are
my
enemy
declared
nat
sha
.
you
want
me
to
be
miserable
you
want
us
to
be
separated

when
she
saw
natashas
fright
s6nya
shed
tears
of
shame
and
pity
for
her
friend
.
but
what
has
happened
between
you
she
asked
.
what
has
he
said
to
you
why
doesnt
he
come
to
the
house
natdsha
did
not
answer
her
questions
.
for
gods
sake
s6nya
dont
tell
anyone
dont
torture
me
natdsha
entreated
.
re
member
no
one
ought
to
interfere
in
such
mat
ters
i
have
confided
in
you
.

.

.

.
but
why
this
secrecy
why
doesnt
he
come
to
the
house
asked
s6nya
.
why
doesnt
he
openly
ask
for
your
hand
you
know
prince
andrew
gave
you
complete
freedom
if
it
is
really
so
but
i
dont
believe
it
natasha
have
you
considered
what
these
secret
reasons
can
be
natasha
looked
at
s6nya
with
astonishment
.
evidently
this
question
presented
itself
to
her
mind
for
the
first
time
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
answer
it
.
i
dont
know
what
the
reasons
are
.
but
there
must
be
reasons
s6nya
sighed
and
shook
her
head
incredu
lously
.
if
there
were
reasons

..
.
she
began
.
but
natasha
guessing
her
doubts
inter
rupted
her
in
alarm
.
s6nya
one
cant
doubt
him
one
cant
one
cant
dont
you
understand
she
cried
.
does
he
love
you
does
he
love
me
natasha
repeated
with
a
smile
of
pity
at
her
friends
lack
of
comprehen
sion
.
why
you
have
read
his
letter
and
you
have
seen
him
.
but
if
he
is
dishonorable
he
dishonorable
if
you
only
knew
ex
claimed
natasha
.
if
he
is
an
honorable
man
he
should
either
declare
his
intentions
or
cease
seeing
you
and
if
you
wont
do
this
i
will
.
i
will
write
to
him
and
i
will
tell

father
and
of

i
dont

s6nya
i
dont
want
to
quarrel
with
you
but
go
for
gods
sake
got
war
and
peace
you
see
how
i
am
suffering
natasha
cried
angrily
in
a
voice
of
despair
and
repressed
ir
ritation
.
s6nya
burst
into
sobs
and
ran
from
the
room
.
natasha
went
to
the
table
and
without
a
moments
reflection
wrote
that
answer
to
prin
cess
mary
which
she
had
been
unable
to
write
all
the
morning
.
in
this
letter
she
said
briefly
that
all
their
misunderstandings
were
at
an
end
that
availing
herself
of
the
magnanimity
of
prince
andrew
who
when
he
went
abroad
had
given
her
her
freedom
she
begged
prin
cess
mary
to
forget
everything
and
forgive
her
if
she
had
been
to
blame
toward
her
but
that
she
could
not
be
his
wife
.
at
that
moment
this
all
seemed
quite
easy
simple
and
clear
to
na
tdsha
.
on
friday
the
rostovs
were
to
return
to
the
country
but
on
wednesday
the
count
went
with
the
prospective
purchaser
to
his
estate
near
moscow
.
on
the
day
the
count
left
s6nya
and
natl
sha
were
invited
to
a
big
dinner
party
at
the
kardgins
and
mrya
dmftrievna
took
them
there
.
at
that
party
natasha
again
met
ana
tole
and
s6nya
noticed
that
she
spoke
to
him
trying
not
to
be
overheard
and
that
all
through
dinner
she
was
more
agitated
than
ever
.
when
they
got
home
natasha
was
the
first
to
begin
the
explanation
sonya
expected
.
there
s6nya
you
were
talking
all
sorts
of
nonsense
about
him
natasha
began
in
a
mild
voice
such
as
children
use
when
they
wish
to
be
praised
.
we
have
had
an
explanation
today
.
well
what
happened
what
did
he
say
natdsha
how
glad
i
am
youre
not
angry
with
me
tell
me
everything
the
whole
truth
.
what
did
he
say
natdsha
became
thoughtful
.
ohs6nya
if
you
knew
him
as
i
do
he
said

.

.

.
he
asked
me
what
i
had
promised
bolk6n
ski
.
he
was
glad
i
was
free
to
refuse
him
.
s6nya
sighed
sorrowfully
.
but
you
havent
refused
bolk6nski
said
she
.
perhaps
i
have
.
perhaps
all
is
over
between
me
and
bolk6nski
.
why
do
you
think
so
badly
of
me
i
dont
think
anything
only
i
dont
under
stand
this

.

.

.
wait
a
bit
s6nya
youll
understand
every
thing
.
youll
see
what
a
man
he
is
now
dont
think
badly
ot
me
or
of
him
.
i
dont
think
bad
ly
of
anyone
i
love
and
pity
everybody
.
but
what
am
i
to
do
book
eight
s6nya
did
not
succumb
to
the
tender
tone
natdsha
used
toward
her
.
the
more
emotional
and
ingratiating
the
expression
of
natashas
face
became
the
more
serious
and
stern
grew
s6nyas
.
natasha
said
she
you
asked
me
not
to
speak
to
you
and
i
havent
spoken
but
now
you
yourself
have
begun
.
i
dont
trust
him
na
tdsha
.
why
this
secrecy
again
again
interrupted
natasha
.
natdsha
i
am
afraid
for
you
afraid
of
what
i
am
afraid
youre
going
to
your
ruin
said
s6nya
resolutely
and
was
herself
horrified
at
what
she
had
said
.
anger
again
showed
in
natashas
face
.
and
ill
go
to
my
ruin
i
will
as
soon
as
pos
sible
its
not
your
business
it
wont
be
you
but
i
wholl
suffer
.
leave
rne
alone
leave
me
alone
i
hate
you
natasha
moaned
sonya
aghast
.
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
youre
myenemy
for
ever
and
natasha
ran
out
of
the
room
.
natdsha
did
not
speak
to
sonya
again
and
avoided
her
.
with
the
same
expression
of
agi
tated
surprise
and
guilt
she
went
about
the
house
taking
up
now
one
occupation
now
an
other
and
at
once
abandoning
them
.
hard
as
it
was
for
sonya
she
watched
her
friend
and
did
not
let
her
out
of
her
sight
.
the
day
before
the
count
was
to
return
son
ya
noticed
that
natdsha
sat
by
the
drawing
room
window
all
the
morning
as
if
expecting
something
and
that
she
made
a
sign
to
an
offi
cer
who
drove
past
whom
sonya
took
to
be
anatolc
.
sonya
began
watching
her
friend
still
more
attentively
and
noticed
that
at
dinner
and
all
that
evening
natdsha
was
in
a
strange
and
un
natural
state
.
she
answered
questions
at
ran
dom
began
sentences
she
did
not
finish
and
laughed
at
everything
.
after
tea
sonya
noticed
a
housemaid
at
na
tdshas
door
timidly
waiting
to
let
her
pass
.
she
let
the
girl
go
in
and
then
listening
at
the
door
learned
that
another
letter
had
beendelivered
.
then
suddenly
it
became
clear
to
sonya
that
natdsha
had
some
dreadful
plan
for
that
eve
ning
.
sonya
knocked
at
her
door
.
natdsha
did
not
let
her
in
.
she
will
run
away
with
him
thought
s6n
ya
.
she
is
capable
of
anything
.
there
was
something
particularly
pathetic
and
resolute
in
her
face
today
.
she
cried
as
she
said
goodby
to
uncle
sonya
remembered
.
yes
thats
it
she
means
to
elope
with
him
but
what
am
i
to
329
do
thought
she
recalling
all
the
signs
that
clearly
indicated
that
natdsha
had
some
ter
rible
intention
.
the
count
is
away
.
what
am
i
to
do
write
to
kurdgin
demanding
an
ex
planation
but
what
is
there
to
oblige
him
to
reply
write
to
pierre
as
prince
andrew
asked
me
to
in
case
of
some
misfortune

.

.

.
but
per
haps
she
really
has
already
refused
bolk6nski
she
sent
a
letter
to
princess
mary
yesterday
.
and
uncle
is
away

to
tell
mdrya
dmftri
evna
who
had
such
faith
in
natdsha
seemed
to
s6nya
terrible
.
well
anyway
thought
son
ya
as
she
stood
in
the
dark
passage
now
or
never
i
must
prove
that
i
remember
the
fam
ilys
goodness
to
me
and
that
i
love
nicholas
.
yes
if
i
dont
sleep
for
three
nights
ill
not
leave
this
passage
and
will
hold
her
back
by
force
and
not
let
the
family
be
disgraced
thought
she
.
chapter
xvi
anatole
had
lately
moved
to
d61okhovs
.
the
plan
for
natalie
rostovas
abduction
had
been
arranged
and
the
preparations
made
by
d61o
khov
a
few
days
before
and
on
the
day
that
sonya
after
listening
at
natdshas
door
re
solved
to
safeguard
her
it
was
to
have
been
put
into
execution
.
natdsha
had
promised
to
come
out
to
kurdgin
at
the
back
porch
at
ten
that
evening
.
kurdgin
was
to
put
her
into
a
troyka
he
would
have
ready
and
to
drive
her
forty
miles
to
the
village
of
kdmenka
where
an
un
frocked
priest
was
in
readiness
to
perform
a
marriage
ceremony
over
them
.
at
kdmenka
a
relay
of
horses
was
to
wait
which
would
take
them
to
the
warsaw
highroad
and
from
there
they
would
hasten
abroad
with
post
horses
.
anatole
had
a
passport
an
order
for
post
horses
ten
thousand
rubles
he
had
taken
from
his
sister
and
another
ten
thousand
borrowed
with
dolokhovs
help
.
two
witnesses
for
the
mock
marriage
khvos
tikov
a
retired
petty
official
whom
dolokhov
made
use
of
in
his
gambling
transactions
and
makdrin
a
retired
hussar
a
kindly
weak
fel
low
who
had
an
unbounded
affection
for
kura
gin
were
sitting
at
tea
in
dolokhovs
front
room
.
in
his
large
study
the
walls
of
which
were
hung
to
the
ceiling
with
persian
rugs
bear
skins
and
weapons
sat
d61okhov
in
a
travel
ing
cloak
and
high
boots
at
an
open
desk
on
which
lay
an
abacus
and
some
bundles
of
paper
money
.
anatole
with
uniform
unbuttoned
walked
to
and
fro
from
the
room
where
the
witnesses
were
sitting
through
the
study
to
the
33
war
and
peace
room
behind
where
his
french
valet
and
oth
ers
were
packing
the
last
of
his
things
.
d61o
khovwas
counting
themoneyand
noting
some
thing
down
.
well
he
said
khv6stikov
must
have
two
thousand
.
give
it
to
him
then
said
anatole
.
makdrka
their
name
for
makdrin
will
go
through
fire
and
water
for
you
for
nothing
.
so
here
are
our
accounts
all
settled
said
ddlokhov
showing
him
the
memorandum
.
is
that
right
yes
of
course
returned
anatole
evident
ly
not
listening
to
d61okhov
and
looking
straight
before
him
with
a
smile
that
did
not
leave
his
face
.
d61okhov
banged
down
the
lid
of
his
desk
and
turned
to
anatole
with
an
ironic
smile
do
you
know
youd
really
better
drop
it
all
.
theres
still
time
fool
retorted
anatole
.

.

.

said
anatole
making
a
grimace
.
really
its
no
time
for
your
stupid
jokes
and
he
left
the
room
.
d61okhov
smiled
contemptuously
and
con
descendingly
when
anatole
had
gone
out
.
you
wait
a
bit
he
called
after
him
.
im
not
joking

.

anatole
returned
and
looked
at
d61okhov
trying
to
give
him
his
attention
and
evidently
submitting
to
him
involuntarily
.
now
listen
to
me
.

last
time

and
anatole
sighed
and
em
braced
d61okhov
.
i
helped
you
but
all
the
same
i
must
tell
you
the
truth

.

.

anatole
ejaculat
ed
and
again
made
a
grimace
.

anatole
with
the
partiality
dullwitted
people
have
for
any
con
clusion
they
have
reached
by
their
own
reason
ing
repeated
the
argument
he
had
already
put
to
d61okhov
a
hundred
times
.
didnt
i
ex
plain
to
you
that
i
have
come
to
this
conclu
sion
if
this
marriage
is
invalid
he
went
on
crooking
one
finger
then
i
have
nothing
to
answer
for
but
if
it
is
valid
no
matter
abroad
no
one

about
it
.
isnt
that
so
and
dont
talk
to
me
dont

.
seriously
youd
better
drop
it
youll
only
get
yourself
into
a
mess
go
to
the
devil
cried
anatole
and
clutch
ing
his
hair
left
the
room
but
returned
at
once
and
dropped
into
an
armchair
in
front
of
d61okhov
with
his
feet
tucked
under
him
.
its
the
very
devil
what
feel
how
it
beats
he
took
d61okhovs
hand
and
put
it
on
his
heart
.
what
a
foot
my
dear
fellow
what
a
glance
a
goddess
he
added
in
french
.
what
d61okhov
with
a
cold
smile
and
a
gleam
in
his
handsome
insolent
eyes
looked
at
him
evi
dently
wishing
to
get
some
more
amusement
out
of
him
.
well
and
when
the

.moneys
gone
what
then
what
then
eh
repeated
anatole
sincere
ly
perplexed
by
a
thought
of
the
future
.
what
then

.

.

.
then
i
dont
know
but
why
talk
nonsense
he
glanced
at
his
watch
.
itstime
anatole
went
into
the
back
room
.
now
then
i
nearly
ready
youre
dawdling

he
shouted
to
the
servants
.
d61okhov
put
away
the
money
called
a
foot
man
whom
he
ordered
to
bring
something
for
them
to
eat
and
drink
before
the
journey
and
went
into
the
room
where
khv6stikov
and
makrin
were
sitting
.
anatole
lay
on
the
sofa
in
the
study
leaning
on
his
elbow
and
smiling
pensively
while
his
handsome
lips
muttered
tenderly
to
himself
.
come
and
eat
something
.
have
a
drink
d61okhov
shouted
to
him
from
the
other
room
.
i
dont
want
to
answered
anatole
contin
uing
to
smile
.
come
balagd
is
here
.
anatole
rose
and
went
into
the
dining
room
.
balagd
was
a
famous
troyka
driver
who
had
known
d61okhov
and
anatole
some
six
years
and
had
given
them
good
service
with
his
troy
kas
.
more
than
once
when
anatoles
regiment
was
stationed
at
tver
he
had
taken
him
from
tver
in
the
evening
brought
him
to
moscow
by
daybreak
and
driven
him
back
again
the
next
night
.
more
than
once
he
had
enabled
dblokhov
to
escape
when
pursued
.
more
than
book
eight
33
once
he
had
driven
them
through
the
town
with
gypsies
and
ladykinsas
he
called
thecocottes
.
more
than
once
in
their
service
he
had
run
over
pedestrians
and
upset
vehicles
in
the
streets
of
moscow
and
had
always
been
pro
tected
from
the
consequences
by
my
gentle
men
as
he
called
them
.
he
had
ruined
more
than
one
horse
in
theirservice
.
more
than
once
they
had
beaten
him
and
more
than
once
they
had
made
him
drunk
on
champagne
and
ma
deira
which
he
loved
and
he
knew
more
than
one
thing
about
each
of
them
which
would
long
ago
have
sent
an
ordinary
man
to
siberia
.
they
often
called
balagd
into
their
orgies
and
made
him
drink
and
dance
at
the
gypsies
and
more
than
one
thousand
rubles
of
their
money
had
passed
through
his
hands
.
in
their
service
he
risked
his
skin
and
his
life
twenty
times
a
year
and
in
their
service
had
lost
more
horses
than
the
money
he
had
from
them
would
buy
.
but
he
liked
them
liked
that
mad
driving
at
twelve
miles
an
hour
liked
upsetting
a
driver
or
running
down
a
pedestrian
and
flying
at
full
gallop
through
the
moscow
streets
.
he
liked
to
hear
those
wild
tipsy
shouts
behind
him
get
on
get
on
when
it
was
impossible
to
go
any
faster
.
he
liked
giving
a
painful
lash
on
the
neck
to
some
peasant
who
more
dead
than
alive
was
already
hurrying
out
of
his
way
.
real
gentlemen
he
considered
them
.
anatole
and
d61okhov
liked
balagd
too
for
his
masterly
driving
and
because
he
liked
the
things
they
liked
.
with
others
balagd
bargained
charging
twentyfive
rubles
for
a
two
hours
drive
and
rarely
drove
himself
generally
let
ting
his
young
men
do
so
.
but
with
his
gentle
men
he
always
drove
himself
and
never
de
manded
anything
for
his
work
.
only
a
couple
of
times
a
year
when
he
knew
from
their
val
ets
that
they
had
money
in
hand
he
would
turn
up
of
a
morning
quite
sober
and
with
a
deep
bow
would
ask
them
to
help
him
.
the
gentle
men
always
made
him
sit
down
.
do
help
me
out
theodore
ivdnych
sir
or
your
excellency
he
would
say
.
i
am
quite
out
of
horses
.
let
me
have
what
you
can
to
go
to
the
fair
.
and
anatole
and
d61okhov
when
they
had
money
would
give
him
a
thousand
or
a
couple
of
thousand
rubles
.
balagd
was

at

sight
of
the

.
after
refusing

he
drank
it
and
wiped

anatole
went
out
of

and
returned
a
few
minutes
later
wearing
a
fur
coat
girt
with
a
silver
belt
and
a
sable
cap
jauntily
set
on
one
side
and
very
becoming
to
his
handsome
face
.
having
looked
in
a
mirror
and
standing
before
d61okhov
in

he
said
turning
to
makdrin
and
the
others
.
though
they
were
all
going
with
him
an
atole
evidently
wished
to
make
something
touching
and
solemn
out
of
this
address
to
his
comrades
.
he
spoke
slowly
in
a
loud
voice
and
throwing
out
his
chest
slightly
swayed
one
leg
.

also
emp

of

it
over

up
in

up
round

then
so

he
pushed

atoles
head
forward
to

left
by
the

through

was
seen

made
her
confess
every

intercepting

read

and
went
into

it
in

pushing
back
natasha
who
looked
at
her
with
astonished
but
tearless
eyes
she
locked
her
in
and
having
given
orders
to
the
yard
porter
to
admit
the
persons
who
would
be
com
ing
that
evening
but
not
to
let

and
having
told
the
footman
to
bring
them
up
to

she
seated
herself
in
the
drawing
room
to
await
the
abductors
.
when
gabriel
came
to
inform
her
that
the
men
who
had
come
had
run
away
again
she
rose
frowning
and
clasping
her
hands
behind
her
paced
through
the
rooms
a
long
time
con
sidering
what
she
should
do
.
toward
midnight
she
went
to
natashas
room
fingering
the
key
in
her
pocket
.
s6nya
was
sitting
sobbing
in
the
corridor

marya

as

tell
them
all
to
hold
their
tongues
and
will
hide
it
from
the
count
.
she
entered
the
room
with
resolute
steps
.
natasha
was
lying
on
the
sofa
her
head
hidden
in
her
hands
and
she
did
not
stir
.
she
was
in
just
the
same
posi
tion
in
which
marya
dmitrievna
had
left
her
.

touched
her

will

.
natasha
did
not
change
her
position
but
her
whole
body
heaved
with
noiseless
convulsive
sobs
which
choked
her
.
marya
dmitrievna
glanced
round
at
sonya
and
seated
herself
on
the
sofa
beside
natasha
.
its
lucky
for
him
that
he
escaped
me
but

him
she
said
in
her
rough
voice
.
do

i
am
saying

she
added
.
she
put
her
large
hand
under
natashas
face
and
turned
it
toward
her
.
both
marya
dmitrievna
and
sonya
were
amazed
when
they
saw
how
natasha
looked
.
her
eyes
were
dry
and
glistening
her
lips
compressed
her
cheeks
sunken
.
let
me
be

..
.
what
is
it
to
me

..
.

she
muttered
wrenching
herself
from
mdrya
dmitrievnas
hands
with
a
vicious
ef
fort
and
sinking
down
again
into
her
former
position
.

again

a

a
fact

exclaimed
natdsha
getting
up
.
if
you
hadnt
interfered

.

.

.
oh
my
god
what
is
it
all
what
is
it
sonya
why

..
.
go
away
and
she
burst
into
sobs
with
the
despairing
vehemence
with
which
people
bewail
disasters
they
feel
they
have
themselves
occasioned
.
mdrya
dmftrievna
was
about
to
speak
again
but
natdsha
cried
out
go
away
go
away
you
all
hate
and
despise
me
and
she
threw
herself
back
on
the
sofa
.
mdrya
dmitrievnawent
on
admonishing
her
for
some
time
en
joining
on
her
that
it
must
all
be
kept
from
her
father
and
assuring
her
that
nobody
would
know
anything
about
it
if
only
natdsha
herself
would
undertake
to
forget
it
all
and
not
let
anyone
see
that
something
had
happened
.
natdsha
did
not
reply
nor
did
she
sob
any
longer
but
she
grew
cold
and
had
a
shivering
fit
.
mdrya
dmitrievna
put
a
pillow
under
her
head
covered
her
with
two
quilts
and
herself
brought
her
some
limeflower
wa
ter
but
natdsha
did
not
respond
to
her
.
well
let
her
sleep
said
mdrya
dmitriev
na
as
she
went
out
of
the
room
supposing
na
tdsha
to
be
asleep
.
but
natdsha
was
not
asleep
with
pale
face
and
fixed
wideopen
eyes
she
looked
straight
before
her
.
all
that
night
she
did
not
sleep
or
weep
and
did
not
speak
to
s6nya
who
got
up
and
went
to
her
several
times
.
next
day
count
rostov
returned
from
his
estate
near
moscow
in
time
for
lunch
as
he
had
promised
.
he
was
in
very
good
spirits
the
af
fair
with
the
purchaser
was
going
on
satisfac
torily
and
there
was
nothing
to
keep
him
any
longer
in
moscow
away
from
the
countess
whom
he
missed
.
mdrya
dmftrievna
met
him
and
told
him
that
natdsha
had
been
very
un
well
the
day
before
and
that
they
had
sent
for
the
doctor
but
that
she
was
better

.
na
tdsha
had
not
left
her
room
that
morning
.
with
compressed
and
parched
lips
and
dry
fixed
eyes
she
sat
at
the
window
uneasily
watching
the
people
who
drove
past
and
hurriedly
glanc
ing
round
at
anyone
who
entered
the
room
.
she
was
evidently
expecting
news
of
him
and
that
he
would
come
or
would
write
to
her
.
when
the
count
came
to
see
her
she
turned
anxiously
round
at
the
sound
of
a
mans
foot
step
and
then
her
face
resumed
its
cold
and
malevolent
expression
.
she
did
not
even
get
up
to
greet
him
.
what
is
the
matter
with
you
my
angel
are
you
ill
asked
the
count
.
after
a
moments
silence
natdsha
answered
yes
ill
.
in
reply
to
the
counts
anxious
inquiries
as
to
why
she
was
so
dejected
and
whether
any
thing
had
happened
to
her
betrothed
she
as
sured
him
that
nothinghad
happened
and
asked
him
not
to
worry
.

confirmed
natdshas
assurances
that
nothing
had
hap
pened
.
from
the
pretense
of
illness
from
his
daughters
distress
and
by
the
embarrassed
faces
of
sonya
and
mdrya
dmftrievna
the
count
saw
clearly
that
something
had
gone
wrong
during
his
absence
but
it
was
so
terrible
for
him
to
think
that
anything
disgraceful
had
happened
to
his
beloved
daughter
and
he
so
prized
his
own
cheerful
tranquillity
that
he
avoided
inquiries
and
tried
to
assure
himself
that
nothing
particularly
had
happened
and
he
was
only
dissatisfied
that
her
indisposition
delayed
their
return
to
the
country
.
chapter
xix
from
the
day
his
wife
arrived
in
moscow
pierre
had
been
intending
to
go
away
some
where
so
as
not
to
be
near
her
.
soon
after
the
rostovs
came
to
moscow
the
effect
natdsha
had
on
him
made
him
hasten
to
carry
out
his
intention
.
he
went
to
tver
to
see
joseph
alexeevichs
widow
who
had
long
since
prom
ised
to
hand
over
to
him
some
papers
of
her
deceased
husbands
.
when
he
returned
to
moscow
pierre
was
handed
a
letter
from
mdrya
dmftrievna
ask
ing
him
to
come
and
see
her
on
a
matter
of
great
importance
relating
to
andrew
bolkon
ski
and
his
betrothed
.
pierre
had
been
avoid
ing
natdsha
because
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
feeling
for
her
was
stronger
than
a
married
mans
should
be
for
his
friends
fiancde
.
yet
some
fate
constantly
threw
them
together
.
what
can
have
happened
and
what
can
they
want
with
me
thought
he
ashedressedto
go
to
mdrya
dmftrievnas
.
if
only
prince
an
drew
would
hurry
up
and
come
and
marry
her
i
thought
he
on
his
way
to
the
house
.
on
the
tversk6y
boulevard
a
familiar
voice
called
to
him
.
pierre
been
back
long
someone
shouted

pierre
raised
his
head
.
in
a
sleigh
drawn
by
two
gray
trottinghorses
that
were
bespattering
the
dashboard
with
snow
anatole
and
his
constant
companion
makdrin
dashed
past
.
anatole
was
sitting
upright
in
the
classic
pose
of
military
dandies
the
lower
part
of
his
face
hidden
by
his
beaver
collar
and
his
head
slightly
bent
.
his
face
was
fresh
and
rosy
his
whiteplumed
hat
tilted
to
one
side
disclosed
his
curled
and
po
maded
hair
besprinkled
with
powdery
snow
.
yes
indeed
thats
a
true
sage
thought
pierre
.
he
sees
nothing
beyond
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
nothing
troubles
him
and
so
he
is
always
cheerful
satisfied
and
serene
.
what
wouldnt
i
give
to
be
like
himl
he
thought
enviously
.
in
mdrya
dmitrievnas
anteroom
the
foot
man
who
helped
him
off
with
his
fur
coat
said
that
the
mistress
asked
him
to
come
to
her
bed
room
.
when
he
opened
the
ballroom
door
pierre
saw
natdsha
sitting
at
the
window
with
a
thin
pale
and
spiteful
face
.
she
glanced
round
at
him
frowned
and
left
the
room
with
an
ex
pression
of
cold
dignity
.
what
has
happened
asked
pierre
enter
ing
marya
dmftrievnas
room
.
fine
doings
answered
mdrya
drnitrievna
.
for
fiftyeight
years
have
i
lived
in
this
world
and
never
known
anything
so
disgraceful
and
having
put
him
on
his
honor
not
to
repeat
anything
she
told
him
mdrya
drnitri
evna
informed
him
that
natasha
had
refused
prince
andrew
without
her
parents
knowl
edge
and
that
the
cause
of
this
was
anatole
kurdgin
into
whose
society
pierres
wife
had
thrown
her
and
with
whom
natdsha
had
tried
to
elope
during
her
fathers
absence
in
order
to
be
married
secretly
.
pierre
raised
his
shoulders
and
listened
open
mouthed
to
what
was
told
him
scarcely
able
to
believe
his
own
ears
.
that
prince
andrews
deeply
loved
affianced
wife
the
same
natdsha
rost6va
who
used
to
be
so
charming
should
give
up
bolk6nski
for
that
fool
anatole
who
was
already
secretly
married
as
pierre
knew
and
should
be
so
in
love
with
him
as
to
agree
to
run
away
with
him
was
something
pierre
could
not
conceive
and
could
not
imagine
.
he
could
not
reconcile
the
charming
impres
sion
he
had
of
natdsha
whom
he
had
known
from
a
child
with
this
new
conception
of
her
baseness
folly
and
cruelty
.
he
thought
of
his
wife
.
they
are
all
alikel
he
said
to
himself
reflecting
that
he
was
not
the
only
man
unfor
tunate
enough
to
be
tied
to
a
bad
woman
.
but
still
he
pitied
prince
andrew
to
the
point
of
tears
and
sympathized
with
his
wounded
pride
and
the
more
he
pitied
his
friend
the
more
did
he
think
with
contempt
and
even
with
disgust
of
that
natdsha
who
had
just
passed
him
in
the
ballroom
with
such
a
look
of
cold
dignity
.
he
did
not
know
that
natdshas
soul
was
over
flowing
with
despair
shame
and
humiliation
and
that
it
was
not
her
fault
that
her
face
hap
pened
to
assume
an
expression
of
calm
dignity
and
severity
.
but
how
get
married
said
pierre
in
an
swer
to
mdrya
dmftrievna
.
he
could
not
marry
he
is
married
things
get
worse
from
hour
to
hour
ejac
ulated
mdrya
dmftrievna
.
a
niceyouth
what
a
scoundrel
and
shes
expecting
him
expect
ing
him
since
yesterday
.
she
must
be
told
then
at
least
she
wont
go
on
expecting
him
.
after
hearing
the
details
of
anatoles
mar
riage
from
pierre
and
giving
vent
to
her
anger
against
anatole
in
words
of
abuse
mdrya
drnitrievna
told
pierre
why
she
had
sent
for
him
.
she
was
afraid
that
the
count
or
bolk6n
ski
who
might
arrive
at
any
moment
if
they
knew
of
this
affair
which
she
hoped
to
hide
from
them
might
challenge
anatole
to
a
duel
and
she
therefore
asked
pierre
to
tell
his
broth
erinlaw
in
her
name
to
leave
moscow
and
not
dare
to
let
her
set
eyes
on
him
again
.
pierre
only
now
realizing
the
danger
to
the
old
count
nicholas
and
prince
andrew
promised
to
do
as
she
wished
.
having
briefly
and
exactly
ex
plained
her
wishes
to
him
she
let
him
go
to
the
drawing
room
.
mind
the
count
knows
nothing
.
behave
as
if
you
know
nothing
either
she
said
.
and
i
will
go
and
tell
her
it
is
no
use
expecting
him
and
stay
to
dinner
if
you
care
to
she
called
after
pierre
.
pierre
met
the
old
count
who
seemed
nerv
ous
and
upset
.
that
morning
natdsha
had
told
him
that
she
had
rejected
bolk6nski
.
troubles
troubles
my
dear
fellow
he
said
to
pierre
.
what
troubles
one
has
with
these
girls
without
their
mother
i
do
so
regret
having
come
here
i
will
be
frank
with
you
.
have
you
heard
she
has
broken
off
her
engage
ment
without
consulting
anybody
its
true
this
engagement
never
was
much
to
my
liking
.
of
course
he
is
an
excellent
man
but
still
with
his
fathers
disapproval
they
wouldnt
have
been
happy
and
natdsha
wont
lack
suitors
.
still
it
has
been
going
on
so
long
and
to
take
such
a
step
without
fathers
or
mothers
con
sent
and
now
shes
ill
and
god
knows
what
336
war
and
peace
its
hard
count
hard
to
manage
daughters
in
their
mothers
absence
.

.

.

.
pierre
saw
that
the
count
was
much
upset
and
tried
to
change
the
subject
but
the
count
returned
to
his
troubles
.
s6nya
entered
the
room
with
an
agitated
face
.
natdsha
is
not
quite
well
shes
in
her
room
and
would
like
to
see
you
.
mdrya
dmftrievna
is
with
her
and
she
too
asks
you
to
come
.
yes
you
are
a
great
friend
of
bolk6nskis
no
doubt
she
wants
to
send
him
a
message
said
the
count
.
oh
dearl
oh
dearl
how
happy
it
all
was
and
clutching
the
spare
gray
locks
on
his
temples
the
count
left
the
room
.
when
mdrya
dmftrievna
told
natdsha
that
anatole
was
married
natdsha
did
not
wish
to
believe
it
and
insisted
on
having
it
confirmed
by
pierre
himself
.
s6nya
told
pierre
this
as
she
led
him
along
the
corridor
to
natashas
room
.
natdsha
pale
and
stern
was
sitting
beside
mdrya
dmftrievna
and
her
eyes
glittering
fe
verishly
met
pierre
with
a
questioning
look
the
moment
he
entered
.
she
did
not
smile
or
nod
butonlygazed
fixedly
at
him
and
her
look
asked
only
one
thing
was
he
a
friend
or
like
the
others
an
enemy
in
regard
to
anatole
as
for
pierre
he
evidently
did
not
exist
for
her
.
he
knows
all
about
it
said
mdrya
dmitri
evna
pointing
to
pierre
and
addressing
natd
sha
.
let
him
tell
you
whether
i
have
told
the
natdsha
looked
from
one
to
the
other
as
a
hunted
and
wounded
animal
looks
at
the
ap
proaching
dogs
and
sportsmen
.
natdlya
ilynfchna
pierre
began
drop
ping
his
eyes
with
a
feeling
of
pity
for
her
and
loathing
for
the
thing
he
had
to
do
whether
it
is
true
or
not
should
make
no
difference
to
you
because

..
.
then
it
is
not
true
that
hes
married
1
yes
it
is
true
.
has
he
been
married
long
she
asked
.
on
your
honor

.

.

.
pierre
gave
his
word
of
honor
.
is
he
still
here
she
asked
quickly
.
yes
i
have
just
seen
him
.
she
was
evidently
unable
to
speak
and
made
a
sign
with
her
hands
that
they
should
leave
her
alone
.
chapter
xx
pierre
did
not
stay
for
dinner
but
left
the
room
and
went
away
at
once
.
he
drove
through
the
town
seeking
anatole
kuragin
at
the
thought
of
whom
now
the
blood
rushed
to
his
heart
and
he
felt
a
difficulty
in
breathing
.
he
was
not
at
the
ice
hills
nor
at
the
gypsies
nor
at
komonenos
.
pierre
drove
to
the
club
.
in
the
club
all
was
going
on
as
usual
.
the
mem
bers
who
were
assembling
for
dinner
were
sit
ting
about
in
groups
they
greeted
pierre
and
spoke
of
the
town
news
.
the
footman
having
greeted
him
knowing
his
habits
and
his
ac
quaintances
told
him
there
was
a
place
left
for
him
in
the
small
dining
room
and
that
prince
michael
zakhdrych
was
in
the
library
but
paul
timofeevich
had
not
yet
arrived
.
one
of
pierres
acquaintances
while
they
were
talking
about
the
weather
asked
if
he
had
heard
of
kuragins
abduction
of
rostova
which
was
talked
of
in
the
town
and
was
it
true
pierre
laughed
and
said
it
was
nonsense
for
he
had
just
come
from
the
rostovs
.
he
asked
everyone
about
anatole
.
one
man
told
him
he
had
not
come
yet
and
another
that
he
was
coming
to
dinner
.
pierre
felt
it
strange
to
sec
this
calm
indifferent
crowd
of
people
unaware
of
what
was
going
on
in
his
soul
.
he
paced
through
the
ballroom
waited
till
everyone
had
come
and
as
anatole
had
not
turned
up
did
not
stay
for
dinner
but
drove
home
.
anatole
for
whom
pierre
was
looking
dined
that
day
with
d61okhov
consulting
him
as
to
how
to
remedy
this
unfortunate
affair
.
it
seemed
to
him
essential
to
see
natdsha
.
in
the
evening
he
drove
to
his
sisters
to
discuss
with
her
how
to
arrange
a
meeting
.
when
pierre
re
turned
home
after
vainly
hunting
all
over
moscow
his
valet
informed
him
that
prince
anatole
was
with
the
countess
.
the
countess
drawing
room
was
full
of
guests
.
pierre
without
greeting
his
wife
whom
lie
had
not
seen
since
his
return
at
that
moment
she
was
more
repulsive
to
him
than
everen
tered
the
drawing
room
and
seeing
anatole
went
up
to
him
.
ah
pierre
said
the
countess
going
up
to
her
husband
.
you
dont
know
what
a
plight
our
anatole

.

.

.
she
stopped
seeing
in
the
forward
thrust
of
her
husbands
head
in
his
glowing
eyes
and
his
resolute
gait
the
terrible
indications
of
that
rage
and
strength
which
she
knew
and
had
herself
experienced
after
his
duel
with
d61okh
ov
.
where
you
are
there
is
vice
and
evill
said
pierre
to
his
wife
.
anatole
come
with
me
i
must
speak
to
you
he
added
in
french
.
anatole
glanced
round
at
his
sister
and
rose
submissively
ready
to
follow
pierre
.
pierre
book

taking
him
by
the
arm
pulled
him
to
ward
him
self
and
was
leading
him
from
the
room
.
if
you
allow
yourself
in
my
drawing
room

.

.

.
whispered
hel6ne
but
pierre
did
not
re
ply
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
anatole
followed
him
with
his
usual
jaunty
step
but
his
face
betrayed
anxiety
.
having
entered
his
study
pierre
closed
the
door
and
addressed
anatole
without
looking
at
him
.
you
promised
countess
rost6va
to
marry
her
and
were
about
to
elope
with
her
is
that
so
mon
cher
answered
anatole
their
whole
conversation
was
in
french
i
dont
consider
myself
bound
to
answer
questions
put
to
me
in
that
tone
.
pierres
face
already
pale
became
distorted
by
fury
.
he
seized
anatole
by
the
collar
of
his
uniform
with
his
big
hand
and
shook
him
from
side
to
side
till
anatoles
face
showed
a
sufficient
degree
of
terror
.
when
i
tell
you
that
i
must
talk
to
you

.

.

.
repeated
pierre
.
come
now
this
is
stupid
.
what
said
ana
tole
fingering
a
button
of
his
collar
that
had
been
wrenched
loose
with
a
bit
of
the
cloth
.
youre
a
scoundrel
and
a
blackguard
and
i
dont
know
what
deprives
me
from
the
pleas
ure
of
smashing
your
head
with
this
said
pierre
expressing
himself
so
artificially
because
he
was
talking
french
.
he
took
a
heavy
paperweight
and
lifted
it
threateningly
but
at
once
put
it
back
in
its
place
.
did
you
promise
to
marry
her
i

..
.
i

..
.
i
didnt
think
of
it
.
i
never
prom
ised
because

..
.
pierre
interrupted
him
.
have
you
any
letters
of
hers
any
letters
he
said
moving
toward
anatole
.
anatole
glanced
at
him
and
immediately
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
drew
out
his
pocketbook
.
pierre
took
the
letter
anatole
handed
him
and
pushing
aside
a
table
that
stood
in
his
way
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
.

dont
be
afraid
said
pierre
in
answer
to
a
frightened
gesture
of
anatoles
.
first
the
letters
said
he
as
if
re
peating
a
lesson
to
himself
.
secondly
he
con
tinued
after
a
short
pause
again
rising
and
again
pacing
the
room
tomorrow
you
must
get
out
of
moscow
.
but
how
can
i

.

.

.
thirdly
pierre
continued
without
listen
ing
to
him
you
must
never
breathe
a
word
of
what
has
passed
between
you
and
countess
rost6va
.
i
know
i
cant
prevent
your
doing
so
but
if
you
have
a
spark
of
conscience

.

.

.
pierre
paced
the
room
several
times
in
silence
.
anatole
sat
at
a
table
frowning
and
biting
his
lips
.
after
all
you
must
understand
that
besides
your
pleasure
there
is
such
a
thing
as
other
peoples
happiness
and
peace
and
that
you
are
ruining
a
whole
life
for
the
sake
of
amusing
yourself
amuse
yourself
with
women
like
my
wife
with
them
you
are
within
your
rights
for
they
know
what
you
want
of
them
.
they
are
armed
against
you
by
the
same
experience
of
debauchery
but
to
promise
a
maid
to
marry
her

..
.
to
deceive
to
kidnap
.

.

.

.
dont
you
understand
that
it
is
as
mean
as
beating
an
old
man
or
a
child

.

.

.
pierre
paused
and
looked
at
anatole
no
longer
with
an
angry
but
with
a
questioning
look
.
i
dont
know
about
that
eh
said
anatole
growing
more
confident
as
pierre
mastered
his
wrath
.
i
dont
know
that
and
dont
want
to
he
said
not
looking
at
pierre
and
with
a
slight
tremor
of
his
lower
jaw
but
you
have
used
such
words
to
me
mean
and
so
on
which
as
a
man
of
honor
i
cant
allow
anyone
to
use
.
pierre
glanced
at
him
with
amazement
un
able
to
understand
what
he
wanted
.
though
it
was
teteatete
anatole
con
tinued
still
i
cant

.

.

.
is
it
satisfaction
you
want
said
pierre
ironically
.
you
could
at
least
take
back
your
words
.
what
if
you
want
me
to
do
as
you
wish
eh
i
take
them
back
i
take
them
back
said
pierre
and
i
ask
you
to
forgive
me
.
pierre
involun
tarily
glanc
eel
at
the
loose
button
.
and
if
you
require
money
lor
your
journey

.

.

.
anatole
smiled
.
the
expression
of
that
base
and
cringing
smile
which
pierre
knew
so
well
in
his
wife
revolted
him
.
oh
vile
and
heartless
brood
he
exclaimed
and
left
the
room
.
next
day
anatole
left
for
petersburg
.
chapter
xxi
pierre
drove
to
marya
dmitrievnas
to
tell
her
of
the
fulfillment
of
her
wish
that
kurdgin
should
be
banished
from
moscow
.
the
whole
house
was
in
a
state
of
alarm
and
commotion
.
natdsha
was
very
ill
having
as
mdrya
dmitri
evna
told
him
in
secret
poisoned
herself
the
night
after
she
had
been
told
that
anatole
was
338
war
and
peace
married
with
some
arsenic
she
had
stealthily
procured
.
after
swallowing
a
little
she
had
been
so
frightened
that
she
woke
s6nya
and
told
her
what
she
had
done
.
the
necessary
antidotes
had
been
administered
in
time
and
she
was
now
out
of
danger
though
still
so
weak
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
move
her
to
the
country
and
so
the
countess
had
been
sent
for
.
pierre
saw
the
distracted
count
and
s6nya
who
had
a
tearstained
face
but
he
could
not
see
natasha
.
pierre
dined
at
the
club
that
day
and
heard
on
all
sides
gossip
about
the
attempted
abduc
tion
of
rost6va
.
he
resolutely
denied
these
rumors
assuring
everyone
that
nothing
had
happened
except
that
his
brotherinlaw
had
proposed
to
her
and
been
refused
.
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
it
was
his
duty
to
conceal
the
whole
affair
and
reestablish
natdshas
reputation
.
he
was
awaiting
prince
andrews
return
with
dread
and
went
every
day
to
the
old
princes
for
news
of
him
.
old
prince
bolk6nski
heard
all
the
rumors
current
in
the
town
from
mademoiselle
bouri
enne
and
had
read
the
note
to
princess
mary
in
which
natdsha
had
broken
off
her
engage
ment
.
he
seemed
in
better
spirits
than
usual
and
awaited
his
son
with
great
impatience
.
some
days
after
anatoles
departure
pierre
received
a
note
from
prince
andrew
inform
ing
him
of
his
arrival
and
asking
him
to
come
to
see
him
.
as
soon
as
he
reached
moscow
prince
an
drew
had
received
from
his
father
natdshas
note
to
princess
mary
breaking
off
her
engage
ment
mademoiselle
bourienne
had
purloined
it
from
princess
mary
and
given
it
to
the
old
prince
and
he
heard
from
him
the
story
of
natdshas
elopement
with
additions
.
prince
andrew
had
arrived
in
the
evening
and
pierre
came
to
see
him
next
morning
.
pierre
expected
to
find
prince
andrew
in
al
most
the
same
state
as
natdsha
and
was
there
fore
surprised
on
entering
the
drawing
room
to
hear
him
in
the
study
talking
in
a
loud
ani
mated
voice
about
some
intrigue
going
on
in
petersburg
.
the
old
princes
voice
and
anoth
er
now
and
then
interrupted
him
.
princess
mary
came
out
to
meet
pierre
.
she
sighed
looking
toward
the
door
of
the
room
where
prince
andrew
was
evidently
intending
to
ex
press
her
sympathy
with
his
sorrow
but
pierre
saw
by
her
face
that
she
was
glad
both
at
what
had
happened
and
at
the
way
her
brother
had
taken
the
news
of
natashas
faithlessness
.
he
says
he
expected
it
she
remarked
.
i
know
his
pride
will
not
let
him
express
his
feelings
but
still
he
has
taken
it
better
far
better
than
i
expected
.
evidently
it
had
to
be
.

.

.

.
but
is
it
possible
that
all
is
really
ended
asked
pierre
.
princess
mary
looked
at
him
with
astonish
ment
.
she
did
not
understand
how
he
could
ask
such
a
question
.
pierre
went
into
the
study
.
prince
andrew
greatly
changed
and
plainly
in
better
health
but
with
a
fresh
horizontal
wrinkle
between
his
brows
stood
in
civilian
dress
facing
his
father
and
prince
meshchrski
warmly
disputing
and
vigorously
gesticulating
.
the
conversation
was
aout
sperdnski
the
news
of
whose
sudden
exile
and
alleged
treach
ery
had
just
reached
moscow
.
now
he
is
censured
and
accused
by
all
who
were
enthusiastic
about
him
a
month
ago
prince
andrew
was
saying
and
by
those
who
were
unable
to
understand
his
aims
.
to
judge
a
man
who
is
in
disfavor
and
to
throw
on
him
all
the
blame
of
other
mens
mistakes
is
very
easy
but
i
maintain
that
if
anything
good
has
been
accomplished
in
this
reign
it
was
done
by
him
by
him
alone
.
he
paused
at
the
sight
of
pierre
.
his
face
quivered
and
immediately
assumed
a
vindictive
expression
.
posterity
will
do
him
justice
he
concluded
and
at
once
turned
to
pierre
.
well
how
are
you
still
getting
stouter
he
said
with
animation
but
the
new
wrinkle
on
his
forehead
deepened
.
yes
i
am
well
he
said
in
answer
to
pierres
question
and
smiled
.
to
pierre
that
smile
said
plainly
i
am
well
but
my
health
is
now
of
no
use
to
anyone
.
after
a
few
words
to
pierre
about
the
awful
roads
from
the
polish
frontier
about
people
he
had
met
in
switzerland
who
knew
pierre
and
about
m
.
dessalles
whom
he
had
brought
from
abroad
to
be
his
sons
tutor
prince
an
drew
again
joined
warmly
in
the
conversation
about
sperdnski
which
was
still
going
on
be
tween
the
two
old
men
.
if
there
were
treason
or
proofs
of
secret
re
lations
with
napoleon
they
would
have
been
made
public
he
said
with
warmth
and
haste
.
i
do
not
and
never
did
like
sperdnski
per
sonally
but
i
like
justice
pierre
now
recognized
in
his
friend
a
need
with
which
he
was
only
too
familiar
to
get
ex
cited
and
to
have
arguments
about
extraneous
matters
in
order
to
stifle
thoughts
that
were
too
oppressive
and
too
intimate
.
when
prince
meshchrski
had
left
prince
andrew
took
pierres
arm
and
asked
him
into
the
room
that
had
been
assigned
him
.
a
bed
had
been
made
up
there
and
some
open
port
manteaus
and
trunks
stood
about
.
prince
an
drew
went
to
one
and
took
out
a
small
casket
from
which
he
drew
a
packet
wrapped
in
pa
per
.
he
did
it
all
silently
and
very
quickly
.
he
stood
up
and
coughed
.
his
face
was
gloomy
and
his
lips
compressed
.
forgive
me
for
troubling
you
.

.

.

.
pierre
saw
that
prince
andrew
was
going
to
speak
of
natasha
and
his
broad
face
expressed
pity
and
sympathy
.
this
expression
irritated
prince
andrew
and
in
a
determined
ringing
and
unpleasant
tone
he
continued
i
have
received
a
refusal
from
countess
rost6va
and
have
heard
reports
of
your
broth
erinlaw
having
sought
her
hand
or
something
of
that
kind
.
is
that
true
both
true
and
untrue
pierre
began
but
prince
andrew
interrupted
him
.
here
are
her
letters
and
her
portrait
said
he
.
he
took
the
packet
from
the
table
and
handed
it
to
pierre
.
give
this
to
the
countess

..
.
if
you
see
her
.
she
is
very
ill
said
pierre
.
then
she
is
here
still
said
prince
andrew
.
and
prince
kuragin
he
added
quickly
.
he
left
long
ago
.
she
has
been
at
deaths
door
.
i
much
regret
her
illness
said
prince
an
drew
and
he
smiled
like
his
father
coldly
maliciously
and
unpleasantly
.
so
monsieur
kuragin
has
not
honored
countess
rost6va
with
his
hand
said
prince
andrew
and
he
snorted
several
times
.
he
could
not
marry
for
he
was
married
al
ready
said
pierre
.
prince
andrew
laughed
disagreeably
again
reminding
one
of
his
father
.
and
where
is
your
brotherinlaw
now
if
i
may
ask
he
said
.
he
has
gone
to
peters

.

.

.
but
i
dont
know
said
pierre
.
well
it
doesnt
matter
said
prince
an
drew
.
tell
countess
rost6va
that
she
was
and
is
perfectly
free
and
that
i
wish
her
all
that
is
good
.
pierre
took
the
packet
.
prince
andrew
as
if
trying
to
remember
whether
he
had
something
more
to
say
or
waiting
to
see
if
pierre
would
say
anything
looked
fixedly
at
him
.
i
say
do
you
remember
our
discussion
in
petersburg
asked
pierre
about

..
.
yes
returned
prince
andrew
hastily
.
i
book
eight
359
said
that
a
fallen
woman
should
be
forgiven
but
i
didnt
say
i
could
forgive
her
.
i
cant
.
but
can
this
be
compared

.

.

.
said
pierre
.
prince
andrew
interrupted
him
and
cried
sharply
yes
ask
her
hand
again
be
magnani
mous
and
so
on

.

.

.
yes
that
would
be
very
noble
but
i
am
unable
to
follow
in
that
gen
tlemans
footsteps
.
if
you
wish
to
be
my
friend
never
speak
to
me
of
that

..
.
of
all
that
well
goodby
.
so
youll
give
her
the
packet
pierre
left
the
room
and
went
to
the
old
prince
and
princess
mary
.
the
old
man
seemed
livelier
than
usual
.
princess
mary
was
the
same
as
always
but
be
neath
her
sympathy
for
her
brother
pierre
noticed
her
satisfaction
that
the
engagement
had
been
broken
off
.
looking
at
them
pierre
realized
what
contempt
and
animosity
they
all
felt
for
the
rost6vs
and
that
it
was
impossible
in
their
presence
even
to
mention
the
name
of
her
who
could
give
up
prince
andrew
for
any
one
else
.
at
dinner
the
talk
turned
on
the
war
the
approach
of
which
was
becoming
evident
.
prince
andrew
talked
incessantly
arguing
now
with
his
father
now
with
the
swiss
tutor
des
salles
and
showing
an
unnatural
animation
the
cause
of
which
pierre
so
well
understood
.
chapter
xxii
that
same
evening
pierre
went
to
the
ros
t6vs
to
fulfill
the
commission
entrusted
to
him
.
natdsha
was
in
bed
the
count
at
the
club
and
pierre
after
giving
the
letters
to
s6nya
went
to
mdrya
dmitrievna
who
was
interested
to
know
how
prince
andrew
had
taken
the
news
.
ten
minutes
later
s6nya
came
to
mirya
dmitrievna
.
natdsha
insists
on
seeing
count
peter
kirf
lovich
said
she
.
but
how
are
we
to
take
him
up
to
her
the
room
there
has
not
been
tidied
up
.
no
she
has
dressed
and
gone
into
the
draw
ing
room
said
s6nya
.
mdrya
dmitrievna
only
shrugged
her
shoul
ders
.
when
will
her
mother
come
she
has
wor
ried
me
to
death
now
mind
dont
tell
her
everything
said
she
to
pierre
.
one
hasnt
the
heart
to
scold
her
she
is
so
much
to
be
pitied
so
much
to
be
pitied
.
natasha
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
drawing
room
emaciated
with
a
pale
set
face
but
not
at
all
shamefaced
as
pierre
expected
to
find
her
.
when
he
appeared
at
the
door
she
grew
flurried
evidently
undecided
whether
to
340
war
and
peace
go
to
meet
him
or
to
wait
till
he
came
up
.
pierre
hastened
to
her
.
he
thought
she
would
give
him
her
hand
as
usual
but
she
stepping
up
to
him
stopped
breathing
heavily
her
arms
hanging
lifelessly
just
in
the
pose
she
used
to
stand
in
when
she
went
to
the
middle
of
the
ballroom
to
sing
but
with
quite
a
dif
ferent
expression
of
face
.
peter
kirf
lovich
she
began
rapidly
prince
bolk6nski
was
your
friend
is
your
friend
she
corrected
herself
.
it
seemed
to
her
that
everything
that
had
once
been
must
now
be
different
.
he
told
me
once
to
apply
to
you

.

.

.
pierre
sniffed
as
he
looked
at
her
but
did
not
speak
.
till
then
he
had
reproached
herein
his
heart
and
tried
to
despise
her
but
he
now
felt
so
sorry
for
her
that
there
was
no
room
in
his
soul
for
reproach
.
he
is
here
now
tell
him

..
.
to
for

..
.
for
give
me
she
stopped
and
breathed
still
more
quick
ly
but
did
not
shed
tears
.
yes

..
.
i
will
tell
him
answered
pierre
but

.

.

.
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
natdsha
was
evidently
dismayed
at
the
thoughtof
what
he
might
think
she
had
meant
.
no
i
know
all
is
over
she
said
hurriedly
.
no
that
can
never
be
.
im
only
tormented
by
the
wrong
i
have
done
him
.
tell
him
only
that
i
beg
him
to
forgive
forgive
forgive
me
for
everything

she
trembled
all
over
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
.
a
sense
of
pity
he
had
never
before
known
overflowed
pierres
heart
.
i
will
tell
him
i
will
tell
him
everything
once
more
said
pierre
.
but

..
.
i
should
like
to
know
one
thing
.

.

.

.
know
what
natdshas
eyes
asked
.
i
should
like
to
know
did
you
love

.

.

.
pierre
did
not
know
how
to
refer
to
anatole
and
flushed
at
the
thought
of
him
did
you
love
that
bad
man
dont
call
him
bad
said
natasha
.
but
i
dont
know
dont
know
at
all
.

.

.

.
she
began
to
cry
arid
a
still
greater
sense
of
pity
tenderness
and
love
welled
up
in
pierre
.
he
felt
the
tears
trickle
under
his
spectacles
and
hoped
they
would
not
be
noticed
.
we
wont
speak
of
it
any
more
my
dear
said
pierre
and
his
gentle
cordial
tone
sud
denly
seemed
very
strange
to
natdsha
.

.
we
wont
speak
of
it
my
dear
ill
tell
him
everything
but
one
thing
1
beg
of
you
con
sider
me
your

the

crossed

event
took

opposed

to
human
nature

innumerable

in

of

but
which
those
who
committed
them
did
not
at
the
time
regard
as
being
crimes
.
what
produced
this
extraordinary
occur
rence
what
were
its
causes
the
historians
tell
us
with
naive
assurance
that
its
causes
were
the
wrongs
inflicted
on
the
duke
of
olden
burg
the
nonobservance
of
the
continental
system
the
ambition
of
napoleon
the
firm
ness
of
alexander
the
mistakes
of
the
diplo
matists
and
so
on
.
consequently
it
would
only
have
been
nec
essary
for
metternich
rumyanstev
or
talley
rand
between
a
levee
and
an
evening
party
to
have
taken
proper
pains
and
written
a
more
adroit
note
or
for
napoleon
to
have
written
to
alexander
my
respected
brother
i
con
sent
to
restore
the
duchy
to
the
duke
of
old
enburg
and
there
would
have
been
no
war
.
we
can
understand
that
the
matter
seemed
like
that
to
contemporaries
.
it
naturally
seemed
to
napoleon
that
the
war
was
caused
by
eng
lands
intrigues
as
in
fact
he
said
on
the
island
of
st
.
helena
.
it
naturally
seemed
to
members
of
the
english
parliament
that
the
cause
of
the
war
was
napoleons
ambition
to
the
duke
of
oldenburg
that
the
cause
of
the
war
was
the
violence
done
to
him
to
businessmen
that
the
cause
of
the
war
was
the
continental
sys
tem
which
was
ruining
europe
to
the
generals
and
old
soldiers
that
the
chief
reason
for
the
war
was
the
necessity
of
giving
them
employ
ment
to
the
legitimists
of
that
day
that
it
was
the
need
of
reestablishing
les
bons
principes
and
to
the
diplomatists
of
that
time
that
it
all
resulted
from
the
fact
that
the
alliance
be
tween
russia
and
austria
in
1809
had
not
been
sufficiently
well
concealed
from
napoleon
and
from
the
awkward
wording
of
memorandum
no
.
178
.
it
is
natural
that
these
and
a
count
less
and
infinite
quantity
of
other
reasons
the
number
depending
on
the
endless
diversity
of
points
of
view
presented
themselves
to
the
men
of
that
day
but
to
us
to
posterity
who
view
the
thing
that
happened
in
all
its
magni
tude
and
perceive
its
plain
and
terrible
mean
ing
these
causes
seem
insufficient
.
to
us
it
is
incomprehensible
that
millions
of
christian
men
killed
and
tortured
each
other
either
be
cause
napoleon
was
ambitious
or
alexander
was
firm
or
because
englands
policy
was
astute
or
the
duke
of
oldenburg
wronged
.
we
can
not
grasp
what
connection
such
circumstances
have
with
the
actual
fact
of
slaughter
and
vio
lence
why
because
the
duke
was
wronged
thousands
of
men
from
the
other
side
of
eu
rope
killed
and
ruined
the
people
of
smolensk
and
moscow
and
were
killed
by
them
.
to
us
their
descendants
who
are
not
his
torians
and
are
not
carried
away
by
the
process
of
research
and
can
therefore
regard
the
event
with
unclouded
common
sense
an
incalculable
number
of
causes
present
themselves
.
the
deeper
we
delve
in
search
of
these
causes
the
more
of
them
we
find
and
each
separate
cause
or
whole
series
of
causes
appears
to
us
equally
valid
in
itself
and
equally
false
by
its
insignif
icance
compared
to
the
magnitude
of
the
events
and
by
its
impotence
apart
from
the
cooperation
of
all
the
other
coincident
causes
to
occasion
the
event
.
to
us
the
wish
or
ob
jection
of
this
or
that
french
corporal
to
serve
a
second
term
appears
as
much
a
cause
as
na

had
napoleon
not
taken
offense
at
the
de
mand
that
he
should
withdraw
beyond
the
vistula
and
not
ordered
his
troops
to
advance
there
would
have
been
no
war
but
had
all
his
sergeants
objected
to
serving
a
second
term
then
also
there
could
have
been
no
war
.
nor
could
there
have
been
a
war
had
there
been
no
english
intrigues
and
no
duke
of
olden
burg
and
had
alexander
not
felt
insulted
and
had
there
not
been
an
autocratic
government
in
russia
or
a
revolution
in
france
and
a
subsequent
dictatorship
and
empire
or
all
the
things
that
produced
the
french
revolution
and
so
on
.
without
each
of
these
causes
noth
ing
could
have
happened
.
so
all
these
causes
myriads
of
causes
coincided
to
bring
it
about
.
and
so
there
was
no
one
cause
for
that
occur
rence
but
it
had
to
occur
because
it
had
to
.
millions
of
men
renouncing
their
human
feel
ings
and
reason
had
to
go
from
west
to
east
to
slay
their
fellows
just
as
some
centuries
previ
ously
hordes
of
men
had
come
from
the
east
to
the
west
slaying
their
fellows
.
the
actions
ot
napoleon
and
alexander
on
whose
words
the
event
seemed
to
hang
were
as
little
voluntary
as
the
actions
of
any
soldier
who
was
drawn
into
the
campaign
by
lot
or
by
conscription
.
this
could
not
be
otherwise
for
in
order
that
the
will
of
napoleon
and
alex
ander
on
whom
the
event
seemed
to
depend
should
be
carried
out
the
concurrence
of
in
numerable
circumstances
was
needed
without
any
one
of
which
the
event
could
not
have
tak
en
place
.
it
was
necessary
that
millions
of
men
in
whose
hands
lay
the
real
power
the
soldiers
who
fired
or
transported
provisions
and
guns
should
consent
to
carry
out
the
will
of
these
weak
individuals
and
should
have
been
in
duced
to
do
so
by
an
infinite
numberof
diverse
and
complex
causes
.
we
are
forced
to
fall
back
on
fatalism
as
an
explanation
of
irrational
events
that
is
to
say
events
the
reasonableness
of
which
we
do
not
understand
.
the
more
we
try
to
explain
such
events
in
history
reasonably
the
more
unrea
sonable
and
incomprehensible
do
they
become
to
us
.
each
man
lives
for
himself
using
his
free
dom
to
attain
his
personal
aims
and
feels
with
his
whole
being
that
he
can
now
do
or
abstain
from
doing
this
or
that
action
but
as
soon
as
he
has
done
it
that
action
performed
at
a
cer

moment
in

becomes
irrevocable
and
belongs
to
history
in
which
it
has
not
a
free
but
a
predestined
significance
.
there
are
two
sides
to
the
life
of
every
man
his
individual
life
which
is
the
more
free
the
more
abstract

the

so
forth

equal

right
with

says
the

fell
because
he
wanted

prayed
for

equally
right

wrong
is
he
who
says
that
napoleon
went
to

because
he

to

perished
because
alexander

army
and
at
every
station
gave
fresh
orders
to
accelerate
the
movement
of
his
troops
from
west
to
east
.
he
went
in
a
traveling
coach
with
six
horses
surrounded
by
pages
aidesde
camp
and
an
escort
along
the
road
to
posen
thorn
danzig
and
konigsberg
.
at
each
of
these
towns
thousands
of
people
met
him
with
excitement
and
enthusiasm
.
the
army
was
moving
from
west
to
east
and
relays
of
six
horses
carried
him
in
the
same
direction
.
on
the
tenth
of
june
2
coming
up
with
the
army
he
spent
the
night
in
apart
ments
prepared
for
him
on
the
estate
of
a
polish
count
in
the
vilkavisski
forest
.
next
day
overtaking
the
army
he
went
in
a
carriage
to
the
niemen
and
changing
into
a
polish
uniform
he
drove
to
the
riverbank
in
order
to
select
a
place
for
the
crossing
.
seeing
on
the
other
side
some
cossacks
ics
cosaques
and
the
widespreading
steppes
in
the
midst
of
which
lay
the
holy
city
of
moscow
moscou

the
capital
of
a
realm
such
as
the
scythia
into
which
alexander
the
great
had
marched
napoleon
unexpectedly
and
contrary
alike
to
strategic
and
diplomatic
considerations
ordered
an
advance
and
the
next
day
his
army
began
to
cross
the
niemen
.
early
in
the
morning
of
the
twelfth
of
june
he
came
out
of
his
tent
which
was
pitched
that
day
on
the
steep
left
bank
of
the
niemen
and
looked
through
a
spyglass
at
the
streams
of
his
troops
pouring
out
of
the
vilkavisski
forest
and
flowing
over
the
three
bridges
thrown
across
the
river
.
the
troops
knowing
of
the
emperors
presence
were
on
the
lookout
for
him
and
when
they
caught
sight
of
a
figure
in
an
overcoat
arid
a
cocked
hat
standing
apart
from
his
suite
in
front
of
his
tent
on
the
hill
they
threw
up
their
caps
and
shouted
vive

and
one
after
another
poured
in
a
ceaseless
stream
out
of
the
vast
forest
that
had
concealed
them
and
separating
flowed
on
and
on
by
the
three
bridges
to
the
other
side

came
the
voices
of
men
old
and
young
of
most
diverse
characters
and
social
positions
.
on
the
faces
of
all
was
one
common
expression
of
joy
at
the
commencement
of
the
longexpected
campaign
and
of
rapture
and
devotion
to
the
man
in
the
gray
coat
who
was
standing
on
the
hill
.
on
the
thirteenth
of
june
a
rather
small
thoroughbred
arab
horse
was
brought
to
na
poleon
.
he
mounted
it
and
rode
at
a
gallop
to
one
of
the
bridges
over
the
niemcn
deafened
continually
by
incessant
and
rapturous
accla
mations
which
he
evidently
endured
only
be
cause
it
was
impossible
to
forbid
the
soldiers
to
express
their
love
of
him
by
such
shouting
but
the
shouting
which
accompanied
him
every
where
disturbed
him
and
distracted
him
from
the
military
cares
that
had
occupied
him
from
the
time
he
joined
the
army
.
he
rode
across
one
of
the
swaying
pontoon
bridges
to
the
far
ther
side
turned
sharply
to
the
left
and
gal
loped
in
the
direction
of
k6vno
preceded
by
enraptured
mounted
chasseurs
of
the
guard
who
breathless
with
delight
galloped
ahead
to
clear
a
path
for
him
through
the
troops
.
on
reaching
the
broad
river
viliya
he
stopped
near
a
regiment
of
polish
uhlans
stationed
by
the
river
.
vivat
shouted
the
poles
ecstatically
breaking
their
ranks
and
pressing
against
one
another
to
see
him
.
napoleon
looked
up
and
down
the
river
dismounted
and
sat
down
on
a
log
that
lay
on
the
bank
.
at
a
mute
sign
from
him
a
telescope
was
handed
him
which
he
rested
on
the
back
of
a
happy
page
who
had
run
up
to
him
and
he
gazed
at
the
opposite
bank
.
then
he
be
came
absorbed
in
a
map
laid
out
on
the
logs
.
without
lifting
his
head
he
said
something
and
two
of
his
aidesdecamp
galloped
off
to
the
polish
uhlans
.
what
what
did
he
say
was
heard
in
the
ranks
of
the
polish
uhlans
when
one
of
the
aidesdecamp
rode
up
to
them
.
the
order
was
to
find
a
ford
and
to
cross
the
river
.
the
colonel
of
the
polish
uhlans
a
handsome
old
man
flushed
and
fumbling
in
his
speech
from
excitement
asked
the
aidede
nine
345
camp
whether
he
would
be
permitted
to
swim
the
river
with
his
uhlans
instead
of
seeking
a
ford
.
in
evident
fear
of
refusal
like
a
boy
asking
for
permission
to
get
on
a
horse
he
begged
to
be
allowed
to
swim
across
the
river
before
the
emperors
eyes
.
the
aidedecamp
replied
that
probably
the
emperor
would
not
be
displeased
at
this
excess
of
zeal
.
as
soon
as
the
aidedecamp
had
said
this
the
old
mustached
officer
with
happy
face
and
sparkling
eyes
raised
his
saber
shouted
fi
vat
and
commanding
the
uhlans
to
follow
him
spurred
his
horse
and
galloped
into
the
river
.
he
gave
an
angry
thrust
to
his
horse
which
had
grown
restive
under
him
and
plunged
into
the
water
heading
for
the
deep
est
part
where
the
current
was
swift
.
hun
dreds
of
uhlans
galloped
in
after
him
.
it
was
cold
and
uncanny
in
the
rapid
current
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
and
the
uhlans
caught
hold
of
one
another
as
they
fell
off
their
horses
.
some
of
the
horses
were
drowned
and
some
of
the
men
the
others
tried
to
swim
on
some
in
the
saddle
and
some
clinging
to
their
horses
manes
.
they
tried
to
make
their
way
forward
to
the
opposite
bank
and
though
there
was
a
ford
one
third
of
a
mile
away
were
proud
that
they
were
swimming
and
drowning
in
this
riv
er
under
the
eyes
of
the
man
who
sat
on
the
log
and
was
not
even
looking
at
what
they
were
doing
.
when
the
aidedecamp
having
re
turned
and
choosing
an
opportune
moment
ventured
to
draw
the
emperors
attention
to
the
devotion
of
the
poles
to
his
person
the
lit
tle
man
in
the
gray
overcoat
got
up
and
hav
ing
summoned
berthier
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
bank
with
him
giving
him
instruc
tions
and
occasionally
glancing
disapproving
ly
at
the
drowning
uhlans
who
distracted
his
attention
.
for
him
it
was
no
new
conviction
that
his
presence
in
any
part
of
the
world
from
africa
to
the
steppes
of
muscovy
alike
was
enough
to
dumfound
people
and
impel
them
to
insane
selfoblivion
.
he
called
for
his
horse
and
rode
to
his
quarters
.
some
forty
uhlans
were
drowned
in
the
riv
er
though
boats
were
sent
to
their
assistance
.
the
majority
struggled
back
to
the
bank
from
which
they
had
started
.
the
colonel
and
some
of
his
men
got
across
and
with
difficulty
clam
bered
out
on
the
further
bank
.
and
as
soon
as
they
had
got
out
in
their
soaked
and
stream
ing
clothes
they
shouted
vivat
and
looked
ecstatically
at
the
spot
where
napoleon
had
been
but
where
he
no
longer
was
and
at
that
346
moment
considered
themselves
happy
.

evening

the
emperor
of
russia
had
meanwhile
been
in
vilna
for
more
than
a
month
reviewing
troops
and
holding
maneuvers
.
nothing
was
ready
for
the
war
that
everyone
expected
and
to
prepare
for
which
the
emperor
had
come
from
petersburg
.
there
was
no
general
plan
of
action
.
the
vacillation
between
the
various
plans
that
were
proposed
had
even
increased
after
the
emperor
had
been
at
headquarters
for
a
month
.
each
of
the
three
armies
had
its
own
commander
in
chief
but
there
was
no
supreme
commander
of
all
the
forces
and
the
emperor
did
not
assume
that
responsibility
himself
.
the
longer
the
emperor
remained
in
vilna
the
less
did
everybodytired
of
waiting
pre
pare
for
the
war
.
all
the
efforts
of
those
who
surrounded
the
sovereign
seemed
directed
merely
to
making
him
spend
his
time
pleasant
ly
and
forget
that
war
was
impending
.
in
june
after
many
balls
and
fetes
given
by
the
polish
magnates
by
the
courtiers
and
by
the
emperor
himself
it
occurred
to
one
of
the
polish
aidesdecamp
in
attendance
that
a
din
ner
and
ball
should
be
given
for
the
emperor
by
his
aidesdecamp
.
this
idea
was
eagerly
re
ceived
.
the
emperor
gave
his
consent
.
the
aidesdecamp
collected
money
by
subscription
.
the
lady
who
was
thought
to
be
most
pleasing
to
the
emperor
was
invited
to

it

connoisseurs
of
such
matters
declared
that
rarely
had
so
many
beautiful
women
been
assembled
in
one
place
.
countess
beziikhova
was
present
among
other
russian
ladies
who
had
followed
the
sov
ereign
from
petersburg
to
vilna
and
eclipsed
the
refined
polish
ladies
by
her
massive
so
called
russian
type
of
beauty
.
the
emperor
noticed
her
and
honored
her
with
a
dance
.
boris
drubetsk6y
having
left
his
wife
in
moscow
and
being
for
the
present
en
gargon
as
he
phrased
it
was
also
there
and
though
not
an
aidedecamp
had
subscribed
a
large
sum
toward
the
expenses
.
boris
was
now
a
rich
man
who
had
risen
to
high
honors
and
no
longer
sought
patronage
but
stood
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
highest
of
those
of
his
own
age
.
he
was
meeting
hlne
in
vilna
after
not
having
seen
her
for
a
long
time
and
did
not
recall
the
past
but
as
hdfcne
was
enjoying
the
favors
of
a
very
important
personage
and
boris
had
only
recently
married
they
met
as
good
friends
of
long
standing
.
at
midnight
dancing
was
still
going
on
.
hlne
not
having
a
suitable
partner
herself
offered
to
dance
the
mazurka
with
boris
.
they
were
the
third
couple
.
boris
coolly
looking
at
hlnes
dazzling
bare
shoulders
which
e
merged
from
a
dark
goldembroidered
gauze
gown
talked
to
her
of
old
acquaintances
and
at
the
same
time
unaware
of
it
himself
and
unnoticed
by
others
never
for
an
instant
ceased
to
observe
the
emperor
who
was
in
the
same
room
.
the
emperor
was
not
dancing
he
stood
in
the
doorway
stopping
now
one
pair
and
now
another
with
gracious
words
which
he
alone
knew
how
to
utter
.
as
the
mazurka
began
boris
saw
that
adju
tant
general
balashev
one
of
those
in
closest
attendance
on
the
emperor
went
up
to
him
and
contrary
to
court
etiquette
stood
near
him
while
he
was
talking
to
a
polish
lady
.
having
finished
speaking
to
her
the
emperor
looked
inquiringly
at
balashev
and
evidently
under
standing
that
he
only
acted
thus
because
there
were
important
reasons
for
so
doing
nodded
slightly
to
the
lady
and
turned
to
him
.
hardly
had
balashgv
begun
to
speak
before
a
look
of
amazement
appeared
on
the
emperors
face
.
he
took
balashev
by
the
arm
and
crossed
the
room
with
him
unconsciously
clearing
a
path
seven
yards
wide
as
the
people
on
both
sides
made
way
for
him
.
boris
noticed
arakchevs
excited
face
when
the
sovereign
went
out
with
balashev
.
arakcheev
looked
at
the
emperor
from
under
his
brow
and
sniffing
with
his
red
nose
stepped
forward
from
the
crowd
as
if
ex
pecting
the
emperor
to
address
him
.
boris
understood
that
arakcheev
envied
balashev
and
was
displeased
that
evidently
important
news
had
reached
the
emperor
otherwise
than
through
himself
.
but
the
emperor
and
balashev
passed
out
into
the
illuminated
garden
without
noticing
arakchev
who
holding
his
sword
and
glanc
ing
wrathfully
around
followed
some
twenty
paces
behind
them
.
all
the
time
boris
was
going
through
the
figures
of
the
mazurka
he
was
worried
by
the
question
of
what
news
balashev
had
brought
and
how
he
could
find
it
out
before
others
.
in
the
figure
in
which
he
had
to
choose
two
ladies
he
whispered
to
hlne
that
he
meant
to
choose
countess
potocka
who
he
thought
had
gone
out
onto
the
veranda
and
glided
over
the
parquet
to
the
door
opening
into
the
gar
den
where
seeing
balashev
and
the
emperor
returning
to
the
veranda
he
stood
still
.
they
were
moving
toward
the
door
.
boris
fluttering
as
if
he
had
not
had
time
to
withdraw
respect
fully
pressed
close
to
the
doorpost
with
bowed
head
.
the
emperor
with
the
agitation
of
one
who
has
been
personally
affronted
was
finishing
with
these
words
to
enter
russia
without
declaring
war
i
will
not
make
peace
as
long
as
a
single
armed
enemy
remains
in
my
country
it
seemed
to
boris
that
it
gave
the
emperor
pleasure
to
utter
these
words
.
he
was
satisfied
with
the
form
in
which
he
had
expressed
his
thoughts
but
displeased
that
boris
had
over
heard
it
.
let
no
one
know
of
it
the
emperor
added
with
a
frown
.
boris
understood
that
this
was
meant
for
him
and
closing
his
eyes
slightly
bowed
his
head
.
the
emperor
reentered
the
ballroom
and
remained
there
about
another
halfhour
.
boris
was
thus
the
first
to
learn
the
news
that
the
french
army
had
crossed
the
niemen
and
thanks
to
this
was
able
to
show
certain
important
personages
that
much
that
was
con
cealed
from
others
was
usually
known
to
him
and
by
this
means
he
rose
higher
in
their
esti
mation
.

the
unexpected
news
of
the
french
having
crossed
the
niemen
was
particularly
startling
after
a
month
of
unfulfilled
expectations
and
book
nine
347
at
a
ball
.
on
first
receiving
the
news
under
the
influence
of
indignation
and
resentment
the
emperor
had
found
a
phrase
that
pleased
him
fully
expressed
his
feelings
and

.
on
returning
home
at
two
oclock
that
night
he
sent
for
his
secretary
shishk6v
and
told
him
to
write
an
order
to
the
troops
and
a
rescript
to
field
marshal
prince
saltyk6v
in
which
he
insisted
on
the
words
being
inserted
that
he
would
not
make
peace
so
long

a
single
armed
frenchman
re
mained
on

next

the
following
letter
was
sent
to
napoleon
monsieur
mon
frre
yesterday
i
learned
that
despite
the
loyalty
with
which
i
have
kept
my
engagements
with
your
majesty
your
troops
have
crossed
the
russian
frontier
and
i
have
this
moment
received
from
petersburg
a
note
in
which
count
lauriston
in
forms
me
as
a
reason
for
this
aggression
that
your
majesty
has
considered
yourself
to
be
in
a
state
of
war
with
me
from
the
time
prince
kurakin
asked
for
his
passports
.
the
reasons
on
which
the
due
de
bassano
based
his
refusal
to
deliver
them
to
him
would
never
have
led
me
to
suppose
that
that
incident
could
serve
as
a
pretext
for
aggression
.
in
fact
the
ambassador
as
he
himself
has
declared
was
never
authorized
to
make
that
demand
and
as
soon
as
i
was
informed
of
it
i
let
him
know
how
much
i
disapproved
of
it
and
ordered
him
to
re

at
his

if
your
majesty
does
not
intend
to
shed
the
blood
of
our
peoples
for
such
a
mis
understanding
and
consents
to
withdraw
your
troops
from
russian
territory
i
will
regard
what
has
passed
as
not

nothing

signed
alexander
chapter
iv
at
two
in
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
of
june
the
emperor
having
sent
for
balashev
and
read
him
his
letter
to
napoleon
ordered
him
to
take
it
and
hand
it
personally
to
the
french
emperor
.
when
dispatching
balashev
the
emperor
repeated
to
him
the
worcfc
that
he
would
not
make
peace
so
long
as
a
single
armed
enemy
remained
on
russian
soil
and
told
him
to
transmit
those
words
to
napoleon
.
alexander
did
not
insert
them
in
his
letter
to
napoleon
because
with
his
characteristic
tact
he
felt
it
would
be
injudicious
to
use
them
at
a
moment
when
a
last
attempt
at
reconcili
348
ation
was
being
made
but
he
definitely
in
structed
balashev
to
repeat
them
personally
to
napoleon
.
having
set
off
in
the
small
hours
of
the
four
teenth
accompanied
by
a
bugler
and
two
cos
sacks
balashev
reached
the
french
outposts
at
the
village
of
ryk6nty
on
the
russian
side
of
the
niemen
by
dawn
.
there
he
was
stopped
by
french
cavalry
sentinels
.
a
french
noncommissioned
officer
of
hus
sars
in
crimson
uniform
and
a
shaggy
cap
shouted
to
the
approaching
balashev
to
halt
.
balashev
did
not
do
so
at
once
but
continued
to
advance
along
the
road
at
a
walking
pace
.
the
noncommissioned
officer
frowned
and
muttering
words
of
abuse
advanced
his
horses
chest
against
balashev
put
his
hand
to
his
saber
and
shouted
rudely
at
the
russian
gen
eral
asking
was
he
deaf
that
he
did
not
do
as
he
was
told
balashev
mentioned
who
he
was
.
the
noncommissioned
officer
began
talking
with
his
comrades
about
regimental
matters
without
looking
at
the
russian
general
.
after
living
at
the
seat
of
the
highest
author
ity
and
power
after
conversing
with
the
em
peror
less
than
three
hours
before
and
in
gen
eral
being
accustomed
to
the
respect
due
to
his
rank
in
the
service
balashcv
found
it
very
strange
here
on
russian
soil
to
encounter
this
hostile
and
still
more
this
disrespectful
appli
cation
of
brute
force
to
himself
.
the
sun
was
only
just
appearing
from
be
hind
the
clouds
the
air
was
fresh
and
dewy
.
a
herd
of
cattle
was
being
driven
along
the
road
from
the
village
and
over
the
fields
the
larks
rose
trilling
one
after
another
like
bubbles
rising
in
water
.
balashev
looked
around
him
awaiting
the
arrival
of
an
officer
from
the
village
.
the
rus
sian
cossacks
and
bugler
and
the
french
hus
sars
looked
silently
at
one
another
from
time
to
time
.
a
french
colonel
of
hussars
who
had
evi
dently
just
left
his
bed
came
riding
from
the
village
on
a
handsome
sleek
gray
horse
accom
panied
by
two
hussars
.
the
officer
the
soldiers
and
their
horses
all
looked
smart
and
well
kept
.
it
was
that
first
period
of
a
campaign
when
troops
are
still
in
full
trim
almost
like
that
of
peacetime
maneuvers
but
with
a
shade
of
mar
tial
swagger
in
their
clothes
and
a
touch
of
the
gaiety
and
spirit
of
enterprise
which
always
ac
company
the
opening
of
a
campaign
.
the
french
colonel
with
difficulty
repressed
a
yawn
but
was
polite
and
evidently
under
war
and
peace
stood
balashevs
importance
.
he
led
him
past
his
soldiers
and
behind
the
outposts
and
told
him
that
his
wish
to
be
presented
to
the
em
peror
would
most
likely
be
satisfied
immedi
ately
as
the
emperors
quarters
were
he
be
lieved
not
far
off
.
they
rode
through
the
village
of
ryk6nty
past
tethered
french
hussar
horses
past
senti
nels
and
men
who
saluted
their
colonel
and
stared
with
curiosity
at
a
russian
uniform
and
came
out
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
.
the
colonel
said
that
the
commander
of
the
divi
sion
was
a
mile
and
a
quarter
away
and
would
receive
balashev
and
conduct
him
to
his
desti
nation
.
the
sun
had
by
now
risen
and
shone
gaily
on
the
bright
verdure
.
they
had
hardly
ridden
up
a
hill
past
a
tavern
before
they
saw
a
group
of
horsemen
coming
toward
them
.
in
front
of
the
group
on
a
black
horse
with
trappings
that
glittered
in
the
sun
rode
a
tall
man
with
plumes
in
his
hat
and
black
hair
curling
down
to
his
shoulders
.
he
wore
a
red
mantle
and
stretched
his
long
legs
forward
in
french
fashion
.
this
man
rode
toward
balashev
at
a
gallop
his
plumes
flow
ing
and
his
gems
and
gold
lace
glittering
in
the
bright
june
sunshine
.
balashev
was
only
two
horses
length
from
the
equestrian
with
the
bracelets
plumes
neck
laces
and
gold
embroidery
who
was
galloping
toward
him
with
a
theatrically
solemn
counte
nance
when
julner
the
french
colonel
whis
pered
respectfully
the
king
of
naples
it
was
in
fact
murat
now
called
king
of
na
ples
.
though
it
was
quite
incomprehensible
why
he
should
be
king
of
naples
he
was
called
so
and
was
himself
convinced
that
he
was
so
and
therefore
assumed
a
more
solemn
and
important
air
than
formerly
.
he
was
so
sure
that
he
really
was
the
king
of
naples
that
when
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
from
that
city
while
walking
through
the
streets
with
his
wife
some
italians
called
out
to
him
viva

re

he
turned
to
his
wife
with
a
pensive
smile
and
said
poor
fellows
they
dont
know
that
i
am
leaving
them
tomorrow
i
but
though
he
firmly
believed
himself
to
be
king
of
naples
and
pitied
the
grief
felt
by
the
subjects
he
was
abandoning
latterly
after
he
had
been
ordered
to
return
to
military
service
and
especially
since
his
last
interview
with
napoleon
in
danig
when
his
august
brother
inlaw
had
told
him
i
made
you
king
that
you
should
reign
in
my
way

he
had
cheerfully
taken
up
his
familiar
busi
ness
andlike
a
wellfed
but
not
overfat
horse
that
feels
himself
in
harness
and
grows
skittish
between
the
shafts
he
dressed
up
in
clothes
as
variegated
and
expensive
as
possible
and
gaily
and
contentedly
galloped
along
theroads
of
poland
without
himself
knowing
why
or
whither
.
on
seeing
the
russian
general
he
threw
back
his
head
with
its
long
hair
curling
to
his
shoul
ders
in
a
majestically
royal
manner
and
looked
inquiringly
at
the
french
colonel
.
the
colonel
respectfully
informed
his
majesty
of
balashevs
mission
whose
name
he
could
not
pronounce
.
de
balmachve
said
the
king
overcom
ing
by
his
assurance
the
difficulty
that
had
pre
sented
itself
to
the
colonel
.
charmed
to
make
your
acquaintance
general
he
added
with
a
gesture
of
kingly
condescension
.
as
soon
as
the
king
began
to
speak
loud
and
fast
his
royal
dignity
instantly
forsook
him
and
without
noticing
it
he
passed
into
his
nat
ural
tone
of
goodnatured
familiarity
.
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
withers
of
balashevs
horse
and
said
well
general
it
all
looks
like
war
as
if
regretting
a
circumstance
of
which
he
was
un
able
to
judge
.
your
majesty
replied
balashev
my
mas
ter
the
emperor
does
not
desire
war
and
as
your
majesty
sees

.

.
said
balashev
using
the
words
your
majesty
at
every
opportunity
with
the
affectation
unavoidable
in
frequently
addressing
one
to
whom
the
title
was
still
a
novelty
.
murats
face
beamed
with
stupid
satisfaction
as
he
listened
to
monsieur
de
balmacheve
.
but
royautt
oblige
and
he
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
as
a
king
and
an
ally
to
confer
on
state
affairs
with
alexanders
envoy
.
he
dis
mounted
took
balashevs
arm
and
moving
a
few
steps
away
from
his
suite
which
waited
respectfully
began
to
pace
up
and
down
with
him
trying
to
speak
significantly
.
he
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
emperor
napoleon
had
re
sented
the
demand
that
he
should
withdraw
his
troops
from
prussia
especially
when
that
demand
became
generally
known
and
the
dig
nity
of
france
was
thereby
offended
.
balashev
replied
that
there
was
nothing
of
fensive
in
the
demand
because

.
but
murat
interrupted
him
.
then
you
dont
consider

emperor

ander

aggressor
he
asked
unexpectedly
with
a
kindly
and
foolish
smile
.

royalty
has
its
obligations
.
balashev
told
him
why
he
considered
napo
leon
to
be
the
originator
of
the
war
.
oh
my
dear
general
murat
again
inter
rupted
him
with
all
my
heart
i
wish
the
em
perors
may
arrange
the
affair
between
them
and
that
the
war
begun
by
no
wish
of
mine
may
finish
as
quickly
as
possiblel
said
he
in
the
tone
of
a
servant
who
wants
to
remain
good
friends
with
another
despite
a
quarrel
between
their
masters
.
and
he
went
on
to
inquiries
about
the
grand
duke
and
the
state
of
his
health
and
to
remi
niscences
of
the
gay
and
amusing
times
he
had
spent
with
him
in
naples
.
then
suddenly
as
if
remembering
his
royal
dignity
murat
sol
emnly
drew
himself
up
assumed
the
pose
in
which
he
had
stood
at
his
coronation
and
wav
ing
his
right
arm
said
i
wont
detain
you
longer
general
.
i
wish
success
to
your
mission
and
with
his
em
broidered
red
mantle
his
flowing
feathers
and
his
glittering
ornaments
he
rejoined
his
suite
who
were
respectfully
awaiting
him
.
balashev
rode
on
supposing
from
murats
words
that
he
would
very
soon
be
brought
be
fore
napoleon
himself
.
but
instead
of
that
at
the
next
village
the
sentinels
of
davouts
in
fantry
corps
detained
him
as
the
pickets
of
the
vanguard
had
done
and
an
adjutant
of
the
corps
commander
who
was
fetched
conducted
him
into
the
village
to
marshal
davout
.
chapter
v
davout
was
to
napoleon
what
arakchdev
was
to
alexander
though
not
a
coward
like
arakchdev
he
was
as
precise
as
cruel
and
as
unable
to
express
his
devotion
to
his
monarch
except
by
cruelty
.
in
the
organism
of
states
such
men
are
nec
essary
as
wolves
are
necessary
in
the
organism
of
nature
and
they
always
exist
always
appear
and
hold
their
own
however
incongruous
their
presence
and
their
proximity
to
the
head
of
the
government
may
be
.
this
inevitability
alone
can
explain
how
the
cruel
arakchev
who
tore
out
a
grenadiers
mustache
with
his
own
hands
whose
weak
nerves
rendered
him
unable
to
face
danger
and
who
was
neither
an
educated
man
nor
a
courtier
was
able
to
maintain
his
powerful
position
with
alexan
der
whose
own
character
was
chivalrous
no
ble
and
gentle
.
balashev
found
davout
seated
on
a
barrel
in
the
shed
of
a
peasants
hut
writing
he
was
auditing
accounts
.
better
quarters
could
have
been
found
him
but
marshal
davout
was
one
35
war
and
peace
of
those
men
who
purposely
put
themselves
in
most
depressing
conditions
to
have
a
justifica
tion
for
being
gloomy
.
for
the
same
reason
they
are
always
hard
at
work
and
in
a
hurry
.
how
can
i
think
of
the
bright
side
of
life
when
as
you
see
i
am
sitting
on
a
barrel
and
working
in
a
dirty
shed
the
expression
of
his
face
seemed
to
say
.
the
chief
pleasure
and
necessity
of
such
men
when
they
encounter
anyone
who
shows
animation
is
to
flaunt
their
own
dreary
persistent
activity
.
davout
allowed
himself
that
pleasure
when
balashev
was
brought
in
.
he
became
still
more
absorbed
in
his
task
when
the
russian
general
entered
and
after
glancing
ove
his
spectacles
at
balashevs
face
which
was
animated
by
the
beauty
of
the
morning
and
by
his
talk
with
murat
he
did
not
rise
or
even
stir
but
scowled
still
more
and
sneered
malevolently
.
when
he
noticed
in
balashevs
face
the
dis
agreeable
impression
this
reception
produced
davout
raised
his
head
and
coldly
asked
what
he
wanted
.
thinking
he
could
have
been
received
in
such
a
manner
only
because
davout
did
not
know
that
he
was
adjutant
general
to
the
em
peror
alexander
and
even
his
envoy
to
napo
leon
balashev
hastened
to
inform
him
of
his
rank
and
mission
.
contrary
to
his
expectation
davout
after
hearing
him
became
still
surlier
and
ruder
.
where
is
your
dispatch
he
inquired
.
give
it
to
me
.
i
will
send
it
to
the
emperor
.
balashev
replied
that
he
had
been
ordered
to
hand
it
personally
to
the
emperor
.
your
emperors
orders
are
obeyed
in
your
army
but
here
said
davout
you
must
do
as
youre
told
.
and
as
if
to
make
the
russian
general
still
more
conscious
of
his
dependence
on
brute
force
davout
sent
an
adjutant
to
call
the
of
ficer
on
duty
.
balashev
took
out
the
packet
containing
the
emperors
letter
and
laid
it
on
the
table
made
of
a
door
with
its
hinges
still
hanging
on
it
laid
across
two
barrels
.
davout
took
the
packet
and
read
the
inscription
.
you
are
perfectly
at
liberty
to
treat
me
with
respect
or
not
protested
balashev
but
per
mit
me
to
observe
that
i
have
the
honor
to
be
adjutant
general
to
his
majesty

davout
glanced
at
him
silently
and
plainly
derived
pleasure
from
the
signs
of
agitation
and
confusion
which
appeared
on
balashevs
face
.
you
will
be
treated
as
is
fitting
said
he
and
putting
the
packet
in
his
pocket
left
the
shed
.
a
minute
later
the
marshals
adjutant
de
castres
came
in
and
conducted
balashev
to
the
quarters
assigned
him
.
that
day
he
dined
with
the
marshal
at
the
same
board
on
the
barrels
.
next
day
davout
rode
out
early
and
after
asking
balashev
to
come
to
him
peremptorily
requested
him
to
remain
there
to
move
on
with
the
baggage
train
should
orders
come
for
it

stood
there
in

though

was

was

at

showed
him
into

balashev
went
into
a
small
reception
room
one
door
of
which
led
into
a
study
the
very
one
from
which
the
russian
emperor
had
dis
patched
him
on
his
mission
.
he
stood
a
minute
or
two
waiting
.
he
heard
hurried
footsteps
beyond
the
door
both
halves
of
it
were
opened
rapidly
all
was
silent
and
then
from
the
study
the
sound
was
heard
of
other
steps
firm
and
resolute
they
were
those
of
napoleon
.
he
had
just
finished
dressing
for
his
ride
and
wore
a
blue
uniform
opening
in
front
over
a
white
waistcoat
so
long
that
it
covered
his
rotund
stomach
white
leather
breeches
tight
ly
fitting
the
fat
thighs
of
his
short
legs
and
hessian
boots
.
his
short
hair
had
evidently
just
been
brushed
but
one
lock
hung
down
in
the
middle
of
his
broad
forehead
.
his
plump
white
neck
stood
out
sharply
above
the
black
collar
of
his
uniform
and
he
smelled
of
eau
de
cologne
.
his
full
face
rather
younglook
ing
with
its
prominent
chin
wore
a
gracious
and
majestic
expression
of
imperial
welcome
.
he
entered
briskly
with
a
jerk
at
every
step
and
his
head
slightly
thrown
back
.
his
whole
short
corpulent
figure
with
broad
thick
shoul
ders
and
chest
and
stomach
involuntarily
pro
truding
had
that
imposing
and
stately
appear
ance
one
sees
in
men
of
forty
who
live
in
com
fort
.
it
was
evident
too
that
he
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
that
day
.
he
nodded
in
answer
to
balashevs
low
and
respectful
bow
and
coming
up
to
him
at
once
began
speaking
like
a
man
who
values
every
moment
of
his
time
and
does
not
condescend
to
prepare
what
he
has
to
say
but
is
sure
he
will
always
say
the
right
thing
and
say
it
well
.
good
day
general
said
he
.
i
have
re
ceived
the
letter
you
brought
from
the
emper
or
alexander
and
am
very
glad
to
see
you
.
he
glanced
with
his
large
eyes
into
balashevs
face
and
immediately
looked
past
him
.
it
was
plain
that
balashevs
personality
did
not
interest
him
at
all
.
evidently
only
what
took
place
within
his
own
mind
interested
him
.
nothing
outside
himself
had
any
significance
for
him
because
everything
in
the
world
it
seemed
to
him
depended
entirely
on
his
will
.
i
do
not
and
did
not
desire
war
he
con
tinued
but
it
has
been
forced
on
me
.
even
now
he
emphasized
the
word
i
am
ready
to
receive
any
explanations
you
can
give
me
.
and
he
began
clearly
and
concisely
to
ex
plain
his
reasons
for
dissatisfaction
with
the
russian
government
.
judging
by
the
calmly
moderate
and
amicable
tone
in
which
the
french
emperor
spoke
balashev
was
firmly
persuaded
that
he
wished
for
peace
and
in
tended
to
enter
into
negotiations
.
when
napoleon
having
finished
speaking
looked
inquiringly
at
the
russian
envoy
bala
shev
began
a
speech
he
had
prepared
long
be
fore
sire
the
emperor
my
master

.

.

.
but
the
sight
of
the
emperors
eyes
bent
on
him
confused
him
.
you
are
flurried
compose
yourself
napoleon
seemed
to
say
as
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
he
looked
at
bala
shevs
uniform
and
sword
.
balashev
recovered
himself
and
began
to
speak
.
he
said
that
the
emperor
alexander
did
not
consider
kurakins
demand
for
his
pass
ports
a
sufficient
cause
for
war
that
kurdkin
had
acted
on
his
own
initiative
and
without
his
sovereigns
assent
that
the
emperor
alex
ander
did
not
desire
war
and
had
no
relations
with
england
.
not
yet
interposed
napoleon
and
as
if
fearing
to
give
vent
to
his
feelings
he
frowned
and
nodded
slightly
as
a
sign
that
balashev
might
proceed
.
after
saying
all
he
had
been
instructed
to
say
balashev
added
that
the
emperor
alex
ander
wished
for
peace
but
would
not
enter
into
negotiations
except
on
condition
that

.

.

.
here
balashev
hesitated
he
remembered
the
words
the
emperor
alexander
had
not
writ
ten
in
his
letter
but
had
specially
inserted
in
the
rescript
to
saltyk6v
and
had
told
balashev
to
repeat
to
napoleon
.
balashev
remembered
these
words
so
long
as
a
single
armed
foe
re
mains
on
russian
soil
but
some
complex
feel
ing
restrained
him
.
he
could
not
utter
them
though
he
wished
to
do
so
.
he
grew
confused
and
said
on
condition
that
the
french
army
retires
beyond
the
niemen
.

napoleon
noticed
balashevs
embarrassment
when
uttering
these
last
words
hfc
face
twitched
and
the
calf
of
his
left
leg
began
to
quiver
rhyth
mically
.
without
moving
from
where
he
stood
he
began
speaking
in
a
louder
tone
and
more
hurriedly
than
before
.
during
the
speech
that
followed
balashev
who
more
than
once
low
ered
his
eyes
involuntarily
noticed
the
quiver
ing
of
napoleons
left
leg
which
increased
the

his
voice

napoleon
turned
quickly
and
began
to
pace
the
room
.
you
say
the
demand
now
is
that
i
am
to
withdraw
beyond
the
niemen
before
com
mencing

but
in
just

the
demand
was
that
i

yet
you

he
went
in
silence
from
one
corner
of
the
room
to
the
other
and
again
stopped
in
front
of
balashev
.
balashev
noticed
that
his
left
leg
was
quivering
faster
than
before
and
his
face
seemed
petrified
in
its
stern
expression
.
this
quivering
of
his
left
leg
was
a
thing
napoleon
was
conscious
of
.
the
vibration
of
my
left
calf
is
a

remarked
at
a
later
date

screamed
quite
to
his
own
surprise
.

you
offer
me
negotiations
but
what
is
the
aim
of
your
alliance
with
eng
land
what
has
she
given
you
he
continued
hurriedly
evidently
no
longer
trying
to
show
the
advantages
of
peace
and
discuss
its
possibil
ity
but
only
to
prove
his
own
rectitude
and
power
and
alexanders
errors
and
duplicity
.
the
commencement
of
his
speech
had
ob
viously
been
made
with
the
in
tendon
of
demon
strating
the
advantages
of
his
position
and
showing
that
he
was
nevertheless
willing
to
ne
gotiate
.
but
he
had
begun
talking
and
the
more
he
talked
the
less
could
he
control
his
words
.
the
whole
purport
of
his
remarks
now
was
evidently
to
exalt
himself
and
insult
alexander
just
what
he
had
least
desired
at
the
com
i
hear
you
have
made
peace
with

balashev
bowed
his
head
affirmatively
.
peace
has
been
concluded

..
.
he
began
.
but
napoleon
did
not
let
him
speak
.
he
evi
dently
wanted
to
do
all
the
talking
himself
and
continued
to
talk
with
the
sort
of
elo
quence
and
unrestrained
irritability
to
which
spoiled
people
are
so
prone
.
yes
i
know
you
have
made
peace
with
the
turks
without
obtaining
moldavia
and
wal
lachia
i
would
have
given
your
sovereign
those
provinces
as
i
gave
him

yes
he
went
on
i
promised
and
would
have
given
the
emperor
alexander
moldavia
and
walla
chia
and
now
he
wont
have
those
splendid
provinces
.
yet
he
might
have
united
them
to
his
empire
and
in
a
single
reign
would
have
extended
russia
from
the
gulf
of

to
the

of

napoleon
growing
more
and
more
excited
as
he
paced
up
and
down

the
very
words

had
used

all
that
he
would

repeated
several
times
then
paused
drew
from
his
pocket
a
gold
snuffbox
lifted
it
to
his
nose
and
greedily
sniffed
at
it
.
what
a

he
looked
compassionately
at
balashev
and
as
soon
as
the

tried
to
make

him

as
for
the
swedes
it
is
their
fate
to
be
governed
by
mad
kings
.
their
king
was
insane
and
they
changed
him
for
an
other
bernadotte
who
promptly
went
mad
for
no
swede
would
ally
himself
with
russia
unless
he
were
mad
.
napoleon
grinned
maliciously
and
again
raised
his
snuffbox
to
his
nose
.
balashev
knew
how
to
reply
to
each
of
na
poleons
remarks
and
would
have
done
so
he
continually
made
the
gesture
of
a
man
wishing
to
say
something
but
napoleon
always
inter
rupted
him
.
to
the
alleged
insanity
of
the
swedes
balashev
wished
to
reply
that
when
russia
is
on
her
side
sweden
is
practically
an
island
but
napoleon
gave
an
angry
exclama
tion
to
drown
his
voice
.
napoleon
was
in
that
state
of
irritability
in
which
a
man
has
to
talk
talk
and
talk
merely
to
convince
himself
that
he
is
in
the
right
.
balashev
began
to
feel
un
comfortable
as
envoy
he
feared
to
demean
his
dignity
and
felt
the
necessity
of
replying
but
as
a
man
he
shrank
before
the
transport
of
groundless
wrath
that
had
evidently
seized
na
poleon
.
he
knew
that
none
of
the
words
now
uttered
by
napoleon
had
any
significance
and
that
napoleon
himself
would
be
ashamed
of
them
when
he
came
to
his
senses
.
balashev
stood
with
downcast
eyes

at
the
move

of
napoleons
stout

and
trying
to
avoid
meeting
his
eyes
.
but
what
do
i
care
about
your
allies
said
napoleon
.
i
have
allies
the
poles
.
there
are
eighty
thousand
of
them
and
they
fight
like
lions
.
and
there
will
be
two
hundred
thousand
of
them
.
and
probably
still
more
perturbed
by
the
fact
that
he
had
uttered
this
obvious
falsehood
and
that
balashev
still
stood
silently
before
him
in
the
same
attitude
of
submission
to
fate
napoleon
abruptly
turned
round
drew
close
to
balashevs
face
and
gesticulating
rapidly
and
energetically
with
his
white
hands
almost
shouted
know
that
if
you
stir
up
prussia
against
me
ill
wipe
it
off
the
map
of
europe
hedeclared
his
face
pale
and
distorted
by
anger
and
he
struck
one
of
hissmall
hands
energetically
with
the
other
.
yes
i
will
throw
you
back
beyond
the
dvina
and
beyond
the
dnieper
and
will
reerect
against
you
that
barrier

which
it
was
criminal
and
blind
of
europe
to
allow
to
be
de
stroyed
.
yes
that
is
what
will
happen
to
you
.
that
is
what
you
have
gained
by
alienating
me
and
he
walked
silently
several
times
up
and
down
the
room
his
fat
shoulders
twitch
ing
.
he
put
his
snuffbox
into
his
waistcoat
pock
et
took
it
out
again
lifted
it
several
times
to
his
nose
and
stopped
in
front
of
balashev
.
he
paused
looked
ironically
straight
into
bala
shevs
eyes
and
said
in
a
quiet
voice
and
yet
what
a
splendid
reign
your
master
might
have
had
balashev
feeling
it
incumbent
on
him
to
re
ply
said
that
from
the
russian
side
things
did
not
appear
in
so
gloomy
a
light
.
napoleon
was
silent
still
looking
derisively
at
him
and
evi
dently
not
listening
to
him
.
balashev
said
that
in
russia
the
best
results
were
expected
from
the
war
.
napoleon
nodded
condescendingly
as
if
to
say
i
know
its
your
duty
to
say
that
but
you
dont
believe
it
yourself
.
i
have
convinced

war
and

when
balashev
had
ended
napoleon
again
took
out
his
snuffbox
sniffed
at
it
and
stamped
his
foot
twice
on
the
floor
as
a
signal
.
the
door
opened
a

bending
re
spectfully
handed
the

his
hat
and

.
napoleon
without
giving
them
a
glance
turned
to
balashev
assure
the
emperor
alexander
from
me
said
he
taking
his
hat
that
i
am
as
devoted
to
him
as
before
i
know
him
thoroughly
and
very
highly
esteem
his
lofty
qualities
.
i

tain

and
napoleon
went
quickly
to
the
door
.
ev
eryone
in
the
reception
room
rushed
forward
and
descended
the
staircase
.
vii
after
all
that
napoleon
had
said
to
him
those
bursts
of
anger
and
the
last
dryly
spoken
words
i
will
detain
you
no
longer
general
you
shall
receive
my
letter
balashev
felt
con
vinced
that
napoleon
would
not
wish
to
see
him
and
would
even
avoid
another
meeting
with
him
an
insulted
envoy
especially
as
he
had
witnessed
his
unseemly
anger
.
but
to
his
surprise
balashev
received
through
duroc
an
invitation
to
dine
with
the
emperor
that
day
.
bessires
caulaincourt
and
berthier
were
present
at
that
dinner
.
napoleon
met
balashev
cheerfully
and
ami
ably
.
he
not
only
showed
no
sign
of
constraint
or
selfreproach
on
account
of
his
outburst
that
morning
but
on
the
contrary
tried
to
reas
sure
balashev
.
it
was
evident
that
he
had
long
been
convinced
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
make
a
mistake
and
that
in
his
perception
whatever
he
did
was
right
not
because
it
har
monized
with
any
idea
of
right
and
wrong
but
because
he
did
it
.
the
emperor
was
in
very
good
spirits
after
his
ride
through
vilna
where
crowds
of
peo
ple
had
rapturously
greeted
and
followed
him
.
from
all
the
windows
of
the
streets
through
which
he
rode
rugs
flags
and
his
monogram
were
displayed
and
the
polish
ladies
welcom
ing
him
waved
their
handkerchiefs
to
him
.
at
dinner
having
placed
balashev
beside
him
napoleon
not
only
treated
him
amiably
but
behaved
as
if
balashev
were
one
of
his
own
courtiers
one
of
those
who
sympathized
with
his
plans
and
ought
to
rejoice
at
his
success
.
in
the
course
of
conversation
he
mentioned
mos
cow
and
questioned
balashev
about
the
rus
sian
capital
not
merely
as
an
interested
trav
eler
asks
about
a
new
city
he
intends
to
visit
but
as
if
convinced
that
balashev
as
a
russian
must
be
flattered
by
his
curiosity
.
how
many
inhabitants
are
there
in
mos
cow
how
many
houses
is
it
true
that
moscow
is
called
holy
moscow
how
many
churches
are
there
in
moscow
he
asked
.
and
receiving
the
reply
that
there
were
more
than
two
hundred
churches
he
remarked
why
such
a
quantity
of
churches
the
russians
are
very
devout
replied
bal
ashev
.
but
a
large
number
of
monasteries
and
churches
is
always
a
sign
of
the
backwardness
of
a
people
said
napoleon
turning
to
cau
laincourt
for
appreciation
of
this
remark
.
balashev
respectfully
ventured
to
disagree
with
the
french
emperor
.
every
country
has
its
own
character
said
he
.
but
nowhere
in
europe
is
there
anything
like
that
said
napoleon
.
i
beg
your
majestys
pardon
returned
bal
ashev
besides
russia
there
is
spain
where
there
are
also
many
churches
and
monasteries
.
this
reply
of
balashevs
which
hinted
at
the
recent
defeats
of
the
french
in
spain
was
much
appreciated
when
he
related
it
at
alex
anders
court
but
it
was
not
much
appreciated
at
napoleons
dinner
where
it
passed
unno
ticed
.
the
uninterested
and
perplexed
faces
of
the
marshals
showed
that
they
were
puzzled
as
to
what
balashevs
tone
suggested
.
if
there
is
a
point
we
dont
see
it
or
it
is
not
at
all
witty
their
expressions
seemed
to
say
.
so
little
was
his
rejoinder
appreciated
that
napoleon
did
not
notice
it
at
all
and
naively
asked
balashev
through
what
towns
the
direct
road
from
there
to
moscow
passed
.
balashev
who
was
on
the
alert
all
through
the
dinner
replied
that
just
as
all
roads
lead
to
rome
so
all
roads
lead
to
moscow
there
were
many
roads
and
among
them
the
road
through
poltdva
which
charles
xii
chose
.
balashev
involuntarily
flushed
with
pleasure
at
the
aptitude
of
this
reply
but
hardly
had
he
uttered
the
word
poltdva
before
caulaincourt
began
speaking
of
the
badness
of
the
road
from
petersburg
to
moscow
and
of
his
petersburg
reminiscences
.
after
dinner
they
went
to
drink
coffee
in
na
poleons
study
which
four
days
previously
had
been
that
of
the
emperor
alexander
.
napole
on
sat
down
toying
with
his
svres
coffee
cup
and
motioned
balashev
to
a
chair
beside
him
.
napoleon
was
in
that
wellknown
afterdin
book
nine
s55
ner
mood
which
more
than
any
reasoned
cause
makes
a
man
contented
with
himself
and
dis
posed
to
consider
everyone
his
friend
.
itseemed
to
him
that
he
was
surrounded
by
men
who
adored
him
and
he
felt
convinced
that
after
his
dinner
balashev
too
was
his
friend
and
wor
shiper
.
napoleon
turned
to
him
with
a
pleas
ant
though
slightly
ironic
smile
.
they
tell
me
this
is
the
room
the
emperor
alexander
occupied
strange
isnt
it
gener
al
he
said
evidently
not
doubting
that
this
remark
would
be
agreeable
to
his
hearer
since
it
went
to
prove
his
napoleons
superiority
to
alexander
.
balashev
could
make
no
reply
and
bowed
his
head
in
silence
.
yes
.
four
days
ago
in
this
room
wintzing

and

were
deliberating
continued
napoleon
with
the
same
derisive
and
selfcon
fident
smile
.
what
i
cant
understand
he
went
on
is
that
the
emperor

has
surrounded
himself
with

personal

has
he
not
thought
that
i
may
do

he
turned
inquiringly
to
balashev
and
evidently
this
thought
turned
him
back
on
to
the
track
of
his
mornings
anger
which
was
still
fresh
in
him
.
and
let
him
know
that
i

.

.
yes
.
ill

out

let
him

asylum

in
russial
balashev
bowed
his
head
with
an
air
indicat
ing
that
he
would
like
to
make
his
bow
and
leave
and
only
listened
because
he
could
not
help
hearing
what
was
said
to
him
.
napoleon
did
not
notice
this
expression
he
treated
bal
ashev
not
as
an
envoy
from
his
enemy
but
as
a
man
now
fully
devoted
to
him
and
who
must
rejoice
at
his
former
masters
humiliation
.
and
why
has
the
emperor
alexander
taken
command
of
the
armies
what
is
the
good
of
that
war
is
my
profession
but
his
business
is
to
reign
and
not
to
command
armies
1
why
has
he
taken
on
himself
such
a
responsibility
again
napoleon
brought
out
his
snuffbox
paced
several
times
up
and
down
the
room
in
silence
and
then
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
went
up
to
balashev
and
with
a
slight
smile
as
confidently
quickly
and
simply
as
if
he
were
doing
something
not
merely
important
but
pleasing
to
balashev
he
raised
his
hand
to
the
fortyyearold
russian
generals
face
and
tak
ing
him
by
the
ear
pulled
it
gently
smiling
with

to

chapter
viii
after
his
interview
with
pierre
in
moscow
prince
andrew
went
to
petersburg
on
business
as
he
told
his
family
bufirdrttyeet
ana
tole
kurdgin
whom
he
felt
it
necessary
to
en
counter
.
on
reaching
petersburg
he
inquired
for
kuragin
but
the
latter
had
already
left
the
city
.
pierre
had
warned
his
brotherinlaw
that
prince
andrew
was
on
his
track
.
anatole
kura
gin
promptly
obtained
an
appointment
from
the
minister
of
war
and
went
to
join
the
army
in
moldavia
.
while
in
petersburg
prince
an
drew
met
kutiizov
his
former
commander
who
was
always
well
disposed
toward
him
and
ku
tiizov
suggested
that
he
should
accompany
him
to
the
army
in
moldavia
to
which
the
old
gen
eral
had
been
appointed
commander
in
chief
.
so
prince
andrew
having
received
an
appoint
ment
on
the
headquarters
staff
left
for
turkey
.
prince
andrew
did
not
think
it
proper
to
write
and
challenge
kurdgin
.
he
thought
that
if
he
challenged
him
without
some
fresh
cause
it
might
compromise
the
young
countess
ros
t6va
and
so
he
wanted
to
meet
kurdgin
per
sonally
in
order
to
find
a
fresh
pretext
for
a
duel
.
but
he
again
failed
to
meet
kuragin
in
turkey
for
soon
after
prince
andrew
arrived
the
latter
re
turned
to
russia
.
in
a
new
country
amid
new
conditions
prince
andrew
found
life
easier
to
bear
.
after
his
betrothed
had
brok
en
faith
with
him
which
he
felt
the
more
a
cutely
the
more
he
tried
to
conceal
its
effects
the
surroundings
in
which
he
had
been
happy
became
trying
to
him
and
the
freedom
and
in
dependence
he
had
once
prized
so
highly
were
still
more
so
.
not
only
could
he
no
longer
think
the
thoughts
that
had
first
come
to
him
as
he
lay
gazing
at
the
sky
on
the
field
of
austerlitz
and
had
later
enlarged
upon
with
pierre
and
which
had
filled
his
solitude
at
boguchdrovo
356
war
and
peace
and
then
in
switzerland
and
rome
but
he
even
dreaded
to
recall
them
and
the
bright
and
boundless
horizons
they
had
revealed
.
he
was
now
concerned
only
with
the
nearest
practical
matters
unrelated
to
his
past
interests
and
he
seized
on
these
the
more
eagerly
the
more
those
past
interests
were
closed
to
him
.
it
was
as
if
that
lofty
infinite
canopy
of
heaven
that
had
once
towered
above
him
had
suddenly
turned
into
a
low
solid
vault
that
weighed
him
down
in
which
all
was
clear
but
nothing
eternal
or
mysterious
.
of
the
activities
that
presented
themselves
to
him
army
service
was
the
simplest
and
most
familiar
.
as
a
general
on
duty
on
kutuzovs
staff
he
applied
himself
to
business
with
zeal
and
perseverance
and
surprised
kutiizov
by
his
willingness
and
accuracy
in
work
.
not
having
found
kuragin
in
turkey
prince
andrew
did
not
thinkjjqxik
to
rush
back
to
russia
after
him
but
all
the
sime
he
knew
that
how
ever
long
it
might
be
before
he
met
kurgin
despite
his
contempt
for
him
and
despite
all
the
proofs
he
deduced
to
convince
himself
that
it
was
not
worth
stooping
to
a
conflict
with
him
he
knew
that
when
he
did
meet
him
he
would
not
be
able
to
resist
calling
him
out
any
more
than
a
ravenous
man
can
help
snatching
at
food
.
and
the
consciousness
that
the
insult
was
not
yet
avenged
that
his
rancor
was
still
un
spent
weighed
on
his
heart
and
poisoned
the
artificial
tranquillity
which
he
managed
to
ob
tain
in
turkey
by
means
of
restless
plodding
and
rather
vainglorious
and
ambitious
activity
.
i
n
the
year
1812
when
news
of
the
war
with
napoleon
reached
bucharest
where
kutuov
had
been
living
for
two
months
passing
his
days
and
nights
with
a
wallachian
woman
prince
andrew
asked
kutiizov
to
transfer
him
to
the
western
army
.
kutuzov
who
was
al
ready
weary
of
bolk6nskis
activity
which
seemed
to
reproach
his
own
idleness
very
read
ily
let
him
go
and
gave
him
a
mission
to
bar
clay
de
tolly
.
before
joining
the
western
army
which
was
then
in
may
encamped
at
drissa
prince
an
drew
visited
bald
hills
which
was
directly
on
his
way
being
only
two
miles
off
the
smolensk
highroad
.
during
the
last
three
years
there
had
been
so
many
changes
in
his
life
he
had
thought
felt
and
seen
so
much
having
traveled
both
in
the
east
and
the
west
that
on
reaching
bald
hills
it
struck
him
as
strange
and
unexpected
to
find
the
way
of
life
there
unchanged
and
still
the
same
in
every
detail
.
he
entered
through
the
gates
with
their
stone
pillars
and
drove
up
the
avenue
leading
to
the
house
as
if
he
were
entering
an
enchanted
sleeping
castle
.
the
same
old
stateliness
the
same
cleanliness
the
same
stillness
reigned
there
and
inside
there
was
the
same
furniture
the
same
walls
sounds
and
smell
and
the
same
timid
faces
only
some
what
older
.
princess
mary
was
still
the
same
tim
id
plain
maiden
getting
on
in
years
uselessly
and
joylessly
passing
the
bestyearsof
her
life
in
fearand
constant
suffering
.
mademoiselle
bou
rienne
was
the
same
coquettish
selfsatisfied
girl
enjoying
every
moment
of
her
existence
and
full
of
joyous
hopes
for
the
future
.
she
had
merely
become
more
selfconfident
prince
andrew
thought
.
dessalles
the
tutor
he
had
brought
from
switzerland
was
wearing
a
coat
of
russian
cut
and
talking
broken
russian
to
the
servants
but
was
still
the
same
narrowly
in
telligent
conscientious
and
pedantic
precep
tor
.
the
old
prince
had
changed
in
appearance
only
by
the
loss
of
a
tooth
which
left
a
notice
able
gap
on
one
side
of
his
mouth
in
character
he
was
the
same
as
ever
only
showing
still
more
irritability
and
skepticism
as
to
what
was
hap
pening
in
the
world
.
little
nicholas
alone
had
changed
.
he
had
grown
become
rosier
had
curly
dark
hair
and
when
merry
and
laugh
ing
quite
unconsciously
lifted
the
upper
lip
of
his
pretty
little
mouth
just
as
the
little
prin
cess
used
to
do
.
he
alone
did
not
obey
the
law
of
immutability
in
the
enchanted
sleeping
cas
tle
.
but
though
externally
all
remained
as
of
old
the
inner
relations
of
all
these
people
had
changed
since
prince
andrew
had
seen
them
last
.
the
household
was
divided
into
two
alien
and
hostile
camps
who
changed
their
habits
for
his
sake
and
only
met
because
he
was
there
.
to
the
one
camp
belonged
the
old
prince
mad
moiselle
bourienne
and
the
architect
to
the
other
princess
mary
dessalles
little
nicholas
and
all
the
old
nurses
and
maids
.
during
his
stay
at
bald
hills
all
the
family
dined
together
but
they
were
ill
at
ease
and
prince
andrew
felt
that
he
was
a
visitor
for
whose
sake
an
exception
was
being
made
and
that
his
presence
made
them
all
feel
awkward
.
involuntarily
feeling
this
at
dinner
on
the
first
day
he
was
taciturn
and
the
old
prince
noticing
this
also
became
morosely
dumb
and
retired
to
his
apartments
directly
after
dinner
.
in
the
evening
when
prince
andrew
went
to
him
and
trying
to
rouse
him
began
to
tell
him
of
the
young
count
kmenskys
campaign
the
old
prince
began
unexpectedly
to
talk
about
princess
mary
blaming
her
for
her
superstitions
and
her
dislike
of
mademoiselle
book
bourienne
who
he
said
was
the
only
person
really
attached
to
him
.
the
old
prince
said
that
if
he
was
ill
it
was
only
because
of
princess
mary
that
she
pur
posely
worried
and
irritated
him
and
that
by
indulgence
and
silly
talk
she
was
spoiling
little
prince
nicholas
.
the
old
prince
knew
very
well
that
he
tormented
his
daughter
and
that
her
life
was
very
hard
but
he
also
knew
that
he
could
not
help
tormenting
her
and
that
she
de
served
it
.
why
does
prince
andrew
who
sees
this
say
nothing
to
me
about
his
sister
docs
he
think
me
a
scoundrel
or
an
old
fool
who
without
any
reason
keeps
his
own
daughter
at
a
distance
and
attaches
this
frenchwoman
to
himself
he
doesnt
understand
so
i
must
ex
plain
it
and
hemust
hearme
out
thought
the
old
prince
.
and
he
began
explaining
why
he
could
not
put
up
with
his
daughters
unreason
able
character
.
if
you
ask
me
said
prince
andrew
with
out
looking
up
he
was
censuring
his
father
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
i
did
not
wish
to
speak
about
it
but
as
you
ask
me
1
will
give
you
niy
frank
opinion
.
if
there
is
any
misun
derstanding
a
nd
discord
between
you
a
nd
mary
i
cant
blame
her
for
it
at
all
.
1
know
how
she
loves
and
respects
you
.
since
you
ask
me
continued
prince
andrew
becoming
irritable
as
he
was
always
liable
to
do
of
late
i
can
only
say
that
if
there
are
any
misunderstand
ings
they
are
caused
by
that
worthless
woman
who
is
not
fit
to
be
my
sisters
companion
.
the
old
man
at
first
stared
fixedly
at
his
son
and
an
unnatural
smile
disclosed
the
fresh
gap
between
his
teeth
to
which
prince
andrew
could
not
get
accustomed
.
what
companion
my
dear
boy
eh
youve
already
been
talking
it
over
eh
father
i
did
not
want
to
judge
said
prince
andrew
in
a
hard
and
bitter
tone
but
you
challenged
me
and
i
have
said
and
always
shall
say
that
mary
is
not
to
blame
but
ihose
to
blamethe
one
to
blame
is
that
french
woman
.
ah
he
has
passed
judgment

.

.

.
passed
judg
ment
said
the
old
man
in
a
low
voice
and
as
it
seemed
to
prince
andrew
with
some
embar
rassment
but
then
he
suddenly
jumped
up
and
cried
be
off
be
off
let
not
a
trace
of
you
re
main
here

.

.

.
prince
andrew
wished
to
leave
at
once
but
princess
mary
persuaded
him
to
stay
another
day
.
that
day
he
did
not
see
his
father
who
did
not
leave
his
room
and
admitted
no
one
nine
357
but
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
tikhon
but
asked
several
times
whether
his
son
had
gone
.
next
day
before
leaving
prince
andrew
went
to
his
sons
rooms
.
the
boy
curlyheaded
like
his
mother
and
glowing
with
health
sat
on
his
knee
and
prince
andrew
began
telling
him
the
story
of
bluebeard
but
fell
into
a
reverie
without
finishing
the
story
.
he
thought
not
of
this
pretty
child
his
son
whom
he
held
on
his
knee
but
of
himself
.
he
sought
in
himself
ei
ther
remorse
for
having
angered
his
father
or
regret
at
leaving
home
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
on
bad
terms
with
him
and
was
horrified
to
find
neither
.
what
meant
still
more
to
him
was
that
he
sought
and
did
not
find
in
himself
the
former
tenderness
for
his
son
which
he
had
hoped
to
reawaken
by
caressing
the
boy
and
taking
him
on
his
knee
.
well
go
on
said
r

.vstfnjiiowil
prince
andrew
witnout
replyirfgv
put
him
down
from
his
knee
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
as
soon
as
prince
andrew
had
given
up
his
daily
occupations
and
especially
on
returning
to
the
old
conditions
of
life
amid
which
he
had
been
happy
weariness
of
life
overcame
him
with
its
former
intensity
and
he
hastened
to
escape
from
these
memories
and
to
find
some
work
as
soon
as
possible
.
so
youve
decided
to
go
andrew
asked
his
sister
.
thank
god
that
i
can
replied
prince
an
drew
.
1
am
very
sorry
you
cant
.
why
do
you
say
that
replied
princess
mary
.
why
do
you
say
that
when
you
are
go
ing
to
this
terrible
war
and
he
is
so
old
made
moiselle
bourienne
says
he
has
been
asking
about
you
.

..
.
as
soon
as
she
began
to
speak
of
that
her
lips
trembled
and
her
tears
began
to
fall
.
prince
andrew
turned
away
and
began
pacing
the
room
.
ah
my
god
my
god
when
one
thinks
who
and
what
what
trash
can
cause
people
misery
he
said
with
a
malignity
that
alarmed
princess
mary
.
she
understood
that
when
speakingof
trash
he
referred
not
only
to
mademoiselle
bouri
enne
the
cause
of
her
misery
but
also
to
the
man
who
had
ruined
his
own
happiness
.
andrew
one
thing
i
beg
i
entreat
of
you
she
said
touching
his
elbow
and
looking
at
him
with
eyes
that
shone
through
her
tears
.
1
understand
you
she
looked
down
.
dont
imagine
that
sorrow
is
the
work
of
men
.
meri
are
his
tools
.
she
looked
a
little
above
prince
andrews
head
with
the
confident
accustomed
war
and
peace
look
with
which
one
looks
at
the
place
where
a
familiar
portrait
hangs
.
sorrow
is
sent
by
him
not
by
men
.
men
are
his
instruments
they
are
not
to
blame
.
ii
you
think
someone
has
wronged
you
forget
it
and
forgivel
we
have
no
right
to
punish
.
and
then
you
will
know
the
happiness
of
forgiving
.
if
i
were
a
woman
i
would
do
so
mary
.
that
is
a
womans
virtue
.
but
a
man
should
not
and
cannot
forgive
and
forget
he
replied
and
though
till
that
moment
he
had
not
been
thinking
of
kuragin
all
his
unexpended
anger
suddenly
swelled
up
in
his
heart
.
if
mary
is
already
persuading
me
to
forgive
it
means
that
i
ought
longago
to
have
punished
him
he
thought
.
and
giving
her
no
further
reply
he
began
thinking
of
the
glad
vindictive
moment
when
he
would
meet
kuriigin
who
he
knew
y
w
fee
my
.
princcivmary
beggecj
him
to
stay
one
day
more
saying
that
she
kilw
how
unhappy
her
father
would
be
if
andrev
left
without
being
reconciled
to
him
but
prince
andrew
replied
that
he
would
probably
soon
be
back
again
from
the
army
and
would
certainly
write
to
his
father
but
that
the
longer
he
stayed
now
the
more
embittered
their
differences
would
be
come
.
goodby
andrew
remember
that
misfor
tunes
come
from
god
and
men
are
never
to
blame
were
the
last
words
he
heard
from
his
sister
when
he
took
leave
of
her
.
then
it
must
be
so
thought
prince
an
drew
as
he
drove
out
of
the
avenue
from
the
house
at
bald
hills
.
she
poor
innocent
crea
ture
is
left
to
be
victimized
by
an
old
man
who
has
outlived
his
wits
.
the
old
man
feels
he
is
guilty
but
cannot
change
himself
.
my
boy
is
growing
up
and
rejoices
in
life
in
which
like
everybody
else
he
will
deceive
or
be
deceived
.
and
i
am
off
to
the
army
.
why
i
myself
dont
know
.
i
want
to
meet
that
man
whom
i
despise
so
as
to
give
him
a
chance
to
kill
and
laugh
at
me
these
conditions
of
life
had
been
the
same
before
but
then
they
were
all
connected
while
now
they
had
all
tumbled
to
pieces
.
only
senseless
things
lacking
coherence
presented
themselves
one
after
another
to
prince
an
drews
mind
.
chapter
ix
prince
andrew
reached
the
general
headquar
ters
of
the
army
at
the
end
of
june
.
the
first
army
with
which
was
the
emperor
occupied
the
fortified
camp
at
drissa
the
second
army
was
retreating
trying
to
effect
a
junction
with
the
first
one
from
which
it
was
said
to
be
cut
off
by
large
french
forces
.
everyone
was
dissatis
fied
with
the
general
course
of
affairs
in
the
russian
army
but
no
one
anticipated
any
dan
ger
of
invasion
of
the
russian
provinces
and
no
one
thought
the
war
would
extend
farther
than
the
western
the
polish
provinces
.
prince
andrew
found
barclay
de
tolly
to
whom
he
had
been
assigned
on
the
bank
of
the
drissa
.
as
there
was
not
a
single
town
or
large
village
in
the
vicinity
of
the
camp
the
immense
number
ot
generals
and
courtiers
ac
companying
the
army
were
living
in
the
best
houses
of
the
villages
on
both
sides
of
the
river
over
a
radius
of
six
miles
.
barclay
de
tolly
was
quartered
nearly
three
miles
from
the
emperor
.
he
received
bolkonski
stiflly
and
coldly
and
told
him
in
his
foreign
accent
that
he
would
mention
him
to
the
emperor
for
a
decision
as
to
his
employment
but
asked
him
meanwhile
to
remain
on
his
staff
.
anatole
kuragin
whom
prince
andrew
had
hoped
to
find
with
the
ar
my
was
not
there
.
he
had
gone
to
petersburg
but
prince
andrew
was
glad
to
hear
this
.
his
mind
was
occupied
by
the
interests
of
the
cen
ter
that
was
conducting
a
gigantic
war
and
he
was
glad
to
be
free
for
a
while
from
the
distrac
tion
caused
by
the
thought
of
kuragin
.
dur
ing
the
first
four
days
while
no
duties
were
re
quired
of
him
prince
andrew
rode
round
the
whole
fortified
camp
and
by
the
aid
of
his
own
knowledge
and
by
talks
with
experts
tried
to
form
a
definite
opinion
about
it
.
but
the
ques
tion
whether
the
camp
was
advantageous
or
disadvantageous
remained
for
him
undecided
.
already
from
his
military
experience
and
what
he
had
seen
in
the
austrian
campaign
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
in
war
the
most
deeply
considered
plans
have
no
significance
and
that
all
depends
on
the
way
unexpected
movements
of
the
enemy
that
cannot
be
fore
seenare
met
and
on
how
and
by
whom
the
whole
matter
is
handled
.
to
clear
up
this
last
point
for
hiiqself
prince
andrew
utilizing
his
position
and
acquaintances
tried
to
fathom
the
character
of
the
control
of
the
army
arid
of
the
men
and
parties
engaged
in
it
and
he
de
duced
for
himself
the
following
idea
of
the
state
of
affairs
.
while
the
emperor
had
still
been
at
vflna
the
forces
had
been
divided
into
three
armies
.
first
the
army
under
barclay
de
tolly
second
ly
the
army
under
bagrati6n
and
thirdly
the
one
commanded
by
tormdsov
.
the
emperor
was
with
the
first
army
but
not
as
commander
book
nine
359
in
chief
.
in
the
orders
issued
it
was
stated
not
that
the
emperor
would
take
command
but
only
that
he
would
be
with
the
army
.
the
em
peror
moreover
had
with
him
not
a
command
er
in
chiefs
staff
but
the
imperial
headquarters
staff
.
in
attendance
on
him
was
the
head
of
the
imperial
staff
quartermaster
general
prince
volkonski
as
well
as
generals
imperial
aides
decamp
diplomatic
officials
and
a
large
num
ber
of
foreigners
but
not
the
army
staff
.
besides
these
there
were
in
attendance
on
the
emperor
without
any
definite
appointments
arakchev
the
exminister
of
war
count
bcn
nigsen
the
senior
general
in
rank
the
grand
duketsardvich
constantine
pavlovich
count
rumydntsev
the
chancellor
stein
a
former
prussian
minister
armfeldt
a
swedish
gener
al
pfuel
the
chief
author
of
the
plan
of
cam
paign
paulucci
an
adjutant
general
and
sar
dinian
emigrd
wolzogen
and
many
others
.
though
these
men
had
no
military
appoint
ment
in
the
army
their
position
gave
them
in
fluence
and
often
a
corps
commander
or
even
the
commander
in
chief
did
not
know
in
what
capacity
he
was
questioned
by
bennigsen
the
grand
duke
arakchdev
or
prince
volkonski
or
was
given
this
or
that
advice
and
did
not
know
whether
a
certain
order
received
in
the
form
of
advice
emanated
from
the
man
who
gave
it
or
from
the
emperor
and
whether
it
had
to
be
ex
ecuted
or
not
.
but
this
was
only
the
external
condition
the
essential
significance
of
the
presence
of
the
emperor
and
of
all
these
peo
ple
from
a
courtiers
point
of
view
and
in
an
emperors
vicinity
all
became
courtiers
was
clear
to
everyone
.
it
was
this
the
emperor
did
not
assume
the
title
of
commander
in
chief
but
disposed
of
all
the
armies
the
men
around
him
were
his
assistants
.
arakchev
was
a
faithful
custodian
to
enforce
order
and
acted
as
the
sov
ereigns
bodyguard
.
bennigsen
was
a
landlord
in
the
vilna
province
who
appeared
to
be
do
ing
the
honors
of
the
district
but
was
in
real
ity
a
good
general
useful
as
an
adviser
and
ready
at
hand
to
replace
barclay
.
the
grand
duke
was
there
because
it
suited
him
to
be
.
the
exminister
stein
was
there
because
his
advice
was
useful
and
the
emperor
alexander
held
him
in
high
esteem
personally
.
armfeldt
viru
lently
hated
napoleon
and
was
a
general
full
of
selfconfidence
a
quality
that
always
influ
enced
alexander
.
paulucci
was
there
because
he
was
bold
and
decided
in
speech
.
the
adju
tants
general
were
there
because
they
always
accompanied
the
emperor
and
lastly
and
chief
ly
pfuel
was
there
because
he
had
drawn
up
the
plan
of
campaign
against
napoleon
and
having
induced
alexander
to
believe
in
the
efficacy
of
that
plan
was
directing
the
whole
business
of
the
war
.
with
pfuel
was
wolzogen
who
expressed
pfuels
thoughts
in
a
more
com
prehensible
way
than
pfuel
himself
who
was
a
harsh
bookish
theorist
selfconfident
to
the
point
of
despising
everyone
else
was
able
to
do
.
besides
these
russians
and
foreigners
who
propounded
new
and
unexpected
ideas
every
day
especially
the
foreigners
who
did
so
with
a
boldness
characteristic
of
people
employed
in
a
country
not
their
own
there
were
many
sec
ondary
personages
accompanying
the
army
be
cause
their
principals
were
there
.
among
the
opinions
and
voices
in
this
im
mense
restless
brilliant
and
proud
sphere
prince
andrew
noticed
the
following
sharply
defined
subdivisions
of
tendencies
and
parties
the
first
party
consisted
of
pfuel
and
his
ad
herentsmilitary
theorists
who
believed
in
a
science
of
war
with
immutable
laws
laws
of
oblique
movements
outflankings
and
so
forth
.
pfuel
and
hisadherentsdemanded
a
retirement
into
the
depths
of
the
country
in
accordance
with
precise
laws
defined
by
a
pseudotheory
of
war
and
they
saw
only
barbarism
ignorance
or
evil
intention
in
every
deviation
from
that
theory
.
to
this
party
belonged
the
foreign
no
bles
wolzogen
wintzingerode
and
others
chiefly
germans
.
the
second
party
was
directly
opposed
to
the
first
one
extreme
as
always
happens
was
met
by
representatives
of
the
other
.
the
members
of
this
party
were
those
who
had
demanded
an
advance
from
vilna
into
poland
and
freedom
from
all
prearranged
plans
.
besides
being
ad
vocates
ot
bold
action
this
section
also
repre
sented
nationalism
which
made
them
still
more
onesided
in
the
dispute
.
they
were
russians
bagration
ermolov
who
was
beginning
to
come
to
the
front
and
others
.
at
that
time
a
famous
joke
of
erm61ovs
was
being
circulated
that
as
a
great
favor
he
had
petitioned
the
em
peror
to
make
him
a
german
.
the
men
of
that
party
remembering
suv6rov
said
that
what
one
had
to
do
was
not
to
reason
or
stick
pins
into
maps
but
to
fight
beat
the
enemy
keep
him
out
of
russia
and
not
let
the
army
get
dis
couraged
.
to
the
third
party
in
which
the
emperor
had
most
confidence
belonged
the
courtiers
who
tried
to
arrange
compromises
between
the
other
two
.
the
members
of
this
party
chiefly
civilians
and
to
whom
arakcheev
belonged
war
and
peace
thought
and
said
what
men
who
have
no
con
victions
but
wish
to
seem
to
have
some
gener
ally
say
.
they
said
that
undoubtedly
war
par
ticularly
against
such
a
genius
as
bonaparte
they
called
him
bonaparte
now
needs
most
deeply
devised
plans
and
profound
scientific
knowledge
and
in
that
respect
pfuel
was
a
genius
but
at
the
same
time
it
had
to
be
ac
knowledged
that
the
theorists
are
often
one
sided
and
therefore
one
should
not
trust
them
absolutely
but
should
also
listen
to
what
pfuels
opponents
and
practical
men
of
experience
in
warfare
had
to
say
and
then
choose
a
middle
course
.
they
insisted
on
the
retention
of
the
camp
at
drissa
according
to
pfuels
plan
but
on
changing
the
movements
of
the
other
ar
mies
.
though
by
this
course
neither
one
aim
nor
the
other
could
be
attained
yet
it
seemed
best
to
the
adherents
of
this
third
party
.
of
a
fourth
opinion
the
most
conspicuous
representative
was
the
tsarvich
who
could
not
forget
his
disillusionment
at
austerlitz
where
he
had
ridden
out
at
the
head
of
the
guards
in
his
casque
and
cavalry
uniform
as
to
a
review
expecting
to
crush
the
french
gal
lantly
but
unexpectedly
finding
himself
in
the
front
line
had
narrowly
escaped
amid
the
gen
eral
confusion
.
the
men
of
this
party
had
both
the
quality
and
the
defect
of
frankness
in
their
opinions
.
they
feared
napoleon
recognized
his
strength
and
their
own
weakness
and
frank
ly
said
so
.
they
said
nothing
but
sorrow
shame
and
ruin
will
come
of
all
this
we
have
abandoned
vilna
and
vitebsk
and
shall
aban
don
drissa
.
the
only
reasonable
thing
left
to
do
is
to
conclude
peace
as
soon
as
possible
be
fore
we
are
turned
out
of
petersburg
.
this
view
was
very
general
in
the
upper
ar
my
circles
and
found
support
also
in
peters
burg
and
from
the
chancellor
rumydntsev
who
for
other
reasons
of
state
was
in
favor
of
peace
.
the
fifth
party
consisted
of
those
who
were
adherents
of
barclay
de
tolly
not
so
much
as
a
man
but
as
minister
of
war
and
commander
in
chief
.
be
he
what
he
may
they
always
be
gan
like
that
he
is
an
honest
practical
man
and
we
have
nobody
better
.
give
him
real
power
for
war
cannot
be
conducted
success
fully
without
unity
of
command
and
he
will
show
what
he
can
do
as
he
did
in
finland
.
if
our
army
is
well
organized
and
strong
and
has
withdrawn
to
drissa
without
suffer
ing
any
defeats
we
owe
this
entirely
to
bar
clay
.
if
barclay
is
now
to
be
superseded
by
bennigsen
all
will
be
lost
for
bennigsen
showed
his
incapacity
already
in
1807
.
the
sixth
party
the
bennigsenites
said
on
the
contrary
that
at
any
rate
there
was
no
one
more
active
and
experienced
than
bennigsen
and
twist
about
as
you
may
you
will
have
to
come
to
bennigsen
eventually
.
let
the
others
make
mistakes
now


said
they
arguing
that
our
retirement
to
drissa
was
a
most
shameful
re
verse
and
an
unbroken
series
of
blunders
.
the
more
mistakes
that
are
made
the
better
.
it
will
at
any
rate
be
understood
all
the
sooner
that
things
cannot
go
on
like
this
.
what
is
wanted
is
not
some
barclay
or
other
but
a
man
like
bennigsen
who
made
his
mark
in
1807
and
to
whom
napoleon
himself
did
justice
a
man
whose
authority
would
be
willingly
recognized
and
bennigsen
is
the
only
such
man
.
the
seventh
party
consisted
of
the
sort
of
people
who
are
always
to
be
found
especially
around
young
sovereigns
and
of
whom
there
were
particularly
many
round
alexander
gen
erals
and
imperial
aidesdecamp
passionately
devoted
to
the
emperor
not
merely
as
a
mon
arch
but
as
a
man
adoring
him
sincerely
and
disinterestedly
as
rost6v
had
done
in
1805
and
who
saw
in
him
not
only
all
the
virtues
but
all
human
capabilities
as
well
.
these
men
though
enchanted
with
the
sovereign
for
refus
ing
the
command
of
the
army
yet
blamed
him
for
such
excessive
modesty
and
only
desired
and
insisted
that
their
adored
sovereign
should
abandon
his
diffidence
and
openly
announce
that
he
would
place
himself
at
the
head
of
the
army
gather
round
him
a
commander
in
chiefs
staff
and
consulting
experienced
theoreticians
and
practical
men
where
necessary
would
him
self
lead
the
troops
whose
spirits
would
there
by
be
raised
to
the
highest
pitch
.
the
eighth
and
largest
group
which
in
its
enormous
numbers
was
to
the
others
as
ninety
nine
to
one
consisted
of
men
who
desired
nei
ther
peace
nor
war
neither
an
advance
nor
a
defensive
camp
at
the
drissa
or
anywhere
else
neither
barclay
nor
the
emperor
neither
pfuel
nor
bennigsen
but
only
the
one
most
essential
thing
as
much
advantage
and
pleasure
for
themselves
as
possible
.
in
the
troubled
waters
of
conflicting
and
intersecting
intrigues
that
eddied
about
the
emperors
headquarters
it
was
possible
to
succeed
in
many
ways
unthink
able
at
other
times
.
a
man
who
simply
wished
to
retain
his
lucrative
post
would
today
agree
with
pfuel
tomorrow
with
his
opponent
and
the
day
after
merely
to
avoid
responsibility
or
to
please
the
emperor
would
declare
that
he
had
no
opinion
at
all
on
the
matter
.
another
book
who
wished
to
gain
some
advantage
would

tract
the
emperors
attention
by
loudly
acfvo
cating
the
very
thing
the
emperor
had
hinted
at
the
day
before
and
would
dispute
and
shout
at
the
council
beating
his
breast
and
challeng
ing
those
who
did
not
agree
with
him
to
duels
thereby
proving
that
he
was
prepared
to
sac
rifice
himself
for
the
common
good
.
a
third
in
the
absence
of
opponents
between
two
coun
cils
would
simply
solicit
a
special
gratuity
for
his
faithful
services
well
knowing
that
at
that
moment
people
would
be
too
busy
to
refuse
him
.
a
fourth
while
seemingly
overwhelmed
with
work
would
often
come
accidentally
un
der
the
emperors
eye
.
a
fifth
to
achieve
his
longcherished
aim
of
dining
with
the
emper
or
would
stubbornly
insist
on
the
correctness
or
falsity
of
some
newly
emerging
opinion
and
for
this
object
would
produce
arguments
more
or
less
forcible
and
correct
.
all
the
men
of
this
party
were
fishing
for
rubles
decorations
and
promotions
and
in
this
pursuit
watched
only
the
weathercock
of
imperial
favor
and
directly
they
noticed
it
turning
in
any
direction
this
whole
drone
pop
ulation
of
the
army
began
blowing
hard
that
way
so
that
it
was
all
the
harder
for
the
em
peror
to
turn
it
elsewhere
.
amid
the
uncer
tainties
of
the
position
with
the
menace
of
serious
danger
giving
a
peculiarly
threaten
ing
character
to
everything
amid
this
vortex
of
intrigue
egotism
conflict
of
views
and
feelings
and
the
diversity
of
race
among
these
people
tins
eighth
and
largest
party
of
those
preoccu
pied
with
personal
interests
imparted
great
confusion
and
obscurity
to
the
common
task
.
whatever
question
arose
a
swarm
of
these
drones
without
having
finished
their
buzzing
on
a
previous
theme
flew
over
to
the
new
one
and
by
their
hum
drowned
and
obscured
the
voices
of
those
who
were
disputing
honestly
.
from
among
all
these
parties
just
at
the
time
prince
andrew
reached
the
army
another
a
ninth
party
was
being
formed
and
was
be
ginning
to
raise
its
voice
.
this
was
the
party
of
the
elders
reasonable
men
experienced
and
capable
in
state
affairs
who
without
sharing
any
of
those
conflicting
opinions
were
able
to
take
a
detached
view
of
what
was
gong
on
at
the
staff
at
headquarters
and
to
consider
means
of
escape
from
this
muddle
indecision
intrica
cy
and
weakness
.
the
men
of
this
party
said
and
thought
that
what
was
wrong
resulted
chiefly
from
the
em
perors
presence
in
the
army
with
his
military
court
and
from
the
consequent
presence
there
nine
361
of
an
indefinite
conditional
and
unsteady
fluc
tuation
of
relations
which
is
in
place
at
court
but
harmful
in
an
army
that
a
sovereign
should
reign
but
not
command
the
army
and
that
the
only
way
out
of
the
position
would
be
for
the
emperor
and
his
court
to
leave
the
army
that
the
mere
presence
of
the
emperor
paralyzed
the
action
of
fifty
thousand
men
required
to
secure
his
personal
safety
and
that
the
worst
commander
in
chief
if
independent
would
be
better
than
the
very
best
one
trammeled
by
the
presence
and
authority
of
the
monarch
.
just
at
the
time
prince
andrew
was
living
unoccupied
at
drissa
shishk6v
the
secretary
of
state
and
one
of
the
chief
representatives
of
this
party
wrote
a
letter
to
the
emperor
which
arakcheev
and
balashev
agreed
to
sign
.
in
this
letter
availing
himself
of
permission
given
him
by
the
emperor
to
discuss
the
general
course
of
affairs
he
respectfully
suggested
on
the
plea
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
sovereign
to
arouse
a
warlike
spirit
in
the
people
of
the
capital
that
the
emperor
should
leave
the
army
.
that
arousing
of
the
people
by
their
sov
ereign
and
his
call
to
them
to
defend
their
country
the
very
incitement
which
was
the
chief
cause
of
russias
triumph
in
so
far
as
it
was
produced
by
the
tsars
personal
presence
in
moscow
was
suggested
to
the
emperor
and
accepted
by
him
as
a
pretext
for
quitting
the
army
.
chapter
x
this
letter
had
not
yet
been
presented
to
the
emperor
when
barclay
one
day
at
dinner
in
formed
bolk6nski
that
the
sovereign
wished
to
see
him
personally
to
question
him
about
turkey
and
that
prince
andrew
was
to

himself
at
bennigsens
quarters
at
six
that
evening
.
news
was
received
at
the
emperors
quarters
that
very
day
of
a
fresh
movement
by
napo
leon
which
might
endanger
the
army
news
subsequently
found
to
be
false
.
and
that
morn
ing
colonel
michaud
had
ridden
round
the
drissa
fortifications
with
the
emperor
and
had
pointed
out
to
him
that
this
fortified
camp
constructed
by
pfuel
and
till
then
considered
a
chefdoeuvre
of
tactical
science
which
would
ensure
napoleons
destruction
was
an
absurd
ity
threatening
the
destruction
of
the
russian
army
.
prince
andrew
arrived

banks

war
and
peace
neither
bennigsen
nor
the
emperor
was
there
but
chernyshev
the
emperors
aidedecamp
received
bolk6nski
and
informed
him
that
the
emperor
accompanied
by
general
bennigsen
and
marquis
paulucci
had
gone
a
second
time
that
day
to
inspect
the
fortifications
of
the
drissa
camp
of
the
suitability
of
which
serious
doubts
were
beginning
to
be
felt
.
chernyshev
was
sitting
at
a
window
in
the
first
room
with
a
french
novel
in
his
hand
.
this
room
had
probably
been
a
music
room
there
was
still
an
organ
in
it
on
which
some
rugs
were
piled
and
in
one
corner
stood
the
folding
bedstead
of
bennigsens
adjutant
.
this
adjutant
was
also
there
and
sat
dozing
on
the
rolledup
bedding
evidently
exhausted
by
work
or
by
feasting
.
two
doors
led
from
the
room
one
straight
on
into
what
had
been
the
draw
ing
room
and
another
on
the
right
to
the
study
.
through
the
first
door
came
the
sound
of
voices
con
versing
in
german
and
occasional
ly
in
french
.
in
that
drawing
room
were
gath
ered
by
the
emperors
wish
not
a
military
council
the
emperor
preferred
indefinite
ness
but
certain
persons
whose
opinions
he
wished
to
know
in
view
of
the
impending
dif
ficulties
.
it
was
not
a
council
of
war
but
as
it
were
a
council
to
elucidate
certain
questions
for
the
emperor
personally
.
to
this
semicoun
cil
had
been
invited
the
swedish
general
arm
feldt
adjutant
general
wolzogen
wintzinge
rode
whom
napoleon
had
referred
to
as
a
renegade
french
subject
michaud
toll
count
stein
who
was
not
a
military
man
at
all
and
pfuel
himself
who
as
prince
andrew
had
heard
was
the
mainspring
of
the
whole
affair
.
prince
andrew
had
an
opportunity
of
getting
a
good
look
at
him
for
pfuel
arrived
soon
after
himself
and
in
passing
through
to
the
draw
ing
room
stopped
a
minute
to
speak
to
cher
nyshev
.
at
first
sight
pfuel
in
his
illmade
uniform
of
a
russian
general
which
fitted
him
badly
like
a
fancy
costume
seemed
familiar
to
prince
andrew
though
he
saw
him
now
for
the
first
time
.
there
was
about
him
something
of
wey
rother
mack
and
schmidt
and
many
other
german
theoristgenerals
whom
prince
an
drew
had
seen
in
1805
but
he
was
more
typical
than
any
of
them
.
prince
andrew
had
never
yet
teen
a
german
theorist
in
whom
all
the
characteristics
of
those
others
were
united
to
such
an
extent
.
pfuel
was
short
and
very
thin
but
broad
boned
o
coarse
robust
build
broad
in
the
hips
and
with
prominent
shoulder
blades
.
his
face
was
much
wrinkled
and
his
eyes
deep
set
.
his
hair
had
evidently
been
hastily
brushed
smooth
in
front
of
the
temples
but
stuck
up
behind
in
quaint
little
tufts
.
he
entered
the
room
looking
restlessly
and
angrily

afraid

apart
ment

awkwardly
holding
up
his
sword
he
ad
dressed
chernyshev
and
asked
in
german
where
the
emperor
was
.
one
could
see
that
he
wished
to
pass
through
the
rooms
as
quickly
as
possible
finish
with
the
bows
and
greetings
and
sit
down
to
business
in
front
of
a
map
where
he
would
feel
at
home
.
he
nodded
hur
riedly
in
reply
to
chernyshev
and
smiled
iron
ically
on
hearing
that
the
sovereign
was
in
specting
the
fortifications
that
he
pfuel
had
planned
in
accord
with
his
theory
.
he
muttered
something
to
himself
abruptly
and
in
a
bass
voice
as
selfassured

doit
might
have
been
stupid

.
or
the
whole

will
be

prince
andrew
did
not
catch
what
he
said
and
would
have
passed
on
but
chernyshev
introduced
him
to
pfuel
re
marking
that
prince
andrew
was
just
back
from
turkey
where
the
war
had
terminated
so
fortunately
.
pfuel
barely
glanced
not
so
much
at
prince
andrew
as
past
him
and
said
with
a
laugh
that
must
have
been
a
fine
tactical
war
and
laughing
contemptuously
went
on
into
the
room
from
which
the
sound
of
voices
was
heard
.
pfuel
always
inclined
to
be
irritably
sarcas
tic
was
particularly
disturbed
that
day
evi
dently
by
the
fact
that
they
had
dared
to
in
spect
and
criticize
his
camp
in
his
absence
.
from
this
short
interview
with
pfuel
prince
andrew
thanks
to
his
austerlitz
experiences
was
able
to
form
a
clear
conception
of
the
man
.
pfuel
was
one
of
those
hopelessly
and
immu
tably
selfconfident
men
selfconfident
to
the
point
of
martyrdom
as
only
germans
are
be
cause
only
germans
are
selfconfident
on
the
basis
of
an
abstract
notion
science
that
is
the
supposed
knowledge
of
absolute
truth
.
a
frenchman
is
selfassured
because
he
regards
himself
personally
both
in
mind
and
body
as
irresistibly
attractive
to
men
and
women
.
an
englishman
is
selfassured
as
being
a
citizen
of
the
bestorganized
state
in
the
world
and
therefore
as
an
englishman
always
knows
what
he
should
do
and
knows
that
all
he
does
as
an
englishman
is
undoubtedly
correct
.
an
italian
is
selfassured
because
he
is
excitable
and
easily
forgets
himself
and
other
people
.
a
russian
is
selfassured
just
because
he
knows
nothing
and
book
does
not
want
to
know
anything
since
he
does
not
believe
that
anything
can
be
known
.
the
germans
selfassurance
is
worst
of
all
stronger
and
more
repulsive
than
any
other
because
he
imagines
that
he
knows
the
truthscience
which
he
himself
has
invented
but
which
is
for
him
the
absolute
truth
.
pfuel
was
evidently
of
that
sort
.
he
had
a
science
the
theory
of
oblique
movements
de
duced
by
him
from
the
history
of
frederick
the
greats
wars
and
all
he
came
across
in
the
history
of
more
recent
warfare
seemed
to
him
absurd
and
barbarous
monstrous
collisions
in
which
so
many
blunders
were
committed
by
both
sides
that
these
wars
could
not
be
called
wars
they
did
not
accord
with
the
theory
and
therefore
could
not
serve
as
material
for
science
.
in
1806
pfuel
had
been
one
of
those
respon
sible
for
the
plan
of
campaign
that
ended
in
jena
and
auerstadt
but
he
did
not
see
the
least
proof
of
the
fallibility
of
his
theory
in
the
disasters
of
that
war
.
on
the
contrary
the
de
viations
made
from
his
theory
were
in
his
opinion
the
sole
cause
of
the
whole
disaster
and
with
characteristically
gleeful
sarcasm
he
would
remark
there
i
said
the
whole
affair
would
go
to
the
devil
pfuel
was
one
of
those
theoreticians
who
so
love
their
theory
that
they
lose
sight
of
the
theorys
object
its
practical
application
.
his
love
of
theory
made
him
hate
everything
practical
and
he
would
not
listen
to
it
.
he
was
even
pleased
by
failures
for
fail
ures
resulting
from
deviations
in
practice
from
the
theory
only
proved
to
him
the
accuracy
of
his
theory
.
he
said
a
few
words
to
prince
andrew
and
chernyshev
about
the
present
war
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
knows
beforehand
that
all
will
go
wrong
and
who
is
not
displeased
that
it
should
be
so
.
the
unbrushed
tufts
of
hair
sticking
up
behind
and
the
hastily
brushed
hair
on
his
temples
expressed
this
most
elo
quently
.
he
passed
into
the
next
room
and
the
deep
querulous
sounds
of
his
voice
were
at
once
heard
from
there
.

the

and
excited

oblivious

the

into

he
was
followed
by

and

and

closed

prince
andrew
taking
advan
tage
of
the
emperors
permission
accompanied
paulucci
whom
he
had
known
in
turkey
in
to
the
drawing
room
where
the
council
was
as
sembled
.
prince
peter
mikhdylovich
volk6nski
occu
pied
the
position
as
it
were
of
chief
of
the
emperors
staff
.
he
came
out
of
the
study
into
the
drawing
room
with
some
maps
which
he
spread
on
a
table
and
put
questions
on
which
he
wished
to
hear
the
opinion
of
the
gentle
men
present
.
what
had
happened
was
that
news
which
afterwards
proved
to
be
false
had
been
received
during
the
night
of
a
move
ment
by
the
french
to
outflank
the
drissa
camp
.
the
first
to
speak
was
general
armfeldt
who
to
meet
the
difficulty
that
presented
it
self
unexpectedly
proposed
a
perfectly
new
position
away
from
the
petersburg
and
mos
cow
roads
.
the
reason
for
this
was
inexplicable
unless
he
wished
to
show
that
he
too
could
have
an
opinion
but
he
urged
that
at
this
point
the
army
should
unite
and
there
await
the
enemy
.
it
was
plain
that
armfeldt
had
thought
out
that
plan
long
ago
and
now
ex

.
pounded
it
not
so
much
to
answer
the
ques
tions
putwhich
in
fact
his
plan
did
not
an
364
war
and
peace
swer
as
to
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
to
air
it
.
it
was
one
of
the
millions
of
proposals
one
as
good
as
another
that
could
be
made
as
long
as
it
was
quite
unknown
what
character
the
war
would
take
.
some
disputed
his
argu
ments
others
defended
them
.
young
count
toll
objected
to
the
swedish
generals
views
more
warmly
than
anyone
else
and
in
the
course
of
the
dispute
drew
from
his
side
pocket
a
wellfilled
notebook
which
he
asked
permis
sion
to
read
to
them
.
in
these
voluminous
notes
toll
suggested
another
scheme
totally
differ
ent
from
armfeldts
or
pfuels
plan
of
cam
paign
.
in
answer
to
toll
paulucci
suggested
an
advance
and
an
attack
which
he
urged
could
alone
extricate
us
from
the
present
un
certainty
and
from
the
trap
as
he
called
the
drissa
camp
in
which
we
were
situated
.
during
all
these
discussions
pfuel
and
his
interpreter
wolzogen
his
bridge
in
court
relations
were
silent
.
pfuel
only
snorted
con
temptuously
and
turned
away
to
show
that
he
would
never
demean
himself
by
replying
to
such
nonsense
as
he
was
now
hearing
.
so
when
prince
volk6nski
who
was
in
the
chair
called
on
him
to
give
his
opinion
he
merely
said
why
ask
me
general
armfeldt
has
pro
posed
a
splendid
position
with
an
exposed
rear
or
why
not
this
italian
gentlemans
at
tackvery
fine
or
a

also
goodl
why
ask
me
said
he
.
why
you
yourselves
know
everything
better
than
i
do
.
but
when
volk6nski
said
with
a
frown
that
it
was
in
the
emperors
name
that
he
asked
his
opinion
pfuel
rose
and
suddenly
growing
ani
mated
began
to
speak
everything
has
been
spoiled
everything
muddled
everybody
thought
they
knew
better
than
i
did
and
now
you
come
to
me
how
mend
matters
there
is
nothing
to
mend
the
principles
laid
down
by
me
must
be
strictly
ad
hered
to
said
he
drumming
on
the
tablewith
his
bony
fingers
.
what
is
the
difficulty
non
sense
childishness
he
went
up
to
the
map
and
speaking
rapid
ly
began
proving
that
no
eventuality
could
al
ter
the
efficiency
of
the
drissa
camp
that
every
thing
had
been
foreseen
and
that
if
the
enemy
were
really
going
to
outflank
it
the
enemy
would
inevitably
be
destroyed
.
paulucci
who
did
not
know
german
began
questioning
him
in
french
.
wolzogen
came
to
the
assistance
of
his
chief
who
spoke
french
badly
and
began
translating
for
him
hardly
able
to
keep
pace
with
pfuel
who
was
rapidly
demonstrating
that
not
only
all
that
had
hap
pened
but
all
that
could
happen
had
been
foreseen
in
his
scheme
and
that
if
there
were
now
any
difficulties
the
whole
fault
lay
in
the
fact
that
his
plan
had
not
been
precisely
exe
cuted
.
he
kept
laughing
sarcastically
he
dem
onstrated
and
at
last
contemptuously
ceased
to
demonstrate
like
a
mathematician
who
ceases
to
prove
in
various
ways
the
accuracy
of
a
problem
that
has
already
been
proved
.
wol
zogen
took
his
place
and
continued
to

turn

all
except
pfuel
had
one
common
trait
that
had
not
been
noticeable
at
the
council
of
war
in
1805
there
was
now
a
panic
fear
of
napoleons
genius
which
though
concealed
was
noticeable
in
every
rejoinder

everything
was
assumed
to

they
expected
him
from

and
invoked

shatter

pfuel
alone
seemed
to
con

barbarian
like
everyone
else

opposed

from
the
tone

which
the
courtiers
addressed
him
and
the
way
paulucci
had
al
lowed
himself
to
speak
of
him
to
the
emperor
but
above
all
from
a
certain
desperation
in
pfuels
own
expressions
it
was
clear
that
the
others
knew
and
pfuel
himself
felt
that
his
fall
was
at
hand
.
and
despite
his
selfconfi
dence
and
grumpy
german
sarcasm
he
was
pitiable
with
his
hair
smoothly
brushed
on
the
temples
and
sticking
up
in

behind

concealed

that
the
sole
remaining
chance
of
veri
fying
his
theory
by
a
huge
experiment
and
proving
its
soundness
to
the
whole
world
was
slipping
away
from
him
.
the
discussions
continued
a
long
time
and
the
longer
they
lasted
the
more
heated
became
the
disputes
culminating
in
shouts
and
per
sonalities
and
the
less
was
it
possible
to
arrive
at
any
general
conclusion
from
all
that
had
been

prince
andrew
listening
to
this
polyglot
talk
and
to
these
surmises
plans
ref
utations
and
shouts
felt
nothing
but
amaze
ment
at
what
they
were
saying
.
a
thought
that
had
long
since
and
often
occurred
to
him
dur
ing
his
military
activitiesthe
idea
that
there
is
not
and
cannot
be
any
science
of
war
and
that
therefore
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
a
military
genius

to
him

ob
vious
truth
.

and
science
is
possi

about
a
matter
the
conditions
and
circum
stances
of
which
are
unknown
and
cannot
be
defined

when
the

of

acting

cannot
be
ascertained

one
was
or
is
able
to
foresee
in
what
condition
our
or
the
enemys
armies
will
be
in
a
days
time
and
no
one
can
gauge
the
force
of
this
or
that
detachment
.
sometimes
when
there
is
not
a
coward
at
the
front
to
shout
we
are
cut
off
and
start
running
but
a
brave
and
jolly
lad
who
shouts
hurrah
a

worth
thirty
thousand
as
at

while
at
times
fifty
thousand
run
from

what
science
can
there
be
in
a
matter
in
which
as
in
all
practical
matters
nothing
can
be
defined
and
everything
depends
on
innumerable
con
ditions
the
significance
of
which
is
determined
at
a
particular
moment
which
arrives
no
one
knows
when
armfeldt
says
our
army
is
cut
in
half
and
paulucci
says
we
have
got

michaud
says
that
the
worthlessness
of
the
drissa

behind
it

so
thought
prince
andrew
as
he
listened
to
the
talking
and
he
roused
himself
only
when
paulucci
called
him
and
everyone
was
leaving
.
at
the
review
next
day
the
emperor
asked
prince
andrew
where
he
would
like
to

prince

lost

chapter
xii
before
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
ros
t6v
had
received
a
letter
from
his
parents
in
which
they
told
him
briefly
of
natdshas
illness
and
the
breaking
off
of
her
engagement
to
prince
andrew
which
they
explained
by
na
tdshas
having
rejected
him
and
again
asked
nicholas
to
retire
from
the
army
and
return
home
.
on
receiving
this
letter
nicholas
did
not
even
make
any
attempt
to
get
leave
of
ab
sence
or
to
retire
from
the
army
but
wrote
to
his
parents
that
he
was
sorry
natasha
was
ill
and
her
engagement
broken
off
and
that
he
would
do
all
he
could
to
meet
their
wishes
.
to
s6nya
he
wrote
separately
.

but
now
at
the

i
should
feel
dishon
ored
not
only
in
my
comrades
eyes
but
in
my
own
if
i
preferred
my
own
happiness
to
my
love
and

to

but
this
shall
be
our

it
was
in
fact
only
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
that
prevented
rost6v
from
re
turning
home
as
he
had
promised
and
marry
ing
s6nya
.
the
autumn
in
otradnoe
with
the
hunting
and
the
winter
with
the
christmas
holidays
and
sonyas
love
had
opened
out
to
him
a
vista
of
tranquil
rural
joys
and
peace
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
and
which
now
allured
him
.

.
thought
he
.
but
now
the
campaign
was
beginning
and
he
had
to
remain
with
his
regiment
.
and
since
it
had
to
be
so
nicholas
rost6v
as
was
natural
to
him
felt
contented
with
the
life
he
led
in
the
regiment
and
was
able
to
find
pleasure
in
that
life
.
on
his
return
from
his
furlough
nicholas
having
been
joyfully
welcomed
by
his
com
rades
was
sent
to
obtain
remounts
and
brought
back
from
the
ukraine
excellent
horses
which
pleased
him
and
earned
him
commendation
from
his
commanders
.
during
his
absence
he
had
been
promoted
captain
and
when
the
regiment
was
put
on
war
footing
with
an
in
crease
in
numbers
he
was
again
allotted
his
old
squadrbn
.
the
campaign
began
the
regiment
was
moved
into
poland
on
double
pay
new
of
ficers
arrived
new
men
and
horses
and
above
all
everybody
was
infected
with
the
merrily
ex
cited
mood
that
goes
with
the
commencement
of
a
war
and
rostov
conscious
of
his
advan
tageous
position
in
the
regiment
devoted
him
self
entirely
to
the
pleasures
and
interests
of
military
service
though
he
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
have
to
relinquish
them
.
the
troops
retired
from
vilna
for
various
complicated
reasons
of
state
political
and
strategic
.
each
step
of
the
retreat
was
accom
panied
by
a
complicated
interplay
of
interests
arguments
and
passions
at
headquarters
.
for
the
pavlograd
hussars
however
the
whole
of
this
retreat
during
the
finest
period
of
summer
and
with
sufficient
supplies
was
a
very
simple
and
agreeable
business
.
it
was
only
at
headquarters
that
there
was
depression
uneasiness
and
intriguing
in
the
body
of
the
army
they
did
not
ask
themselves
where
they
were
going
or
why
.
if
they
regretted
having
to
retreat
it
was
only
because
they
had
to
leave
billets
they
had
grown
accustomed
to
or
some
pretty
young
polish
lady
.
if
the
thought
that
things
looked
bad
chanced
to
en
ter
anyones
head
he
tried
to
be
as
cheerful
as
war
and
peace
befits
a
good
soldier
and
not
to
think
of
the
general
trend
of
affairs
but
only
of
the
task
nearest
to
hand
.
first
they
camped
gaily
be
fore
vilna
making
acquaintance
with
the
polish
landowners
preparing
for
reviews
and
being
reviewed
by
the
emperor
and
other
high
commanders
.
then
came
an
order
to
retreat
to
sventsyani
and
destroy
any
provisions
they
could
not
carry
away
with
them
.
sventsyani
was
remembered
by
the
hussars
only
as
the
drunken
camp
a
name
the
whole
army
gave
to
their
encampment
there
and
because
many
complaints
were
made
against
the
troops
who
taking
advantage
of
the
order
to
collect
provi
sions
took
also
horses
carriages
and
carpets
from
the
polish
proprietors
.
rostov
remem
bered
sventsydni
because
on
the
first
day
of
their
arrival
at
that
small
town
he
changed
his
sergeant
major
and
was
unable
to
manage
all
the
drunken
men
of
his
squadron
who
un
known
to
him
had
appropriated
five
barrels
of
old
beer
.
from
sventsyani
they
retired
far
ther
and
farther
to
drissa
and
thence
again
beyond
drissa
drawing
near
to
the
frontier
of
russia
proper
.
on
the
thirteenth
of
july
the
pdvlograds
took
part
in
a
serious
action
for
the
first
time
.
on
the
twelfth
of
july
on
the
eve
of
that
action
there
was
a
heavy
storm
of
rain
and
hail
.
in
general
the
summer
of
1812
was
re
markable
for
its
storms
.
the
two
pdvlograd
squadrons
were
bivouack
ing
on
a
field
of
rye
which
was
already
in
ear
but
had
been
completely
trodden
down
by
cattle
and
horses
.
the
rain
was
descending
in
torrents
and
rostov
with
a
young
officer
named
ilyfn
his
protg
was
sitting
in
a
hasti
ly
constructed
shelter
.
an
officer
of
their
regi
ment
with
long
mustaches
extending
onto
his
cheeks
who
after
riding
to
the
staff
had
been
overtaken
by
the
rain
entered
rost6vssheltcr
.
i
have
come
from
the
staff
count
.
have
you
heard
of
ravskis
exploit
and
the
officer
gave
them
details
of
the
sal
tanov
battle
which
he
had
heard
at
the
staff
.
rostov
smoking
his
pipe
and
turning
his
head
about
as
the
water
trickled
down
his
neck
listened
inattentively
with
an
occasional
glance
at
ilyfn
who
was
pressing
close
to
him
.
this
officer
a
lad
of
sixteen
who
had
recently
joined
the
regiment
was
now
in
the
same
rela
tion
to
nicholas
that
nicholas
had
been
to
denfsov
seven
years
before
.
ilyin
tried
to
imi
tate
rost6v
in
everything
and
adored
him
as
a
girl
might
have
done
.
zdrzhinski
the
officer
with
the
long
mus
book
nine
tache
spoke
grandiloquently
of
the
saltanov
dam
being
a
russian
thermopylae
and
of
how
a
deed
worthy
of
antiquity
had
been
per
formed
by
general
ravski
.
he
recounted
how
rae
vski
had
led
his
two
sons
onto
the
dam
un
der
terrific
fire
and
had
charged
with
them
be
side
him
.
rost6v
heard
the
story
and
not
only
said
nothing
to
encourage
zdrzhinskis
enthu
siasm
but
on
the
contrary
looked
like
a
man
ashamed
of
what
he
was
hearing
though
with
no
intention
of
contradicting
it
.
since
the
cam
paigns
of
austerlitz
and
of
1807
rost6v
knew
by
experience
that
men
always
lie
when
de
scribing
military
exploits
as
he
himself
had
done
when
recounting
them
besides
that
he
had
experience
enough
to
know
that
nothing
happens
in
war
at
all
as
we
can
imagine
or
re
late
it
.
and
so
he
did
not
like
zdrzhinskis
tale
nor
did
he
like
zdrzhinski
himself
who
with
his
mustaches
extending
over
his
cheeks
bent
low
over
the
face
of
his
hearer
as
was
his
habit
and
crowded
rost6v
in
the
narrow
shanty
.
rost6v
looked
at
him
in
silence
.
in
the
first
place
there
must
have
been
such
a
confusion
and
crowding
on
the
dam
that
was
being
at
tacked
that
if
raevski
did
lead
his
sons
there
it
could
have
had
no
effect
except
perhaps
on
some
dozen
men
nearest
to
him
thought
he
the
rest
could
not
have
seen
how
or
with
whom
radvski
came
onto
the
dam
.
and
even
those
who
did
see
it
would
not
have
been
much
stimulated
by
it
for
what
had
they
to
do
with
ravskis
tender
paternal
feelings
when
their
own
skins
were
in
danger
and
besides
the
fate
of
the
fatherland
did
not
depend
on
whether
they
took
the
saltdnov
dam
or
not
as
we
are
told
was
the
case
at
thermopylae
.
so
why
should
he
have
made
such
a
sacrifice
and
why
expose
his
own
children
in
the
battle
i
would
not
have
taken
my
brother
petya
there
or
even
ilyin
whos
a
stranger
to
me
but
a
nice
lad
but
would
have
tried
to
put
them
some
where
under
cover
nicholas
continued
to
think
as
he
listened
to
zdrzhinski
.
but
he
did
not
express
his
thoughts
for
in
such
matters
too
he
had
gained
experience
.
he
knew
that
this
tale
redounded
to
the
glory
of
our
arms
and
so
one
had
to
pretend
not
to
doubt
it
.
and
he
acted
accordingly
.
i
cant
stand
this
any
more
said
ilyfn
no
ticing
that
rost6v
did
not
relish
zdrzhinskis
conversation
.

and

and
the
water
is
running
on
my
seatl
ill
go
and
look
for
shelter
.
the
rain
seems
less
heavy
.
ilyfn
went
out
and
zdrzhinski
rode
away
.
five
minutes
later
ilyfn
splashing
through
567
the
mud
came
running
back
to
the
shanty
.
hurrah
rostov
come
quick
ive
found
it
about
two
hundred
yards
away
theres
a
tavern
where
ours
have
already
gathered
.
we
can
at
least
get
dry
there
and
mary
hendrfkhovnas
there
.
mary
hendrfkhovna
was
the
wife
of
the
regi
mental
doctor
a
pretty
young
german
woman
he
had
married
in
poland
.
the
doctor
wheth
er
from
lack
of
means
or
because
he
did
not
like
to
part
from
his
young
wife
in
the
early
days
of
their
marriage
took
her
about
with
him
wherever
the
hussar
regiment
went
and
his
jealousy
had
become
a
standing
joke
among
the
hussar
officers
.
rost6v
threw
his
cloak
over
his
shoulders
shouted
to
lavriishka
to
follow
with
the
things
and
now
slipping
in
the
mud
now
splashing
right
through
it
set
off
with
ilyfn
in
the
les
sening
rain
and
the
darkness
that
was
occa
sionally
rent
by

are

chapter

in
the

before

stood
the

there
were
already
some
five
of
ficers
.
mary
hendrfkhovna
a
plump
little
blonde
german
in
a
dressing
jacket
and
night
cap
was
sitting
on
a
broad
bench
in
the
front
corner
.
her
husband
the
doctor
lay
asleep
be
hind
her
.
rost6v
and
ilyfn
on
entering
the
room
were
welcomed
with
merry
shouts
and
laughter
.
dear
me
how
jolly
we
are
said
rost6v
laughing
.
and
why
do
you
stand
there
gaping
what
swells
they
are
why
the
water
streams
from
them
dont
make
our
drawing
room

dont

cried
other
voices

rostov
and
ilyfn
hastened
to
find
a
corner
where
they
could
change
into
dry
clothes
without
offending
mary
hendrfkhovnas
modesty
.
they
were
going
into
a
tiny
recess
behind
a
partition
to
change
but
found
it
completely
filled
by
three
officers
who
sat
playing
cards
by
the
light
of
a
solitary
candle
on
an
empty
box
and
these
officers
would
on
no
account
yield
their
position
.
mary
hendrfkhovna
obliged
them
with
the
loan
of
a
petticoat
to
be
used
as
a
curtain
and
be
hind

war
and

changed
their
wet
things
for
dry
ones
.
a
fire
was
made
up
in
the
dilapidated
brick
stove
.
a
board
was
found
fixed
on
two
saddles
and
covered
with
a
horsecloth
a
small
samovar
was
produced
and
a
cellaret
and
half
a
bottle
of
rum
and
having
asked
mary
hendrfkhovna
to
preside
they
all
crowded
round
her
.
one
of
fered
her
a
clean
handkerchief
to
wipe
her
charming
hands
another
spread
a
jacket
un
der
her
little
feet
to
keep
them
from
the
damp
another
hung
his
coat
over
the
window
to
keep
out
the
draft
and
yet
another
waved
the
flics
off
her
husbands
face
lest
he
should
wake
up
.
leave
him
alone
said
mary
hendrikhov
na
smiling
timidly
and
happily
.
he
is
sleep
ing
well
as
it
is
after
a
sleepless
night
.
oh
no
mary
hendrikhovna
replied
the
officer
one
must
look
after
the
doctor
.
per
haps
hell
take
pity
on
me
someday
when
it
comes
to
cutting
off
a
leg
or
an
arm
for
me
.
there
were
only
three
tumblers
the
water
was
so
muddy
that
one
could
not
make
out
whether
the
tea
was
strong
or
weak
and
the
samovar
held
only
six
tumblers
of
water
but
this
made
it
all
the
pleasanter
to
take
turns
in
order
of
seniority
to
receive
ones
tumbler
from
mary
hendrikhovnas
plump
little
hands
with
their
short
and
not
overclean
nails
.
all
the
of
ficers
appeared
to
be
and
really
were
in
love
with
her
that
evening
.
even
those
playing
cards
behind
the
partition
soon
left
their
game
and
came
over
to
the
samovar
yielding
to
the
general
mood
of
courting
mary
hendrikhov
na
.
she
seeing
herself
surrounded
by
such
brilliant
and
polite
young
men
beamed
with
satisfaction
try
as
she
might
to
hide
it
and
perturbed
as
she
evidently
was
each
time
her
husband
moved
in
his
sleep
behind
her
.
there
was
only
one
spoon
sugar
was
more
plentiful
than
anything
else
but
it
took
too
long
to
dissolve
so
it
was
decided
that
mary
hendrikhovna
should
stir
the
sugar
for
every
one
in
turn
.
rost6v
received
his
tumbler
and
adding
some
rum
to
it
asked
mary
hendrik
hovna
to
stir
it
.
but
you
take
it
without
sugar
she
said
smiling
all
the
time
as
if
everything
she
said
and
everything
the
others
said
was
very
amus
ing
and
had
a
double
meaning
.
it
is
not
the
sugar
i
want
but
only
that
your
little
hand
should
stir
my
tea
.
mary
hendrikhovna
assented
and
began
looking
for
the
spoon
which
someone

while
had
pounced
on

will
be

said

she
replied
blushing
with

ilyin
put
a
few
drops
of
rum
into
the
bucket
of
water
and
brought
it
to
mary

na
asking
her
to
stir
it
with
her

.
this
is
my

said
he
.
only
dip
your

in
it
and
ill

it
all
up

when
they
had
emptied
the
samovar
ros
t6v
took
a
pack
of
cards
and
proposed
that
they
should
play
kings
with
mary
hendrik
hovna
.
they
drew
lots
to
settle
who
should
make
up
her
set
.
at
rost6vs
suggestion
it
was
agreed
that
whoever
became
king
should
have
the
right
to
kiss
mary
hendrikhovnas
hand
and
that
the
booby
should
go
to
refill
and
reheat
the
samovar
for
the
doctor
when
the
latter
awoke
.
well
but
supposing
mary
hendrfkhovna
is
king
asked
ilyin
.
as
it
is
she
is
queen
and
her
word
is
law
they
had
hardly
begun
to
play
before
the
doctors
disheveled
head
suddenly
appeared
from
behind
mary
hendrikhovna
.
he
had
been
awake
for
some
time
listening
to
what
was
being
said
and
evidently
found
nothing
entertaining
or
amusing
in
what
was
going
on
.
his
face
was
sad
and
depressed
.
without
greet
ing
the
officers
he
scratched
himself
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
pass
as
they
were
blocking
the
way
.
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
room
all
the
of
ficers
burst
into
loud
laughter
and
mary
hen
drikhovna
blushed
till
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
thereby
became
still
more
attractive
to
them
.
returning
from
the
yard
the
doctor
told
his
wife
who
had
ceased
to
smile
so
hap
pily
and
looked
at
him
in
alarm
awaiting
her
sentence
that
the
rain
had
ceased
and
they
must
go
to
sleep
in
their
covered
cart
or
every
thing
in
it
would
be
stolen
.
but
ill
send
an
orderly
two
of
them
said
rost6v
.
what
an
idea
doctorl
ill
stand
guard
on
it
myself
said
ilyin
.
no
gentlemen
you
have
had
your
sleep
but
i
have
not
slept
for
two
nights
replied
the
doctor
and
he
sat
down
morosely
beside
his
wife
waiting
for
the
game
to
end
.
seeing
his
gloomy
face
as
he
frowned
at
his
wife
the
officers
grew
still
merrier
and
some
of
them
could
not
refrain
from
laughter
for
which
they
hurriedly
sought
plausible
pre
texts
.
when
he
had
gone
taking
his
wife
with
him
and
had
settled
down
with
her
in
their
covered
cart
the
officers
lay
down
in
the
tavern
covering
themselves
with
their
wet
cloaks
but
they
did
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
now
they
exchanged
remarks
recalling
the
doctors
un
book
easiness
and
his
wifes
delight
now
they
ran
out
into
the
porch
and
reported
what
was
tak
ing
place
in
the
covered
trap
.
several
times
rost6v
covering
his
head
tried
to
go
to
sleep
but
some
remark
would
arouse
him
and
con
versation
would
be
resumed
to
the
accom
paniment
of
unreasoning
merry
childlike
laughter
.

it
was
nearly
three
oclock
but
no
one
was
yet
asleep
when
the
quartermaster
appeared
with
an
order
to
move
on
to
the
little
town
of
os

.
still
laughing
and
talking
the
officers
began
hurriedly
getting
ready
and
again
boiled
some
muddy
water
in
the
samovar
.
but
ros
t6v
went
off
to
his
squadron
without
waiting
for
tea
.
day
was
breaking
the
rain
had
ceased
arid
the
clouds
were
dispersing
.
it
felt
damp
and
cold
especially
in
clothes
that
were
still
moist
.

they
left

in
the
twilight
of

and

glanced
un

the
wet
and
glistening

of
the

cart
from
under
the
apron
of
which
his
feet
were
sticking
out
and
in
the
middle
of
which
his
wifes
nightcap
was
visible
and
her
sleepy
breathing
audible
.
she
really
is
a
dear

said
ros
t6v
to
ilyin
who
was
following
him
.
a
charming
woman
said
ilyin
with
all
the
gravity
of
a
boy
of
sixteen
.
half
an
hour
later
the
squadron
was
lined
up
on
the
road
.
the
command
was
heard
to
mount
and
the
soldiers
crossed
themselves
and
mounted
.

in

defiled
in

and
moved
along

broad
road
planted
with
birch
trees
on
each
side
following
the
infantry
and
a
battery
that
had
gone
on

.
tattered

clouds
reddening
in
the

were
scudding
before

and

the

the

were
more
and
more
clearly
visible
.
ros
t6v
always
closely
followed
by
ilyin
rode
along
the
side
of
the
road
between
two
rows
of
birch
trees
.
when
campaigning
rost6v
allowed
himself
the
indulgence
of
riding
not
a
regimental
but
nine
3

a
cossack
horse
.
a
judge
of
horses
and
a
sports
man
he
had
lately
procured
himself
a
large
fine
mettlesome
donets
horse
duncolored
with
light
mane
and
tail
and
when
he
rode
it
no
one
could
outgallop
him
.
to
ride
this
horse
was
a
pleasure
to
him
and
he
thought
of
the
horse
of
the
morning
of
the
doctors
wife
but
not
once
of
the
impending
danger
.
formerly
when
going
into
action
rost6v
had
felt
afraid
now
he
had
not
the
least
feel
ing
of
fear
.
he
was
fearless
not
because
he
had
grown
used
to
being
under
fire
one
cannot
grow
used
to
danger
but
because
he
had
learned
how
to
manage
his
thoughts
when
in
danger
.
he
had
grown
accustomed
when
go
ing
into
action
to
think
about
anything
but
what
would
seem
most
likely
to
interest
him
the
impending
danger
.
during
the
first
period
of
his
service
hard
as
he
tried
and
much
as
he
reproached
himself
with
cowardice
he
had
not
been
able
to
do
this
but
with
time
it
had
come
of
itself
.
now
he
rode
beside
ilyin
under
the
birch
trees
occasionally
plucking
leaves
from
a
branch
that
met
his
hand
sometimes
touch
ing
his
horses
side
with
his
foot
or
without
turning
round
handing
a
pipe
he
had
finished
to
an
hussar
riding
behind
him
with
as
calm
and
careless
an
air
as
though
he
were
merely
out
for
a
ride
.
he
glanced
with
pity
at
the
ex
cited
face
of
ilyin
who
talked
much
and
in
great
agitation
.
he
knew
from
experience
the
tormenting
expectation
of
terror
and
death
the
cornet
was
suffering
and
knew
that
only
time
could
help
him
.
as
soon
as
the
sun
appeared
in
a
clear
strip
of
sky
beneath
the
clouds
the
wind
fell
as
if
it
dared
not
spoil
the
beauty
of
the
summer
morning
after
the
storm
drops
still
continued
to
fall
but
vertically
now
and
all
was
still
.
the
whole
sun
appeared
on
the
horizon
and
disappeared
behind
a
long
narrow
cloud
that
hung
above
it
.
a
few
minutes
later
it
reap
peared
brighter
still
from
behind
the
top
of
the
cloud
tearing
its
edge
.
everything
grew
bright
and
glittered
.
and
with
that
light
and
as
if
in
reply
to
it
came
the
sound
of
guns
ahead
of
them
.
before
rostov
had
had
time
to
consider
and
determine
the
distance
of
that
firing
count
ostermanntolstoys

came
galloping
from

behind

who
were

to

stood
our

in

dense
column
they
were

higher
up

on

our

were

could
be

briskly
ex

at
these

rose
as
at

again
all
was

and
then
again
it
sounded
as
if

were

on

and
exploding

.
the
hussars
remained
in
the

place
for
about

to

the

started
the
streamers
on
their
spears
flut
tering
and
trotted
downhill
toward
the
french
cavalry
which
was
seen
below
to
the
left
.
as
soon
as
the
uhlans
descended
the
hill
the
hussars
were
ordered
up
the
hill
to
support
the
battery
.
as
they
took
the
places
vacated
by
the
uhlans
bullets
came
from

whin

fell

without

the
sounds
which

had
not

for
so
long
had
an
even
more
pleasurable
and
ex
hilarating
effect
on
rost6v
than
the
previous
sounds
of
firing
.
drawing
himself
up
he
viewed
the
field
of
battle
opening
out
before
him
from
the
hill
and
with
his
whole
soul
followed
the
movement
of
the

swooped
down

to

there
amid

and
five
minutes
later
our

were
galloping
back
not
to

they
had
occupied
but
more
to
the
left
and
among
the
orangecolored
uhlans
on
chestnut
horses
and
behind
them
in
a
large
group
blue
french
dragoons
on
gray
horses
could
be
seen
.
chapter
xv
rostov
with
his
keen
sportsmans
eye
was
one
of
the
first
to
catch
sight
of
these
blue
french
dragoons
pursuing
our
uhlans
.
nearer
and
nearer
in
disorderly
crowds
came
the
uh
lans
and
the
french
dragoons
pursuing
them
.
he
could
already
see
how
these
men
who
looked
so
small
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
jostled
and
overtook
one
another
waving
their
arms
and
their
sabers
in
the
air
.
rost6v
gazed
at
what
was
happening
before
him
as
at
a
hunt
.
he
felt
instinctively
that
if
the
hussars
struck
at
the
french
dragoons
now
the
latter
could
not
withstand
them
but
if
a
charge
was
to
be
made
it
must
be
done
now
at
that
very
moment
or
it
would
be
too
late
.
he
looked
around
.
a
captain
standing
beside
him
was
gazing
like
himself
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
cavalry
below
them
.
andrew
sevastyinychl
said
rost6v
.
you
know
we
could
crush
them

a
fine
thing
tool
replied
the
captain
and
really

.

.

.
rost6v
without
waiting
to
hear
him
out
touched
his
horse
galloped
to
the
front
of
his
squadron
and
before
he
had
time
to
finish
giving
the
word
of
command
the
whole
squad
ron
sharing
his
feeling
was
following
him
.
rost6v
himself
did
not
know
how
or
why
he
did
it
.
he
acted
as
he
did
when
hunting
with
out
reflecting
or
considering
.
he
saw
the
dra
goons
near
and
that
they
were
galloping
in
dis
order
he
knew
they
could
not
withstand
an
attack
knew
there
was
only
that
moment
and
that
if
he
let
it
slip
it
would
not
return
.
the
bullets
were
whining
and
whistling
so
stimu
latingly
around
him
and
his
horse
was
so
eager
to
go
that
he
could
not
restrain
himself
.
he
touched
his
horse
gave
the
word
of
command
and
immediately
hearing
behind
him
the
tramp
of
the
horses
of
his
deployed
squadron
rode
at
full
trot
downhill
toward
the
dragoons
.
hardly
had
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
before
their
pace
instinctively
changed
to
a
gallop
which
grew
faster
and
faster
as
they
drew
nearer
to
our
uhlans
and
the
french
dragoons
who
galloped
after
them
.
the
dra
goons
were
now
close
at
hand
.
on
seeing
the
hussars
the
foremost
began
to
turn
while
those
behind
began
to
halt
.
with
the
same
feeling
with
which
he
had
galloped
across
the
path
of
a
wolf
rost6v
gave
rein
to
his
done
ts
book
nine
horse
and
galloped
to
intersect
the
path
of
the
dragoons
disordered
lines
.
one
uhlan
stopped
another
who
was
on
foot
flung
himself
to
the
ground
to
avoid
being
knocked
over
and
a
riderless
horse
fell
in
among
the
hussars
.
near
ly
all
the
french
dragoons
were
galloping
back
.
rost6v
picking
out
one
on
a
gray
horse
dashed
after
him
.
on
the
way
he
came
upon
a
bush
his
gallant
horse
cleared
it
and
almost
before
he
had
righted
himself
in
his
saddle
he
saw
that
he
would
immediately
overtake
the
en
emy
he
had
selected
.
that
frenchman
by
his
uniform
an
officer
was
going
at
a
gallop
crouching
on
his
gray
horse
and
urging
it
on
with
his
saber
.
in
another
moment
rost6vs
horse
dashed
its
breast
against
the
hindquarters
of
the
officers
horse
almost
knocking
it
over
and
at
the
same
instant
rost6v
without
know
ing
why
raised
his
saber
and
struck
the
french
man
with
it
.
the
instant
he
had
done
this
all
rost6vs
animation
vanished
.
the
officer
fell
not
so
much
from
the
blowwhich
had
but
slightly
cut
his
arm
above
the
elbow
as
from
the
shock
to
his
horse
and
from
fright
.
rost6v
reined
in
his
horse
and
his
eyes
sought
his
foe
to
see
whom
he
had
vanquished
.
the
french
dragoon
officer
was
hopping
with
one
foot
on
the
ground
the
other
being
caught
in
the
stir
rup
.
his
eyes
screwed
up
with
fear
as
if
he
every
moment
expected
another
blow
gazed
up
at
rost6v
with
shrinking
terror
.
his
pale
and
mudstained
face
fair
and
young
with
a
dimple
in
the
chin
and
lightblue
eyes
was
not
an
enemys
face
at
all
suited
to
a
battlefield
but
a
most
ordinary
homelike
face
.
before
rost6v
had
decided
what
to
do
with
him
the
officer
cried
i
surrenderl
he
hurriedly
but
vainly
tried
to
get
his
foot
out
of
the
stirrup
and
did
not
remove
his
frightened
blue
eyes
from
rost6vs
face
.
some
hussars
who
galloped
up
disengaged
his
foot
and
helped
him
into
the
saddle
.
on
all
sides
the
hussars
were
busy
with
the
dragoons
one
was
wounded
but
though
his
face
was
bleeding
he
would

him
all

he
still
felt

disagreeable
feeling

.

what

and
i

rost6v
saw
the
prisoners
being
led
away
and
galloped
after
them
to
have
a
look
at
his
frenchman
with
the
dimple
on
his
chin
.
he
was
sitting
in
his
foreign
uniform
on
an
hussar
packhorse
and
looked
anxiously
about
him
.
the
sword
cut
on
his
arm
could
scarcely
be
called
a
wound
.
he
glanced
at
rost6v
with
a
feigned
smile
and
waved
his
hand
in
greeting
.
rost6v
still
had
the
same
indefinite
feeling
as
of
shame
.
all
that
day
and
the
next
his
friends
and
comrades
noticed
that
rost6v
without
being
dull
or
angry
was
silent
thoughtful
and
pre
occupied
.
he
drank
reluctantly
tried
to
re
main
alone
and
kept
turning
something
over
in
his
mind
.
rostov
was
always
thinking
about
that
bril
liant
exploit
of
his
which
to
his
amazement
had
gained
him
the
st

cross
and
even
given
him
a
reputation
for
bravery
and
there
was
something
he
could
not
at
all
understand
.
so
others
are
even
more
afraid
than
i
ami
he
thought
.
so
thats
all
there
is
in
what
is
called
heroism
i
and
did
i
do
it
for
my
countrys
sake
and
how
was
he
to
blame
with
his
dim
ple
and
blue
eyes
and
how
frightened
he
wasl
he
thought
that
i
should
kill
him
.
why
should
i
kill
him
my
hand
trembled
.
and
they
have
given
me
a

but
while
nicholas
was
considering
these
questions
and
still
could
reach
no
clear
solu
tion
of
what
puzzled
him
so
the
wheel
of
for
tune
in
the
service
as
often
happens
turned
in
his
favor
.
after
the
affair
at

was
brought
into
notice

when

was

he
was

chapter
xvi
on
receiving
news
of
natdshas
illness
the
countess
though
not
quite
well
yet
and
still
weak
went
to
moscow
with
pdtya
and
the
rest
of
the
household
and
the
whole
family
moved
from
marya
dmftrievnas
house
to
their
own
and
settled
down
in
town
.
natdshas
illness
was
so
serious
that
fortu
nately
for
her
and
for
her
parents
the
consider
ation
of
all
that
had
caused
the
illness
her
conduct
and
the
breaking
off
of
her
engage
ment
receded
into
the
background
.
she
was
so
ill
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
consid
er
in
how
far
she
was
to
blame
for
what
had
happened
.
she
could
not
eat
or
sleep
grew
visibly
thinner
coughed
and
as
the
doctors
made
them
feel
was
in
danger
.
they
could
not
think
of
anything
but
how
to
help
her
.
doctors
came
to
see
her
singly
and
in
consultation
talked
much
in
french
german
and
latin
blamed
one
another
and
prescribed
a
great
variety
of
medicines
for
all
the
diseases
known
to
them
but
the
simple
idea
never
occurred
to
any
of
them
that
they
could
not
know
the
disease
natasha
was
suffering
from
as
no
dis
ease
suffered
by
a
live
man
can
be
known
for
every
living
person
has
his
own
peculiarities
and
always
has
his
own
peculiar
personal
nov
el
complicated
disease
unknown
to
medicine
not
a
disease
of
the
lungs
liver
skin
heart
nerves
and
so
on
mentioned
in
medical
books
but
a
disease
consisting
of
one
of
the
innumer
able
combinations
of
the
maladies
of
those
or
gans
.
this
simple
thought
could
not
occur
to
the
doctors
as
it
cannot
occur
to
a
wizard
that
he
is
unable
to
work
his
charms
because
the
business
of
their
lives
was
to
cure
and
they
re
ceived
money
for
it
and
had
spent
the
best
years
of
their
lives
on
that
business
.
but
above
all
that
thought
was
kept
out
of
their
minds
by
the
fact
that
they
saw
they
were
really
use
ful
as
in
fact
they
were
to
the
whole
rost6v
family
.
their
usefulness
did
not
depend
on
making
the
patient
swallow
substances
for
the
most
part
harmful
the
harm
was
scarcely
per
ceptible
as
they
were
given
in
small
doses
but
they
were
useful
necessary
and
indispen
sable
because
they
satisfied
a
mental
need
of
the
invalid
and
of
those
who
loved
her
and
that
is
why
there
are
and
always
will
be
pseudohealers
wise
women
homeopaths
and
allopaths
.
they
satisfied
that
eternal
human
need
for
hope
of
relief
for
sympathy
and
that
war
and
peace
something
should
be
done
which
is
felt
by
those
who
are
suffering
.
they
satisfied
the
need
seen
in
its
most
elementary
form
in
a
child
when
it
wants
to
have
a
place
rubbed
that
has
been
hurt
.
a
child
knocks
itself
and
runs
at
once
to
the
arms
of
its
mother
or
nurse
to
have
the
aching
spot
rubbed
or
kissed
and
it
feels
better
when
this
is
done
.
the
child
cannot
believe
that
the
strongest
and
wisest
of
its
peo
ple
have
no
remedy
for
its
pain
and
the
hope
of
relief
and
the
expression
of
its
mothers
sympathy
while
she
rubs
the
bump
comforts
it
.
the
doctors
were
of
use
to
natdsha
because
they
kissed
and
rubbed
her
bump
assuring
her
that
it
would
soon
pass
if
only
the
coach
man
went
to
the
chemists
in
the
arbdt
and
got
a
powder
and
some
pills
in
a
pretty
box
for
a
ruble
and
seventy
kopeks
and
if
she
took
those
powders
in
boiled
water
at
intervals
of
precisely
two
hours
neither
more
nor
less
.
what
would

by
the
clock
the
warm

the
chicken

and
all
the
other

of

ordered
by
the

the
carrying

tion
to

how

not
known
that
it
was
costing
him
a

rubles
and
that
he
would

more
to
benefit
her
or
had
he
not
known
that
if
her
illness
continued
he
would
not
grudge
yet
other
thousands
and
would
take
her
abroad
for

there
and

.
what
would
s6nya
have
done
without
the
glad
consciousness
that
she
had
not
undressed
during
the
first
three
nights
in
order
to
be
ready
to
carry
out
all
the
doctors
injunctions
with
precision
and
that
she
still
kept
awake
at
night
so
as
not
to
miss
the
proper
time
when
book

373
the
slightly
harmful
pills
in
the
little
gilt
box
had
to
be
administered
even
to
natasha
her
self
it
was
pleasant
to
see
that
so
many
sacri
fices
were
being
made
for
her
sake
and
to
know
that
she
had
to
take
medicine
at
certain
hours
though
she
declared
that
no
medicine
would
cure
her
and
that
it
was
all
nonsense
.
and
it
was
even
pleasant
to
be
able
to
show
by
disregard
ing
the
orders
that
she
did
not
believe
in
medi
cal
treatment
and
did
not
value
her
life
.
the
doctor
came
every
day
felt
her
pulse
looked
at
her
tongue
and
regardless
of
her
griefstricken
face
joked
with
her
.
but
when
he
had
gone
into
another
room
to
which
the
countess
hurriedly
followed
him
he
assumed
a
grave
air
and
thoughtfully
shaking
his
head
said
that
though
there
was
danger
he
had
hopes
of
the
effect
of
this
last
medicine
and
one
must
wait
and
see
that
the
malady
was
chiefly
mental
but

.

.

.
and
the
countess
try
ing
to
conceal
the
action
from
herself
and
from
him
slipped
a
gold
coin
into
his
hand
and
al
ways
returned
to
the
patient
with
a
more
tran
quil
mind
.
the
symptoms
of
natdshas
illness
were
that
she
ate
little
slept
little
coughed
and
was
al
ways
lowspirited
.
the
doctors
said
that
she
could
not
get
on
without
medical
treatment
so
they
kept
her
in
the
stifling
atmosphere
of
the
town
and
the
rostovs
did
riot
move
to
the
country
that
summer
of
1812
.
in
spite
of
the
many
pills
she
swallowed
and
the
drops
and
powders
out
of
the
little
bottles
and
boxes
of
which
madame
schoss
who
was
fond
of
such
things
made
a
large
collection
and
in
spite
of
being
deprived
of
the
country
life
to
which
she
was
accustomed
youth
prevailed
.
natdshas
grief
began
to
be
overlaid
by
the
impressions
of
daily
life
it
ceased
to
press
so
painfully
on
her
heart
it
gradually
faded
into
the
past
and
she
began
to
recover
physically
.
chapter
xvii
natasha
was
calmer
but
no
happier
.
she
not
merely
avoided
all
external
forms
of
pleasure
balls
promenades
concerts
and
theaters
but
she
never
laughed
without
a
sound
of
tears
in
her
laughter
.
she
could
not
sing
.
as
soon
as
she
began
to
laugh
or
tried
to
sing
by
herself
tears
choked
her
tears
of
remorse
tears
at
the
recollection
of
those
pure
times
which
could
never
return
tears
of
vexation
that
she
should
so
uselessly
have
ruined
her
young
life
which
might
have
been
so
happy
.
laughter
and
sing
ing
in
particular
seemed
to
her
like
a
blas
phemy
in
face
of
her
sorrow
.
without
any
need
of
selfrestraint
no
wish
to
coquet
ever
entered
her
head
.
she
said
and
felt
at
that
time
that
no
man
was
more
to
her
than
nastisya
ivdnovna
the
buffoon
.
something
stood
senti
nel
within
her
and
forbade
her
every
joy
.
be
sides
she
had
lost
all
the
old
interests
of
her
carefree
girlish
life
that
had
been
so
full
of
hope
.
the
previous
autumn
the
hunting
uncle
and
the
christmas
holidays
spent
with
nicho
las
at
otrddnoe
were
what
she
recalled
often
est
and
most
painfully
.
what
would
she
not
have
given
to
bring
back
even
a
single
day
of
that
timel
but
it
was
gone
forever
.
her
pre
sentiment
at
the
time
had
not
deceived
her
that
that
state
of
freedom
and
readiness
for
any
enjoyment
would
not
return
again
.
yet
it
was
necessary
to
live
on
.
it
comforted
her
to
reflect
that
she
was
not
better
as
she
had
formerly
imagined
but
worse
much
worse
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
.
but
this
was
not
enough
.
she
knew
that
and
asked
herself
what
next
but
there
was
nothing
to
come
.
there
was
no
joy
in
life
yet
life
was
passing
.
natasha
apparently
tried
not
to
be
a
burden
or
a
hindrance
to
anyone
but
wanted
nothing
for
herself
.
she
kept
away
from
everyone
in
the
house
and
felt
at
ease
on
ly
with
her
brother
ptya
.
she
liked
to
be
with
him
better
than
with
the
others
and
when
alone
with
him
she
sometimes
laughed
.
she
hardly
ever
left
the
house
and
of
those
who
came
to
see
them
was
glad
to
see
only
one
per
son
pierre
.
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
treat
her
with
more
delicacy
greater
care
and
at
the
same
time
more
seriously
than
did
count
bezukhov
.
natdsha
unconsciously
felt
this
del
icacy
and
so
found
great
pleasure
in
his
society
.
but
she
was
not
even
grateful
to
him
for
it
nothing
good
on
pierres
part
seemed
to
her
to
be
an
effort
it
seemed
so
natural
for
him
to
be
kind
to
everyone
that
there
was
no
merit
in
his
kindness
.
sometimes
natdsha
noticed
em
barrassment
and
awkwardness
on
his
part
in
her
presence
especially
when
he
wanted
to
do
something
to
please
her
or
feared
that
some
thing
they
spoke
of
would
awaken
memories
distressing
to
her
.
she
noticed
this
and
attrib
uted
it
to
his
general
kindness
and
shyness
which
she
imagined
must
be
the
same
toward
everyone
as
it
was
to
her
.
after
those
involun
tary
words
that
if
he
were
free
he
would
have
asked
on
his
knees
for
her
hand
and
her
love
uttered
at
a
moment
when
she
was
so
strongly
agitated
pierre
never
spoke
to
natdsha
of
his
feelings
and
it
seemed
plain
to
her
that
those
words
which
had
then
so
comforted
her
were
374
spoken
as
all
sorts
of
meaningless
words
are
spoken
to
comfort
a
crying
child
.
it
was
not
be
cause
pierre
was
a
married
man
but
because
natasha
felt
very
strongly
with
him
that
moral
barrier
the
absence
of
which
she
had
experi
enced
with
kuragin
that
it
never
entered
her
head
that
the
relations
between
him
and
her
self
could
lead
to
love
on
her
part
still
less
on
his
or
even
to
the
kind
of
tender
self
conscious
romantic
friendship
between
a
man
and
a
woman
of
which
she
had
known
several
instances
.
before
the
end
of
the
fast
of
st
.
peter

ivdnovna
belova
a
country
neighbor
of
the
rostovs
came
to
moscow
to
pay
her
devo
tions
at
the
shrines
of
the
moscow
saints
.
she
suggested
that
natdsha
should
fast
and
pre
pare
for
holy
communion
and
natasha
glad
ly
welcomed
the
idea
.
despite
the
doctors
or
ders
that
she
should
not
go
out
early
in
the
morning
natasha
insisted
on
fasting
and
pre
paring
for
the
sacrament

as
they
generally
prepared
for
it
in
the
rostov
family

and
not
once
missing
vespers
matins
or
mass
.
the
countess
was
pleased
with
natashas
zeal
after
the
poor
results
of
the
medical
treat
ment
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
she
hoped
that
prayer
might
help
her
daughter
more
than
medicines
and
though
not
without
fear
and
concealing
it
from
the
doctor
she
agreed
to
natashas
wish
and
entrusted
her
to
belova
.
agrafcna
ivanovna
used
to
come
to
wake
na
tasha
at
three
in
the
morning
but
generally
found
her
already
awake
.
she
was
afraid
of
be
ing
late
for
matins
.
hastily
washing
and
meek
ly
putting
on
her
shabbiest
dress
and
an
old
mantilla
natasha
shivering
in
the
fresh
air
went
out
into
the
deserted
streets
lit
by
the
clear
light
of
dawn
.
by
agrafna
ivanovnas
advice
natasha
prepared
herself
not
in
their
own
parish
but
at
a
church
where
according
to
the
devout
agratena
ivanovna
the
priest
was
a
man
of
very
severe
and
lofty
life
.
there
were
never
many
people
in
the
church
nata
sha
always
stood
beside
belova
in
the
customary
place
before
an
icon
of
the
blessed
virgin
let
into
the
screen
before
the
choir
on
the
left
side
and
a
feeling
new
to
her
of
humility
be
fore
something
great
and
incomprehensible
seized
her
when
at
that
unusual
morning
hour
gazing
at
the
dark
face
of
the
virgin
illumi
nated
by
the
candles
burning
before
it
and
by
the
morning
light
falling
from
the
window
war
and
peace
she
listened
to
the
words
of
the
service
which
she
tried
to
follow
with
understanding
.
when
she
understood
them
her
personal
feeling
be
came
interwoven
in
the
prayers
with
shades
of
its
own
.
when
she
did
not
understand
it
was
sweeter
still
to
think
that
the
wish
to
under
stand
everything
is
pride
that
it
is
impossible
to
understand
all
that
it
is
only
necessary
to
believe
and
to
commit
oneself
to
god
whom
she
felt
guiding
her
soul
at
those
moments
.
she
crossed
herself
bowed
low
and
when
she
did
not
understand
in
horror
at
her
own
vileness
simply
asked
god
to
forgive
her
everything
everything
and
to
have
mercy
upon
her
.
the
prayers
to
which
she
surrendered
herself
most
of
all
were
those
of
repentance
.
on
her
way
home
at
an
early
hour
when
she
met
no
one
but
bricklayers
going
to
work
or
men
sweeping
the
street
and
everybody
within
the
houses
was
still
asleep
natdsha
experienced
a
feeling
new
to
her
a
sense
of
the
possibility
of
correcting
her
faults
the
possibility
of
a
new
clean
life
and
of
happiness
.
during
the
whole
week
she
spent
in
this
way
that
feeling
grew
every
day
.
and
the
hap
piness
of
taking
communion
or
communing
as
agrafena
ivdnovna
joyously
playing
with
the
word
called
it
seemed
to
natasha
so
great
that
she
felt
she
should
never
live
till
that
blessed
sunday
.
but
the
happy
day
came
and
on
that
memo
rable
sunday
when
dressed
in
white
muslin
she
returned
home
after
communion
for
the
first
time
for
many
months
she
felt
calm
and
not
oppressed
by
the
thought
of
the
life
that
lay
before
her
.
the
doctor
who
came
to
see
her
that
day
or
dered
her
to
continue
the
powders
he
had
pre
scribed
a
fortnight
previously
.
she
must
certainly
go
on
taking
them

ing

said
he
evidently
sincerely
satisfied
with
his
success
.
only
please

ticular
about
it

be
quite
easy
he
continued
playfully
as
he
adroitly
took
the
gold
coin
in
his
palm
.
she
will
soon
be
singing
and
frolicking
about
.
the
last
medicine
has
done
her
a
very
great
deal
of
good
.
she
has
freshened
up
very
much
.
the
countess
with
a
cheerful
expression
on
her
face
looked
down
at
her
nails
and
spat
a
little
for
luck
as
she
returned
to
the
drawing
room
.
chapter

at
the
beginning
of
july
more
and
more
dis
quieting
reports
about
the
war
began
to
spread
book
nine
in
moscow
people
spoke
of
an
appeal
by
the
emperor
to
the
people
and
of
his
coming
him
self
from
the
army
to
moscow
.
and
as
up
to
the
eleventh
of
july
no
manifesto
or
appeal
had
been
received
exaggerated
reports
became
current
about
them
and
about
the
position
of
russia
.
it
was
said
that
the
emperor
was
leav
ing
the
army
because
it
was
in
danger
it
was
said
that
smolensk
had
surrendered
that
na
poleon
had
an
army
of
a
million
and
only
a
miracle
could
save
russia
.
on
the
eleventh
of
july
which
was
satur
day
the
manifesto
was
received
but
was
not
yet
in
print
and
pierre
who
was
at
the
ros
tovs
promised
to
come
to
dinner
next
day
sunday
and
bring
a
copy
of
the
manifesto
and
appeal
which
he
would
obtain
from
count
rostopchin
.
that
sunday
the
rost6vs
went
to
mass
at
the
razurruvvskis
private
chapel
as
usual
.
it
was
a
hot
july
day
.
even
at
ten
oclock
when
the
rostovs
got
out
of
their
carriage
at
the
chapel
the
sultry
air
the
shouts
of
hawkers
the
light
and
gay
summer
clothes
of
the
crowd
the
dusty
leaves
of
the
trees
on
the
boulevard
the
sounds
of
the
band
and
the
white
trousers
of
a
battalion
marching
to
parade
the
rattling
of
wheels
on
the
cobblestones
and
the
brilliant
hot
sunshine
were
all
full
of
that
summer
lan
guor
that
content
and
discontent
with
the
pres
ent
which
is
most
strongly
felt
on
a
bright
hot
day
in
town
.
all
the
moscow
notabilities
all
the
rost6vs
acquaintances
were
at
the
razu
m6vskis
chapel
for
as
if
expecting
something
to
happen
many
wealthy
families
who
usually
left
town
for
their
country
estates
had
not
gone
away
that
summer
.
as
natasha
at
her
mothers
side
passed
through
the
crowd
be
hind
a
liveried
footman
who
cleared
the
way
for
them
she
heard
a
young
man
speaking
about
her
in
too
loud
a
whisper
.
thats
rostova
the
one
who

..
.
shes
much
thinner
but
all
the
same
shes
prettyl
she
heard
or
thought
she
heard
the
names
of
kuragin
and
bolk6nski
.
but
she
was
always
imagining
that
.
it
always
seemed
to
her
that
everyone
who
looked
at
her
was
thinking
only
of
what
had
happened
to
her
.
with
a
sinking
heart
wretched
as
she
always
was
now
when
she
found
herself
in
a
crowd
natasha
in
her
lilac
silk
dress
trimmed
with
black
lace
walked
as
women
can
walkwith
the
more
repose
and
stateliness
the
greater
the
pain
and
shame
in
her
soul
.
she
knew
for
certain
that
she
was
pretty
but
this
no
longer
gave
her
satisfaction
375
as
it
used
to
.
on
the
contrary
it
tormented
her
more
than
anything
else
of
late
and
particular
ly
so
on
this
bright
hot
summer
day
in
town
.
its
sunday
again
another
week
past
she
thought
recalling
that
she
had
been
here
the
sunday
before
and
always
the
same
life
that
is
no
life
and
the
same
surroundings
in
which
it
used
to
be
so
easy
to
live
.
im
pretty
1myoung
and
i
know
that
now
i
am
good
.
i
used
to
be
bad
but
now
i
know
i
am
good
she
thought
but
yet
my
best
years
are
slipping
by
and
are
no
good
to
anyone
.
she
stood
by
her
mothers
side
and
exchanged
nods
with
acquaintances
near
her
.
from
habit
she
scrutinized
the
ladies
dresses
condemned
the
bearing
of
a
lady
stand
ing
close
by
who
was
not
crossing
herself
prop
erly
but
in
a
cramped
manner
and
again
she
thought
with
vexation
that
she
was
herself
be
ing
judged
and
was
judging
others
and
sud
denly
at
the
sound
of
the
service
she
felt
hor
rified
at
her
own
vileness
horrified
that
the
former
purity
of
her
soul
was
again
lost
to
her
.
a
comely
freshlooking
old
man
was
con
ducting
the
service
with
that
mild
solemnity
which
has
so
elevating
and
soothing
an
effect
on
the
souls
of
the
worshipers
.
the
gates
of
the
sanctuary
screen
were
closed
the
curtain
was
slowly
drawn
and
from
behind
it
a
soft
myste
rious
voice
pronounced
some
words
.
tears
the
cause
of
which
she
herself
did
not
understand
made
natdshas
breast
heave
and
a
joyous
but
oppressive
feeling
agitated
her
.
teach
me
what
i
should
do
how
to
live
my
life
how
i
may
grow
good
forever
forever
she
pleaded
.
the
deacon
came
out
onto
the
raised
space
before
the
altar
screen
and
holding
his
thumb
extended
drew
his
long
hair
from
under
his
dalmatic
and
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
breast
began
in
a
loud
and
solemn
voice
to
recite
the
words
of
the
prayer
.

.

.

.
in
peace
let
us
pray
unto
the
lord
.
as
one
community
without
distinction
of
class
without
enmity
united
by
brotherly
love
let
us
prayl
thought
natasha
.
for
the
peace
that
is
from
above
and
for
the
salvation
of
our
souls
.
for
the
world
of
angels
and
all
the
spirits
who
dwell
above
us
prayed
natdsha
.
when
they
prayed
for
the
warriors
she
thought
of
her
brother
and
denisov
.
when
they
prayed
for
all
traveling
by
land
and
sea
she
remembered
prince
andrew
prayed
for
him
and
asked
god
to
forgive
her
all
the
wrongs
she
had
done
him
.
when
they
prayed
for
those
who
love
us
she
prayed
for
the
mem
376
war
and
peace
bers
of
her
own
family
her
father
and
mother
and
sonya
realizing
for
the
first
time
how
wrongly
she
had
acted
toward
them
and
feel
ing
all
the
strength
of
her
love
for
them
.
when
they
prayed
for
those
who
hate
us
she
tried
to
think
of
her
enemies
and
people
who
hated
her
in
order
to
pray
for
them
.
she
included
among
her
enemies
the
creditors
and
all
who
had
business
dealings
with
her
father
and
al
ways
at
the
thought
of
enemies
and
those
who
hated
her
she
remembered
anatole
who
had
done
her
so
much
harmand
though
he
did
not
hate
her
she
gladly
prayed
for
him
as
for
an
enemy
.
only
at
prayer
did
she
feel
able
to
think
clearly
and
calmly
of
prince
andrew
and
anatole
as
men
for
whom
her
feelings
were
as
nothing
compared
with
her
awe
and
devotion
to
god
.
when
they
prayed
for
the
imperial
family
and
the
synod
she
bowed
very
low
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
saying
to
herself
that
even
if
she
did
not
understand
still
she
could
not
doubt
and
at
any
rate
loved
the
govern
ing
synod
and
prayed
for
it
.
when
he
had
finished
the
litany
the
deacon
crossed
the
stole
over
his
breast
and
said
let
us
commit
ourselves
and
our
whole
lives
to
christ
the
lord
commit
ourselves
to
god
natdsha
in
wardly
repeated
.

me

to

and
how
to

prayed
natasha
with
impatient
emotion
in
her
heart
not
crossing
herself
but
letting
her
slender
arms
hang
down
as
if
expecting
some
invisible
pow
er
at
any
moment
to
take
her
and
deliver
her
from
herself
from
her
regrets
desires
remorse
hopes
and
sins
.
the
countess
looked
round
several
times
at
her
daughters
softened
face
and
shining
eyes
and
prayed
god
to
help
her
.
unexpectedly
in
the
middle
of
the
service
and
not
in
the
usual
order
natasha
knew
so
well
the
deacon
brought
out
a
small
stool
the
one
he
knelt
on
when
praying
on
trinity
sun
day
and
placed
it
before
the
doors
of
the
sanc
tuary
screen
.
the
priest
came
out
with
his
pur
ple
velvet
biretta
on
his
head
adjusted
his
hair
and
knelt
down
with
an
effort
.
every
body
followed
his
example
and
they
looked
at
one
another
in
surprise
.
then
came
the
prayer
just
received
from
the
synod
a
prayer
for
the
deliverance
of
russia
from
hostile
invasion
.

the

in
that
voice

diloquent

mild
in
which
only

read
and
which
acts
so
irresistibly

world
without

.
amen
.
in
natashas
receptive
condition
of
soul
this
prayer
affected
her
strongly
.
she
listened
to
ev
ery
word
about
the
victory
of
moses
over
am
alekof
gideon
over
midianand
of
david
over
goliath
and
about
the
destruction
of
thy
jerusalem
and
she
prayed
to
god
with
the
tenderness
and
emotion
with
which
her
heart
was
overflowing
but
without
fully
understand
ing
what
she
was
asking
of
god
in
that
prayer
.
she
shared
with
all
her
heart
in
the
prayer
for
the
spirit
of
righteousness
for
the
strengthen
ing
of
the
heart
by
faith
and
hope
and
its
an
imation
by
love
.
but
she
could
not
pray
that
her
enemies
might
be
trampled
under
foot
when
but
a
few
minutes
before
she
had
been
wishing
she
had
more
of
them
that
she
might
pray
for
them
.
but
neither
could
she
doubt
the
righteousness
of
the
prayer
that
was
being
read
on
bended
knees
.
she
felt
in
her
heart
a
devout
and
tremulous
awe
at
the
thought
of
the
punishment
that
overtakes
men
for
their
sins
and
especially
of
her
own
sins
and
she
prayed
to
god
to
forgive
them
all
and
her
too
and
to
give
them
all
and
her
too
peace
and
happiness
.
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
god
heard
her
prayer
.
chapter
xix
from
the
day
when
pierre
after
leaving
the
rost6vs
with
natashas
grateful
look
fresh
in
his
mind
had
gazed
at
the
comet
that
seemed
to
be
fixed
in
the
sky
and
felt
that
something
new
was
appearing
on
his
own
horizon
from
that
day
the
problem
of
the
vanity
and
uselessness
of
all
earthly
things
that
had
incessantly
tor
mented
him
no
longer
presented
itself
.
that
terrible
question
why
wherefore
which
had
come
to
him
amid
every
occupation
was
now
replaced
not
by
another
question
or
by
a
reply
to
the
former
question
but
by
her
image
.
when
he
listened
to
or
himself
took
part
in
trivial
conversations
when
he
read
or
heard
of
human
baseness
or
folly
he
was
not
horri
fied
as
formerly
and
did
not
ask
himself
why
men
struggled
so
about
these
things
when
all
is
so
transient
and
incomprehensiblebut
he
remembered
her
as
he
had
last
seen
her
and
all
his
doubts
vanished
not
because
she
had
answered
the
questions
that
had
haunted
him
but
because
his
conception
of
her
transferred
him
instantly
to
another
a
brighter
realm
of
spiritual
activity
in
which
no
one
could
be
jus
tified
or
guilty
a
realm
of
beauty
and
love
which
it
was
worth
living
for
.
whatever
world
ly
baseness
presented
itself
to
him
he
said
to
himself
well
supposing
n
.
n
.
has
swindled
the
country
and
the
tsar
and
the
country
and
the
tsar
confer
honors
upon
him
what
does
that
matter
she
smiled
at
me
yesterday
and
asked
me
to
come
again
and
i
love
her
and
no
one
will
ever
know
it
.
and
his
soul
felt
calm
and
peaceful
.
pierre
still
went
into
society
drank
as
much
and
led
the
same
idle
and
dissipated
life
be
cause
besides
the
hours
he
spent
at
the
ros
t6vs
there
were
other
hours
he
had
to
spend
somehow
and
the
habits
and
acquaintances
he
had
made
in
moscow
formed
a
current
that
bore
him
along
irresistibly
.
but
latterly
when
more
and
more
disquieting
reports
came
from
the
seat
of
war
and
natashas
health
began
to
improve
and
she
no
longer
aroused
in
him
the
former
feeling
of
careful
pity
an
everincreas
ing
restlessness
which
he
could
not
explain
took
possession
of
him
.
he
felt
that
the
condi
tion
he
was
in
could
not
continue
long
that
a
catastrophe
was
coming
which
would
change
his
whole
life
and
he
impatiently
sought
ev
erywhere
for
signs
of
that
approaching
catas
trophe
.
one
of
his
brother
masons
had
re
vealed
to
pierre
the
following
prophecy
con
cerning
napoleon
drawn
from
the
revelation
of
st
.
john
.
in

13
verse

of
the
apocalypse
it
is
said
here

let
him
that
hath
un
derstanding
count
the
number
of
the
beast
for
it
is
the
number
of
a
man
and
his
number
is
six
hundred
threescore
and
six
.
and
in
the
fifth
verse
of
the
same
chapter
and
there
was
given
unto
him
a
mouth
speaking
great
things
and
blasphemies
378
and
power
was
given
unto
him
to
contin
ue
forty
and
two
months
.
the
french
alphabet
written
out
with
the
same
numerical
values
as

hebrew

nine
letters
denote

and

what
means

was

with
the

he
did

he
did
not

all
this
had
to
mature
and
culminate
to
lift
him
out
of
that
spellbound
petty
sphere
of
moscow
habits
in
which
he
felt
himself
held
captive
and
lead
him
to
a
great

writing
the
words
lempereur
napoleon
in
numbers
it
appears
that
the
sum
of
them
is
666
1
and
that
napoleon
was
therefore
the
beast
foretold
in
the
apocalypse
.
moreover
by
ap
plying
the
same
system
to
the
words
quarante
deuxf
which
was
the
term
allowed
to
the
beast
that
spoke
great
things
and
blasphemies
the
same
number
666
was
obtained
from
which
it
followed
that
the
limit
fixed
for
napoleons
power
had
come
in
the
year
1812
when
the
french
emperor
was
fortytwo
.
this
prophecy
pleased
pierre
very
much
and
he
often
asked
himself
what
would
put
an
end
to
the
power
of
the
beast
that
is
of
napoleon
and
tried
by
the
same
system
of
using
letters
as
numbers
and
adding
them
up
to
find
an
answer
to
the
ques
tion
that
engrossed
him
.
he
wrote
the
words
lempereur
alexandre
la
nation
russe
and
added
up
their
numbers
but
the
sums
were
either
more
or
less
than
666
.
once
when
mak
ing
such
calculations
he
wrote
down
his
own
name
in
french
comte
pierre
besouhoff
but
the
sum
of
the
numbers
did
not
come
right
.
then
he
changed
the
spelling
substituting
a
z
for
the
s
and
adding
de
and
the
article
le
still
without
obtaining
the
desired
result
.
then
it
occurred
to
him
if
the
answer
to
the
question
were
contained
in
his
name
his
nationality
would
also
be
given
in
the
answer
.
so
he
wrote
le
russe
besuhof
and
adding
up
the
numbers
got
671
.
this
was
only
five
too
much
and
five
was
represented
by
e
the
very
letter
elided
from
the
article
le
before
the
word
empereur
.
by
omitting
the
e
though
incorrectly
pierre
got
the
answer
he
sought
.
lrusse

made
666
.
this
discovery
excited
him
.

.
on
the
eve
of
the
sunday
when
the
special
prayer
was
read
pierre
had
promised
the
ros
t6vs
to
bring
them
from
count
rostopchfn
whom
he
knew
well
both
the
appeal
to
the
people
and
the
latest
news
from
the
army
.
in
the
morning
when
he
went
to
call
at
rostop
chins
he
met
there
a
courier
fresh
from
the
ar
my
an
acquaintance
of
his
own
who
often
danced
at
moscow
balls
.
do
please
for
heavens
sake
relieve
me
of
something
said
the
courier
.
i
have
a
sackful
of
letters
to
parents
.
among
these
letters
wat
one
from
nicholas
rost6vto
his
father
.
pierre
took
that
letter
and
rostopchfn
also
gave
him
the
emperors
ap
peal
to
moscow
which
had
just
been
printed
the
last
army
orders
and
his
own
most
recent
bulletin
.
glancing
through
the
army
orders
pierre
found
in
one
of
them
in
the
lists
of
killed
wounded
and
rewarded
the
name
of
nicholas
rost6v
awarded
a
st
.
georges
cross
of
the
fourth
class
for
courage
shown
in
the
ostr6v
na
affair
and
in
the
same
order
the
name
of
prince
andrew
bolk6nski
appointed
to
the
command
of
a
regiment
of
chasseurs
.
though
he
did
not
want
to
remind
the
rost6vs
of
bol
k6nski
pierre
could
not
refrain
from
making
them
happy
by
the
news
of
their
sons
having
received
a
decoration
so
he
sent
that
printed
army
order
and
nicholas
letter
to
the
rost6vs
keeping
the
appeal
the
bulletin
and
the
other
orders
to
take
with
him
when
he
went
to
din
ner
.
his
conversation
with
count
rostopchin
and
the
latters
toneof
anxious
hurry
the
meet
ing
with
the
courier
who
talked
casually
of
how
badly
things
were
going
in
the
army
the
ru
mors
of
the
disco
very
of
spies
in
moscow
and
of
a
leaflet
in
circulation
stating
that
napoleon
promised
to
be
in
both
the
russian
capitals
by
the
autumn
and
the
talk
of
the
emperors
being
expected
to
arrive
next
day
all
aroused
with
fresh
force
that
feeling
of
agitation
and
expec
tation
in
pierre
which
he
had
been
conscious
book
nine
of
ever
since
the
appearance
of
the
comet
and
especially
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
.
he
had
long
been
thinking
of
enter
ing
the
ar
my
and
would
have
done
so
had
he
not
been
hindered
first
by
his
membership
of
the
society
of
freemasons
to
which
he
was
bound
by
oath
and
which
preached
perpetual
peace
and
the
ab
olition
of
war
and
secondly
by
the
fact
that
when
he
saw
the
great
mass
of
muscovites
who
had
donned
uniform
and
were
talking
patriot
ism
he
somehow
felt
ashamed
to
take
the
step
.
but
the
chief
reason
for
not
carrying
out
his
intention
to
enter
the
army
lay
in
the
vague
idea
that
he
was
lrusse
besuhof
who
had
the
number
of
the
beast
666
that
his
part
in
the
great
affair
of
setting
a
limit
to
the
power
of
the
beast
that
spoke
great
and
blasphemous
things
had
been
predestined
from
eternity
and
that
therefore
he
ought
not
to
undertake
any
thing
but
wait
for
what
was
bound
to
come
to
pass
.
chapter
xx
a
few
intimate
friends
were
dining
with
the
rost6vs
that
day
as
usual
on
sundays
.
pierre
came
early
so
as
to
find
them
alone
.
he
had
grown
so
stout
this
year
that
he
would
have
been
abnormal
had
he
not
been
so
tall
so
broad
of
limb
and
so
strong
that
he
car
ried
his
bulk
with
evident
ease
.
he
went
up
the
stairs
puffing
and
muttering
something
.
his
coachman
did
not
even
ask
whether
he
was
to
wait
.
he
knew
that
when
his
master
was
at
the
rost6vs
he
stayed
till
mid
night
.
the
rost6vs
footman
rushed
eagerly
forward
to
help
him
off
with
his
cloak
and
take
his
hat
and
stick
.
pierre
from
club
habit
al
ways
left
both
hat
and
stick
in
the
anteroom
.
the
first
person
he
saw
in
the
house
was
na
tasha
.
even
before
he
saw
her
while
taking
off
his
cloak
he
heard
her
.
she
was
practicing
sol
fa
exercises
in
the
music
room
.
he
knew
that
she
had
not
sung
since
her
illness
and
so
the
sound
of
her
voice
surprised
and
delighted
him
.
he
opened
the
door
softly
and
saw
her
in
the
lilac
dress
she
had
worn
at
church
walking
about
the
room
singing
.
she
had
her
back
to
him
when
he
opened
the
door
but
when
turn
ing
quickly
she
saw
his
broad
surprised
face
she
blushed
and
came
rapidly
up
to
him
.
i
want
to
try
to
sing
again
she
said
add
ing
as
if
by
way
of
excuse
it
is
at
least
some
thing
to
do
thats
capital
how
glad
i
am
youve
come
i
am
so
hap
py
today
she
said
with
the
old
animation
379
pierre
had
not
seen
in
her
for
a
long
time
.
you
know
nicholas
has
received
a
st
.
georges
cross
i
am
so
proud
of
him
.
oh
yes
i
sent
that
announcement
.
but
i
dont
want
to
interrupt
you
he
added
and
was
about
to
go
to
the
drawing
room
.
natasha
stopped
him
.
count
is
it
wrong
of
me
to
sing
she
said
blushing
and
fixing
her
eyes
inquiringly
on
him
.
no

.

.

.
why
should
it
be
on
the
contrary

.

.

.
but
why
do
you
ask
me
i
dont
know
myself
natdsha
answered
quickly
but
i
should
not
like
to
do
anything
you
disapproved
of
.
i
believe
in
you
complete
ly
.
you
dont
know
how
important
you
are
to
me
how
much
youve
done
for
me
.

..
.
she
spoke
rapidly
and
did
not
notice
how
pierre
flushed
at
her
words
.
i
saw
in
that
same
army
order
that
he
bolk6nski
she
whispered
the
name
hastily
is
in
russia
and
in
the
army
again
.
what
do
you
think
she
was
speaking
hurriedly
evidently
afraid
her
strength
might
fail
her
will
he
ever
forgive
me
will
he
not
always
have
a
bitter
feeling
toward
me
what
do
you
think
what
do
you
think
i
think

.

.

.
pierre
replied
that
he
has
nothing
to
forgive
if
i
were
in
his
place

.

.

.
by
association
of
ideas
pierre
was
at
once
carried
back
to
the
day
when
trying
to
com
fort
her
he
had
said
that
if
he
were
not
him
self
but
the
best
man
in
the
world
and
free
he
would
ask
on
his
knees
for
her
hand
and
the
same
feeling
of
pity
tenderness
and
love
took
possession
of
him
and
the
same
words
rose
to
his
lips
.
but
she
did
not
give
him
time
to
say
them
.
yes
you

.

.

.
you

.

.

.
she
said
uttering
the
word
you
rapturously
thats
a
different
thing
.
i
know
no
one
kinder
more
generous
or
bet
ter
than
you
nobody
could
be
had
you
not
been
there
then
and
now
too
i
dont
know
what
would
have
become
of
me
because

.

.

.
tears
suddenly
rose
in
her
eyes
she
turned
away
lifted
her
music
before
her
eyes
began
singing
again
and
again
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
.
just
then
ptya
came
running
in
from
the
drawing
room
.
ptkya
was
now
a
handsome
rosy
lad
of
fifteen
with
full
red
lips
and
resembled
natasha
.
he
was
preparing
to
enter
the
university
but
he
and
his
friend
obotenski
had
lately
in
secret
agreed
to
join
the
hussars
.
ptya
had
come
rushing
out
to
talk
to
hia
namesake
about
this
affair
.
he
had
asked
380
war
and
peace
pierre
to
find
out
whether
he
would
be
accepted
in
the
hussars
.
pierre
walked
up
and
down
the
drawing
room
not
listening
to
what
ptya
was
saying
.
petya
pulled
him
by
the
arm
to
attract
his
attention
.
well
what
about
my
plan
peter
kirttych
for
heavens
sake
you
are
my
only
hope
i
said
pekya
.
oh
yes

plan

the
hussars

pierre

exclaimed
the
count
.
where

the
manifesto
the
emperors
appeal
oh
yes
pierre
began
feeling
in
his
pockets
for
the
papers
but
could
not
find
them
.
still
slapping
his
pockets
he
kissed
the
hand
of
the
countess
who
entered
the
room
and
glanced
uneasily
around
evidently
expecting
natasha
who
had
left
off
singing
but
had
not
yet
come
into
the
drawing
room
.
on
my
word
i
dont

it
he
said
.
there
he
is
always
losing
everything
re
marked
the
countess
.
natasha
entered
with
a
softened
and
agitat
ed
expression
of
face
and
sat
down
looking
si
lently
at
pierre
.
as
soon
as
she
entered
pierres
features
which
had
been
gloomy
suddenly
lighted
up
and
while
still
searching
for
the
pa
pers
he
glanced
at
her
several
times
.
no
really
ill

i
must

.

.

.

.
but
youll

.
oh

my
coachman

gone
.
but
s6nya
who
had
gone
to
look
for
the
pa
pers
in
the
anteroom
had
found
them
in
pierres
hat
where
he
had
carefully
tucked
them
under
the
lining
.
pierre
was
about
to
be
gin
reading
.
no
after
dinner
said
the
old
count
evi
dently
expecting
much
enjoyment
from
that
reading
.
at
dinner
at
which
champagne
was
drunk
to
the
health
of
the
new
chevalier
of
st
.
george
shinshfn
told
them
the
town
news
of
the
ill
ness
of
the
old
georgian
princess
of
mdtiviers
disappearance
from
moscow
and
of
how
some
german
fellow
had
been
brought
to
rostop
chin
and
accused
of
being
a
french
spyer
so
count
rostopchin
had
told
thestoryand
how
rostopchfn
let
him
go
and
assured
the
people
that
he
was
not
a
spire
at
all
but
only
an
old
german
ruin
.
people
are
being
arrested

.

.

.
said
the
count
.
ive
told
the
countess
she
should
not
speak
french
so
much
.
its
not
the
time
for
it
now
.
and
have
you
heard
shinshin
asked
.
prince
golitsyn
has
engaged
a
master
to
teach
him
russian
.
it
is
becoming
dangerous
to
speak
french
in
the
streets
.
and
how
about
you
count
peter
kirilych
if
they
call
up
the
militia
you
too
will
have
to
mount
a
horse
remarked
the
old
count
ad
dressing
pierre
.
pierre
had
been
silent
and
preoccupied
all
through
dinner
seeming
not
to
grasp
what
was
said
.
he
looked
at
the
count
.
oh
yes
the
war
he
said
.
no
what
sort
of
warrior
should
i
make
and
yet
everything
is
so
strange
so
strange
i
cant
make
it
out
.
i
dont
know
i
am
very
far
from
having
military
tastes
but
in
these
times
no
one
can
answer
for
himself
.
after
dinner
the
count
settled
himself
com
fortably
in
an
easy
chair
and
with
a
serious
face
asked
sonya
who
was
considered
an
ex
cellent
reader
to
read
the
appeal
.
to
moscow
our
ancient
capital
the
enemy
has
entered
the
borders
of
russia
with
immense
forces
.
he
comes
to
despoil
our
be
loved
country
sonya
read
painstakingly
in
her
highpitched
voice
.
the
count
listened
with
closed
eyes
heaving
abrupt
sighs
at
certain
passages
.
natasha
sat
erect
gazing
with
a
searching
look
now
at
her
father
and
now
at
pierre
.
pierre
felt
her
eyes
on
him
and
tried
not
to
look
round
.
the
countess
shook
her
head
dis
approvingly
and
angrily
at
every
solemn
expres
sion
in
the
manifesto
.
in
all
these
words
she
saw
only
that
the
danger
threatening
her
son
would
not
soon
be
over
.
shinshin
with
a
sar
castic
smile
on
his
lips
was
evidently
preparing
to
make
fun
of
anything
that
gave
him
the
op
portunity
s6nyas
reading
any
remark
of
the
counts
or
even
the
manifesto
itself
should
no
better
pretext
present
itself
.
book
after
reading
about
the
dangers
that
threat
ened
russia
the
hopes
the
emperor
placed
on
moscow
and
especially
on
its
illustrious
nobil
ity
s6nya
with
a
quiver
in
her
voice
due
chief
ly
to
the
attention
that
was
being
paid
to
her
read
the
last
words
we
ourselves
will
not
delay
to
appear
among
our
people
in
that
capital
and
in
others
parts
of
our
realm
for
consultation
and
for
the
direction
of
all
our
levies
both
those
now
barring
the
ene
mys
path
and
those
freshly
formed
to
defeat
him
wherever
he
may
appear
.
may
the
ruin
he
hopes
to
bring
upon
us
recoil
on
his
own
head
and
may
europe
delivered
from
bondage
glorify
the
name
of
russia
yes
thats
itl
cried
the
count
opening
his
moist
eyes
and
sniffing
repeatedly
as
if
a
strong
vinaigrette
had
been
held
to
his
nose
and
he
added
let
the
emperor
but
say
the
word
and
well
sacrifice
everything
and
begrudge
noth
ing
.
before
shinshin
had
time
to
utter
the
joke
he
was
ready
to
make
on
the
counts
patriotism
natdsha
jumped
up
from
her
place
and
ran
to
her
father
.
what
a
darling
our
papa
isl
she
cried
kiss
ing
him
and
she
again
looked
at
pierre
with
the
unconscious
coquetry
that
had
returned
to
her
with
her
better
spirits
.
there
heres
a
patriot
for
you
said
shin
shin
.
not
a
patriot
at
all
but
simply

.

.

.
natdsha
replied
in
an
injured
tone
.
everything
seems
funny
to
you
but
this
isnt
at
all
a
joke
.

.

.

.
a
joke
indeed
put
in
the
count
.
let
him
but
say
the
word
and
well
all
go
.

..
.
were
not
germansl
but
did
you
notice
it
says
for
consulta
tion
said
pierre
.
never
mind
what
its
for
.

.

.

.
at
this
moment
ptya
to
whom
nobody
was
praying
any
attention
came
up
to
his
father
with
a
very
flushed
face
and
said
in
his
breaking
voice
that
was
now
deep
and
now
shrill
well
papa
i
tell
you
definitely
and
mam
ma
too
its
as
you
please
but
i
say
definitely
that
you
must
let
me
enter
the
army
because
i
cant

.

.

.
thats
all
.

.

.

.
the
countess
in
dismay
looked
up
to
heav
en
clasped
her
hands
and
turned
angrily
to
her
husband
.
that
comes
of
your
talking
said
she
.
but
the
count
had
already
recovered
from
his
excitement
.

he
.

when

.

.

.
petya
stopped
short
flushed
till
he
perspired
but
still
got
out
the
words
when
our
fatherland
is
in
danger
.
thatll
do
thatll
do

.

.

.

.
but

said
yourself
that
we
would
sacri
fice
everything
.
pckya

quiet

cried
the
count
with
a
glance
at
his
wife
who
had
turned
pale
and
was
staring
fixedly
at
her
son
.
and
i
tell
you
peter
kirttych
here

.

.

.

dried
on
your
lips
and
you
want
to
go
into
the
army
there
there
i
tell
you
and
the
count
moved
to
go
out
of
the
room
taking
the
papers
probably
to
reread
them
in
his
study
before
having
a
nap
.
well
peter
kiiilych
lets
go
and
have
a
smoke
he
said
.
pierre
was
agitated
and
undecided
.
natashas
unwontedly
brilliant
eyes
continually
glancing
at
him
with
a
more
than
cordial
look
had
re
duced
him
to
this
condition
.
no
i
think
ill
go
home
.
home
why
you
meant
to
spend
the
eve
ning
with

.

..
.
you
dont
often
come
nowa
days
as
it
is
and
this
girl
of
mine
said
the
count
goodnaturedly
pointing
to
natasha
only
brightens
up
when
youre

.

..
.

.

.
said
pierre
hur
riedly
.
well
then
au
revoir
said
the
count
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
why
are
you
going
why
are
you
upset
asked
natdsha
and
she
looked
challengingly
into
pierres
eyes
.
because
i
love
you
was
what
he
wanted
to
say
but
he
did
not
say
it
and
only
blushed
till
the
tears
came
and
lowered
his
eyes
.
because
it
is
better
forme
to
come
less
of
ten

.

.

.
because

.

.

.
no
simply
i
have
business

why
no
tell
me
natdsha
began
resolute
ly
and
suddenly
stopped
.
they
looked
at
each
other
with
dismayed
and
embarrassed
faces
.
he
tried
to
smile
but
could
not
his
smile
expressed
suffering
and
he
silently
kissed
her
hand
and
went
out
.
pierre
made
up
his
mind
not
to
go
to
the
ros
t6vs
any
more
.

and

chapter
xxi
after
the
definite
refusal
he
had
received
pet
ya
went
to
his
room
and
there
locked
himself
in
and
wept
bitterly
.
when
he
came
in
to
tea
silent
morose
and
with
tearstained
face
every
body
pretended
not
to
notice
anything
.
next
day
the
emperor
arrived
in
moscow
and
several
of
the
rost6vs
domestic
serfs
begged
permission
to
go
to
have
a
look
at
him
.
that
morning
pckya
was
a
long
time
dressing
and
arranging
his
hair
and
collar
to
look
like
a
grownup
man
.
he
frowned
before
his
look
ing
glass
gesticulated
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
finally
without
saying
a
word
to
anyone
took
his
cap
and
left
the
house
by
the
back
door
trying
to
avoid
notice
.
phya
decided
to
go
straight
to
where
the
emperor
was
and
to
explain
frankly
to
some
gentlemaninwaiting
he
imagined
the
emperor
to
be
always
sur
rounded
by
gentlemeninwaiting
that
he
count
rost6v
in
spite
of
his
youth
wished
to
serve
his
country
that
youth
could
be
no
hin
drance
to
loyalty
and
that
he
was
ready
to

..
.
while
dressing
pctya
had
prepared
many
fine
things
he
meant
to
say
to
the
gentlemanin
waiting
.
it
was
on
the
very
fact
of
being
so
young
that
pehya
counted
for
success
in
reaching
the
emperor
he
even
thought
how
surprised
every
one
would
be
at
his
youthfulriess
and
yet
in
the
arrangement
of
his
collar
and
hair
and
by
his
sedate
deliberate
walk
he
wished
to
appear
a
grownup
man
.
but
the
farther
he
went
and
the
more
his
attention
was
diverted
by
the
everincreasing
crowds
moving
toward
the
kremlin
the
less
he
remembered
to
walk
with
the
sedateness
and
deliberation
of
a
man
.
as
he
approached
the
kremlin
he
even
began
to
avoid
being
crushed
and
resolutely
stuck
out
his
elbows
in
a
menacing
way
.
but
within
the
trinity
gateway
he
was
so
pressed
to
the
wall
by
people
who
probably
were
unaware
of
the
patriotic
intentions
with
which
he
had
come
that
in
spite
of
all
his
determination
he
had
to
give
in
and
stop
while
carriages
passed
in
rumbling
beneath
the
archway
.
beside
petya
stood
a
peasant
woman
a
footman
two
trades
men
and
a
discharged
soldier
.
after
standing
some
time
in
the
gateway
ptftya
tried
to
move
forward
in
front
of
the
others
without
waiting
for
all
the
carriages
to
pass
and
he
began
reso
lutely
working
his
way
with
his
elbows
but
the
woman
just
in
front
of
him
who
was
the
first
against
whom
he
directed
his
efforts
angrily
shouted
at
him
what
are
you
shoving
for
young
lordling
dont
you
see
were
all
standing
still
then
why
push
anybody
can
shove
said
the
footman
and
also
began
working
his
elbows
to
such
effect
that
he
pushed
ptya
into
a
very
filthy
corner
of
the
gateway
.
p6tya
wiped
his
perspiring
face
with
his
hands
and
pulled
up
the
damp
collar
which
he
had
arranged
so
well
at
home
to
seem
like
a
mans
.
he
felt
that
he
no
longer
looked
presentable
and
feared
that
if
he
were
now
to
approach
the
gentlemeninwaiting
in
that
plight
he
would
not
be
admitted
to
the
emperor
.
but
it
was
impossible
to
smarten
oneself
up
or
move
to
another
place
because
of
the
crowd
.
one
of
the
generals
who
drove
past
was
an
acquaint
ance
of
the
rostcws
and
ptya
thought
of
ask
ing
his
help
but
came
to
the
conclusion
that
that
would
not
be
a
manly
thing
to
do
.
when
the
carriages
had
all
passed
in
the
crowd
car
rying
ptya
with
it
streamed
forward
into
the
krdmlin
square
which
was
already
full
of
peo
ple
.
there
were
people
not
only
in
the
square
but
everywhere
on
the
slopes
and
on
the
roofs
.
as
soon
as
ptftya
found
himself
in
the
square
he
clearly
heard
the
sound
of
bells
and
the
joy
ous
voices
of
the
crowd
that
filled
the
whole
kremlin
.
for
a
while
the
crowd
was
less
dense
but
suddenly
all
heads
were
bared
and
everyone
rushed
forward
in
one
direction
.
pc
tya
was
be
ing
pressed
so
that
he
could
scarcely
breathe
and
everybody
shouted
hurrah
hurrah
hur
rah
petya
stood
on
tiptoe
and
pushed
and
pinched
but
could
see
nothing
except
the
peo
ple
about
him
.
all
the
faces
bore
the
same
expression
of
ex
citement
and
enthusiasm
.
a
tradesmans
wife
standing
beside
petya
sobbed
and
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
.
father
angel
dear
one
she
kept
repeat
ing
wiping
away
her
tears
with
her
fingers
.
hurrah
was
heard
on
all
sides
.
for
a
moment
the
crowd
stood
still
but
then
it
made
another
rush
forward
.
quite
beside
himself
ptya
clinching
his
teeth
and
rolling
his
eyes
ferociously
pushed
forward
elbowing
his
way
and
shouting
hur
rah
as
if
he
were
prepared
that
instant
to
kill
himself
and
everyone
else
but
on
both
sides
of
him
other
people
with
similarly
ferocious
faces
pushed
forward
and
every
body
shouted
hurrah
so
this
is
what
the
emperor
is
i
thought
pehya
.
no
i
cant
petition
him
myself
that
book
nine
383
would
be
too
bold
.
but
in
spite
of
this
he
con
tinued
to
struggle
desperately
forward
and
from
between
the
backs
of
those
in
front
he
caught
glimpses
of
an
open
space
with
a
strip
of
red
cloth
spread
out
on
it
but
just
then
the
crowd
swayed
back
the
police
in
front
were
pushing
back
those
who
had
pressed
too
close
to
the
procession
the
emperor
was
passing
from
the
palace
to
the
cathedral
of
the
as
sumptionand
pkya
unexpectedly
received
such
a
blow
on
his
side
and
ribs
and
was
squeezed
so
hard
that
suddenly
everything
grew
dim
before
his
eyes
and
he
lost
conscious
ness
.
when
he
came
to
himself
a
man
of
cleri
cal
appearance
with
a
tuft
of
gray
hair
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
wearing
a
shabby
blue
cassock
probably
a
church
clerk
and
chanter
was
holding
him
under

several
people
were

for

suddenly
a

turned
toward

and
pressed
round
him

those
who
stood

the

at

while
the
service
was
proceeding
in
the
cathedral
of
the

it
was
a
com
bined
service
of
prayer
on
the
occasion
of
the
emperors
arrival
and
of
thanksgiving
for
the
conclusion
of

tr
.
ordinary
conversation
could
again
be
heard
.
a
tradesmans
wife
was
showing
a
rent
in
her
shawl
and
telling
how
much
the
shawl
had
cost
another
was
saying
that
all
silk
goods
had
now
got
dear
.
the
clerk
who
had
rescued
pt
yawas
talking
to
a
functionary
about
the
priests
who
were
officiating
that
day
with
the
bishop
.
the
clerk
several
times
used
the
word
plena
ry
of
the
service
a
word
ptya
did
not
un
derstand
.
two
young
citizens
were
joking
with
some
serf
girls
who
were
cracking
nuts
.
all
these
conversations
especially
the
joking
with
the
girls
were
such
as
might
have
had
a
par
ticular
charm
for
ptya
at
his
age
but
they
did
not
interest
him
now
.
he
sat
on
his
elevation
the
pedestal
of
the
cannon
still
agitated
as
be
fore
by
the
thought
of
the
emperor
and
by
his
love
for
him
.
the
feeling
of
pain
and
fear
he
had
experienced
when
he
was
being
crushed
together
with
that
of
rapture
still
further
in
tensified
his
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
oc
casion
.
suddenly
the
sound
of
a
firing
of
cannon
was
heard
from
the
embankment
to
celebrate
the
signing
of
peace
with
the
turks
and
the
crowd
rushed
impetuously
toward
the
embank
ment
to
watch
the
firing
.
petya
too
would
have
run
there
but
the
clerk
who
had
taken
the
young
gentleman
under
his
protection
stopped
him
.
the
firing
was
still
proceeding
when
of
ficers
generals
and
gentlemeninwaiting
came
running
out
of
the
cathedral
and
after
them
others
in
a
more
leisurely
manner
caps
were
again
raised
and
those
who
had
run
to
look
at
the
cannon
ran
back
again
.
at
last
four
men
in
uniforms
and
sashes
emerged
from
the
cathe
dral
doors
.
hurrah
hurrah
shouted
the
crowd
again
.
which
is
he
which
asked
ptya
in
a
tearful
voice
of
those
around
him
but
no
one
answered
him
everybody
was
too
excited
and
pdtya
fixing
on
one
of
those
four
men
whom
he
could
not
clearly
see
for
the
tears
of
joy
that
filled
his
eyes
concentrated
all
his
enthusiasm
on
him
though
it
happened
not
to
be
the
em
perorfrantically
shouted
hurrah
and
re
solved
that
tomorrow
come
what
might
he
would
join
the
army
.
the
crowd
ran
after
the
emperor
followed
him
to
the
palace
and
began
to
disperse
.
it
was
already
late
and
ptya
had
not
eaten
any
thing
and
was
drenched
with
perspiration
yet
he
did
not
go
home
but
stood
with
that
dimin
ishing
but
still
considerable
crowd
before
the
palace
while
the
emperor
dined
looking
in
at
the
palace
windows
expecting
he
knew
not
war
and
peace
what

.and
envying
alike
the
notables
he
saw
arriving
at
the
entrance
to
dine
with
the
em
peror
and
the
court
footmen
who
served
at
table
glimpses
of
whom
could
be
seen
through
the
windows
.
while
the
emperor
was
dining
valuev
look
ing
out
of
the
window
said
the
people
are
still
hoping
to
see
your
majesty
again
.
the
dinner
was
nearly
over
and
the
emper
or
munching
a
biscuit
rose
and
went
out
onto
the
balcony
.
the
people
with
petya
among
them
rushed
toward
the
balcony
.

cried
the
crowd
and
ptya
with
it
and
again
the
women
and
men
of
weaker
mold
pdtya
among
them
wept
with
joy
.
a
largish
piece
of
the
biscuit
the
emperor
was
holding
in
his
hand
broke
off
fell
on
the
balcony
parapet
and
then
to
the
ground
.
a
coachman
in
a
jerkin
who
stood
nearest
sprang
forward
and
snatched
it
up
.
several
people
in
the
crowd
rushed
at
the
coachman
.
seeing
this
the
emperor
had
a
plateful
of
biscuits
brought
him
and
began
throwing
them
down
from
the
balcony
.
ptyas
eyes
grew
bloodshot
and
still
more
excited
by
the
danger
of
being
crushed
he
rushed
at
the
biscuits
.
he
did
not
know
why
but
he
had
to
have
a
biscuit
from
the
tsars
hand
and
he
felt
that
he
must
not
give
way
.
he
sprang
forward
and
upset
an
old
woman
who
was
catching
at
a
biscuit
the
old
woman
did
not
consider
herself
defeated
though
she
was
lying
on
the
ground
she
grabbed
at
some
biscuits
but
her
hand
did
not
reach
them
.
petya
pushed
her
hand
away
with
his
knee
seized
a
biscuit
and
as
if
fearing
to
be
too
late
again
shouted
hurrah
with
a
voice
already
hoarse
.
the
emperor
went
in
and
after
that
the
greater
part
of
the
crowd
began
to
disperse
.
there
i
i
said
if
only
we
waited
and
so
it
was
was
being
joyfully
said
by
various
peo
pie
.
happy
as
ptya
was
he
felt
sad
at
having
to
go
home
knowing
that
all
the
enjoyment
of
that
day
was
over
.
he
did
not
go
straight
home
from
the
kremlin
but
called
on
his
friend
obolnski
who
was
fifteen
and
was
also
enter
ing
the
regiment
.
on
returning
home
ptya
announced
resolutely
and
firmly
that
if
he
was
not
allowed
to
enter
the
service
he
would
run
away
.
and
next
day
count
ilyd
rost6v
though
he
had
not
yet
quite
yielded
went
to
inquire
how
he
could
arrange
for
ptya
to
serve
where
there
would
be
least
danger
.
chapter
xxii
two
days
later
on
the
fifteenth
of
july
an
immense
number
of
carriages
were
standing
outside
the
slob6da
palace
.
the
great
halls
were
full
.
in
the
first
were
the
nobility
and
gentry
in
their
uniforms
in
the
second
bearded
merchants
in
fullskirted
coats
of
blue
cloth
and
wearing
medals
.
in
the
noblemens
hall
there
was
an
incessant
move
ment
and
buzz
of
voices
.
the
chief
magnates
sat
on
highbacked
chairs
at
a
large
table
under
the
portrait
of
the
emperor
but
most
of
the
gentry
were
strolling
about
the
room
.
all
these
nobles
whom
pierre
met
every
day
at
the
club
or
in
their
own
houses
were
in
uni
form
some
in
that
of
catherines
day
others
in
that
of
the
emperor
paul
others
again
in
the
new
uniforms
of
alexanders
time
or
the
ordinary
uniform
of
the
nobility
and
the
gen
eral
characteristic
of
being
in
uniform
imparted
something
strange
and
fantastic
to
these
di
verse
and
familiar
personalities
both
old
and
young
.
the
old
men
dimeyed
toothless
bald
sallow
and
bloated
or
gaunt
and
wrinkled
were
especially
striking
.
for
the
most
part
they
sat
quietly
in
their
places
and
were
silent
or
if
they
walked
about
and
talked
attached
them
selves
to
someone
younger
.
on
all
these
faces
as
on
the
faces
of
the
crowd
petya
had
seen
in
the
square
there
was
a
striking
contradiction
the
general
expectation
of
a
solemn
event
and
at
the
same
time
the
everyday
interests
in
a
boston
card
party
peter
the
cookzinafdadmi
trievnas
health
and
so
on
.
pierre
was
there
too
buttoned
up
since
early
morning
in
a
noblemans
uniform
that
had
be
come
too
tight
for
him
.
he
was
agitated
this
extraordinary
gathering
not
only
of
nobles
but
also
of
the
merchantclass
les
dtats
gdntraux
statesgeneral
evoked
in
him
a
whole
series
of
ideas
he
had
long
laid
aside
but
which
were
deeply
graven
in
his
soul
thoughts
of
the
con
trat
social
and
the
french
revolution
.
the
words
that
had
struck
him
in
the
emperors
appeal
that
the
sovereign
was
coming
to
the
capital
for
consultation
with
his
people
strengthened
this
idea
.
and
imagining
that
in
this
direction
something
important
which
he
had
long
awaited
was
drawing
near
he
strolled
about
watching
and
listening
to
conversations
but
nowhere
finding
any
confirmation
of
the
ideas
that
occupied
him
.
the
emperors
manifesto
was
read
evoking
enthusiasm
and
then
all
moved
about
discus
sing
it
.
besides
the
ordinary
topics
of
conver
sation
pierre
heard
questions
of
where
the
book
marshals
of
the
nobility
were
to
stand
when
the
emperor
entered
when
a
ball
should
be
given
in
the
emperors
honor
whether
they
should
group
themselves
by
districts
or
by
whole
provinces

.

.

.
and
so
on
but
as
soon
as
the
war
was
touched
on
or
what
the
nobility
had
been
convened
for
the
talk
became
unde
cided
and
indefinite
.
then
all
preferred
listen
ing
to
speaking
.
a
middleaged
man
handsome
and
virile
in
the
uniform
of
a
retired
naval
officer
was
speak
ing
in
one
of
the
rooms
and
a
small
crowd
was
pressing
round
him
.
pierre
went
up
to
the
cir
cle
that
had
formed
round
the
speaker
and
lis
tened
.
count
ilyd
rost6v
in
a
military
uni
form
of
catherines
time
was
sauntering
with
a
pleasant
smile
among
the
crowd
with
all
of
whom
he
was
acquainted
.
he
too
approached
that
group
and
listened
with
a
kindly
smile
and
nods
of
approval
as
he
always
did
to
what
the
speaker
was
saying
.
the
retired
naval
man
was
speaking
very
boldly
as
was
evident
from
the
expression
on
the
faces
of
the
listeners
and
from
the
fact
that
some
people
pierre
knew
as
the
meekest
and
quietest
of
men
walked
away
disapprovingly
or
expressed
disagreement
with
him
.
pierre
pushed
his
way
into
the
middle
of
the
group
listened
and
convinced
himself
that
the
man
was
indeed
a
liberal
but
of
views
quite
different
from
his
own
.
the
naval
officer
spoke
in
a
particularly
sonorous
musical
and
aristocratic
baritone
voice
pleasantly
swallow
ing
his
rs
and
generally
slurring

count

mouth
watered
with
pleasure
and
he
nudged

but
pierre
wanted
to
speak
himself
.
he
pushed
forward
feeling
stirred
but
not
yet
sure
what
stirred
him
or
what
he
would
say
.
scarcely
had
he
opened
his
mouth
when
one
of
the
senators
a
man
with
out
a
tooth
in
his
head
with
a
shrewd
though
angry
expression
standing
near
the
first
speak
er
interrupted
him
.
evidently
accustomed
to
managing
debates
and
to
maintaining
an
ar
gument
he
began
in
low
but
distinct
tones
i
imagine
sir
said
he
mumbling
with
his
toothless
mouth
that
we
have
been
summoned
here
not
to
discuss
whether
its
best
for
the
em
pire
at
the
present
moment
to
adopt
conscrip
tion
or
to
call
out
the
militia
.
we
have
been
summoned
to
reply
to
the
appeal
with
which
our
sovereign
the
emperor
has
honored
us
.
but
to
judge
what
is
best
conscription
or
the
militia
we
can
leave
to
the
supreme
authori
ty
.

.

.

.
pierre
suddenly
saw
an
outlet
for
his
excite
ment
.
he
hardened
his
heart
against
the
sena
tor
who
was
introducing
this
set
and
narrow
attitude
into
the
deliberations
of
the
nobility
.
pierre
stepped
forward
and
interrupted
him
.
he
himself
did
not
yet
know
what
he
would
say
but
he
began
to
speak
eagerly
occasional
ly
lapsing
into
french
or
expressing
himself
in
bookish
russian
.
excuse
me
your
excellency
he
began
.
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
senator
but
thought
it
necessary
on
this
occasion
to
ad
dress
him
formally
.
though
i
dont
agree
with
the
gentleman

.

.

.
he
hesitated
he
wished
to
say
mon
ires
honorable
propin
antmy
very
honorable
opponent
with
the
gentleman

.

.

.
whom
i
have
not
the
honor
of
knowing
i
suppose
that
the
nobility
have
been
summoned
not
merely
to
express
their
sympathy
and
enthusiasm
but
also
to
consider
the
means
by
which
we
can
assist
our
father
land
i
imagine
he
went
on
warming
to
his
subject
that
the
emperor
himself
would
not
be
satisfied
to
find
in
us
merely
owners
of
serfs
whom
we
are
willing
to
devote
to
his
service
and
chair
a
canon
we
are
ready
to
make
of
ourselves
and
not
to
obtain
from
us
any
co
cocounsel
.
many
persons
withdrew
from
the
circle
no
ticing
the
senators
sarcastic
smile
and
the
free
dom
of
pierres
remarks
.
only

386
was
pleased
with
them
as
he
had
been
pleased
with
those
of
the
naval
officer
the
senator
and
in
general
with
whatever
speech
he
had
last
heard
.
i
think
that
before
discussing
these
ques
tions
pierre
continued
we
should
ask
the
emperor
most
respectfully
ask
his
majesty
to
let
us
know
the
number
of
our
troops
and
the
position
in
which
our
army
and
our
forces
now
are
and
then

.

.

.
but
scarcely
had
pierre
uttered
these
words
before
he
was
attacked
from
three
sides
.
the
most
vigorous
attack
came
from
an
old
ac
quaintance
a
boston
player
who
had
always
been
well
disposed
toward
him

in

whether
as
a
result
of
the
uniform
or
from
some
other
cause
pierre
saw
before
him
quite
a
different
man
.
with
a
sudden
expression
of
malevolence
on
his
aged
face
adrdksin
shouted
at
pierre
in
the
first
place
i
tell
you
we
have
no
right
to
question
the
emperor
about
that
and
sec
ondly
if
the
russian
nobility
had
that
right
the
emperor
could
not
answer
such
a
question
.
the
troops
are
moved
according
to
the
enemys
movements
and
the
number
of
men
increases
and
decreases

another
voice
that
of
a
nobleman
of
medi
um
height
and
about
forty
years
of
age
whom
pierre
had
formerly
met
at
the
gypsies
and
knew
as
a
bad
cardplayer
and
who
also
trans
formed
by
his
uniform
came
up
to
pierre
in
terrupted
adrdksin
.
yes
and
this
is
not
a
time
for
discussing
he
continued
but
for
acting
there
is
war
in
russia
the
enemy
is
advancing
to
destroy
russia
to
desecrate
the
tombs
of
our
fathers
to
carry
off
our
wives
and
children
.
the
no
bleman
smote
his
breast
.
we
will
all
arise
every
one
of
us
will
go
for
our
father
the
tsar
he
shouted
rolling
his
bloodshot
eyes
.
several
approving
voices
were
heard
in
the
crowd
.
we
are
russians
and
will
not
grudge
our
blood
in
defense
of
our
faith
the
throne
and
the
fatherland
we
must
cease
raving
if
we
are
sons
of
our
fatherland
we
will
show
europe
how
russia
rises
to
the
defense
of
rus
sia
pierre
wished
to
reply
but
could
not
get
in
a
word
.
he
felt
that
his
words
apart
from
what
meaning
they
conveyed
were
less
audible
than
the
sound
of
his
opponents
voice
.
count
rost6v
at
the
back
of
the
crowd
was
expressing
approval
several
persons
briskly
war
and
peace
turning
a
shoulder
to
the
orator
at
the
end
of
a
phrase
said
thats
right
quite
right
just
so
pierre
wished
to
say
that
he
was
ready
to
sacrifice
his
money
his
serfs
or
himself
only
one
ought
to
know
the
state
of
affairs
in
order
to
be
able
to
improve
it
but
he
was
unable
to
speak
.
many
voices
shouted
and
talked
at
the
same
time
so
that
count
rost6v
had
not
time
to
signify
his
approval
of
them
all
and
the
group
increased
dispersed
reformed
and
then
moved
with
a
hum
of
talk
into
the
largest
hall
and
to
the
big
table
.
not
only
was
pierres
at
tempt
to
speak
unsuccessful
but
he
was
rude
ly
interrupted
pushed
aside
and
people
turned
away
from
him
as
from
a
common
enemy
.
this
happened
not
because
they
were
displeased
by
the
substance
of
his
speech
which
had
even
been
forgotten
after
the
many
subsequent
speeches
but
to
animate
it
the
crowd
needed
a
tangible
object
to
love
and
a
tangible
object
to
hate
.
pierre
became
the
latter
.
many
other
orators
spoke
after
the
excited
nobleman
and
all
in
the
same
tone
.
many
spoke
eloquently
and
with
originality
.
glinka
the
editor
of
the
russian
messenger
who
was
recognized
cries
of
author
author
were
heard
in
the
crowd
said
that
hell
must
be
repulsed
by
hell
and
that
he
had
seen
a
child
smiling
at
lightning
flashes
and
thunder
claps
but
we
will
not
be
that
child
.
yes
yes
at
thunderclaps
was
repeated
approvingly
in
the
back
rows
of
the
crowd
.
the
crowd
drew
up
to
the
large
table
at
which
sat
grayhaired
or
bald
seventyyearold
magnates
uniformed
and
besashed
almost
all
of
whom
pierre
had
seen
in
their
own
homes
with
their
buffoons
or
playing
boston
at
the
clubs
.
with
an
incessant
hum
of
voices
the
crowd
advanced
to
the
table
.
pressed
by
the
throng
against
the
high
backs
of
the
chairs
the
orators
spoke
one
after
another
and
sometimes
two
together
.
those
standing
behind
noticed
what
a
speaker
omitted
to
say
and
hastened
to
supply
it
.
others
in
that
heat
and
crush
racked
their
brains
to
find
some
thought
and
hastened
to
utter
it
.
the
old
magnates
whom
pierre
knew
sat
and
turned
to
look
first
at
one
and
then
at
another
and
their
faces
for
the
most
part
only
expressed
the
fact
that
they
found
it
very
hot
.
pierre
however
felt
excited
and
the
general
desire
to
show
that
they
were
ready
to
go
to
all
lengthswhich
found
expression
in
the
tones
and
looks
more
than
in
the
substance
of
the
speeches
infected
him
too
.
he
did
not
book
renounce
his
opinions
but
felt
himself
in
some
way
to
blame
and
wished
to
justify
him
self
.
i
only
said
that
it
would
be
more
to
the
purpose
to
make
sacrifices
when
we
know
what
is
needed
said
he
trying
to
be
heard
above
the
other
voices
.
one
of
the
old
men
nearest
to
him
looked
round
but
his
attention
was
immediately
di
verted
by
an
exclamation
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
.
yes
moscow
will
be
surrenderedl
she
will
be
our
expiation
shouted
one
man
.
he
is
the
enemy
of
mankind
cried
anoth
er
.
allow
me
to
speak

you
are
crushing

at
that
moment
count

with
his
protruding
chin
and
alert
eyes
wearing
the
uniform
of
a
general
with

over
his
shoul

entered
the
room
stepping
briskly
to
the
front
of
the
crowd
of
gentry

our
sovereign

will
be
here
in
a
moment
said
rostopchfn
.
i
am
straight
from

seeing
the
position
we
are
in
i
think
there
is
little
need
for
discussion

the

has
deigned
to
summon
us
and
the
merchants
.
millions
will
pour
forth
from
there
he
pointed
to

but
our
business
is
to
supply

and
not
spare
ourselves
.

.
that
is
the
least
we
can
do
a
conference
took
place
confined
to
the
magnates
sitting
at
the
table

the
whole
con
sultation
passed
more
than
quietly

after
all
the
preceding
noise
the
sound
of
their
old
voices
saying
one
after
another
i
agree
or
for
variety
i
too
am
of
that
opinion
and
so
on
had
even
a
mournful
effect
.
the
secretary
was
told
to
write
down
the
resolution
of
the
moscow
nobility
and
gentry
that
they
would
furnish
ten
men
fully
equipped
out
of
every
thousand
serfs
as
the
smolensk
gentry
had
done
.
their
chairs
made
a
scraping
noise
as
the
gentlemen
who
had
conferred
rose
with
apparent
relief
and
began
walking
up
and
d6wn
arm
in
arm
to
stretch
their
legs
and
converse
in
couples
.
the
emperor
the

a
sudden
cry
resounded
through
the
halls
and
the
whole
throng
hurried
to
the
entrance
.
the
emperor
entered
the
hall
through
a
broad
path
between
two
lines
of
nobles
.
every
face
expressed
respectful
awestruck
curiosity

stood
rather
far
off
and
could
not
hear
all
that
the
emperor
said
.
from
what
he
did
hear
he
understood
that
the
emperor
spoke
of
the
danger
threatening
the
empire
and
of
the
hopes
he
placed
on
the
moscow
nobility
.
he
was
answered
by
a
voice
which
informed
him
of
the
resolution
just
arrived
at
.

said
the
emperof
with
aquiv
ering
voice
.
there
was
a
rustling
among
the
crowd
and
it
again
subsided
so
that
pierre
distinctly
heard
the
pleasantly
human
voice
of
the
emperor
saying
with
emotion
i
never
doubted
the
devotion
of
the
rus

the

pressing
round
him
and
rapturous
ex
clamations
were
heard
from
all
sides

at

and
though
he
had
heard
hardly
anything
un
derstood
everything
in
his
own
way
.
from
the
hall
of
the
nobility
the
emperor
went
to
that
of
the
merchants
.
there
he
re
mained
about
ten
minutes

among

who

as
became
known
later
he
had
scarcely
begun
to
address
the
merchants
before
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
and
he
concluded
in
a
trembling
voice
.
when
pierre
saw
the
emperor
he
was
coming
out
accompanied
by
two
merchants

of
whom

now
felt
ashamed
of

sought
an

of

the
innumerable
people
who
took
part
in

acted
in
accord

characteristics

stances
and
aims

that
they
knew
what
they

but
they
all
were
involuntary
tools
of
history
carrying
on
a
work
concealed
from
them
but
compre
hensible
to

such
is
the
inevitable
fate
of
men
of
action
and
the

they
stand
in
the
social
hierarchy
the
less
are

actors
of

have
long
since
left
the
stage
their
personal
interests
have
vanished
leaving
no
trace
anci
nothing
remains
of
that
time
but
its
historic
results
.
providence
compelled
all
these
men
striv
ing
to
attain
personal
aims
to
further
the
ac
complishment
of
a
stupendous
result
no
one
of
them
at
all
expected
neither
napoleon
nor
alexander
nor
still
less
any
of
those
who
did
the
actual
fighting
.
the
cause
of
the
destruction
of
the
french
army
in
1812
is
clear
to
us
now
.
no
one
will
deny
that
that
cause
was
on
the
one
hand
its
advance
into
the
heart
of
russia
late
in
the
season
without
any
preparation
for
a
winter
campaign
and
on
the
other
the
character
giv
en
to
the
war
by
the
burning
of
russian
towns
and
the
hatred
of
the
foe
this
aroused
among
the
russian
people
.
but
no
one
at
the
time
foresaw
what
now
seems
so
evident
that
this
was
the
only
way
an
army
of
eight
hundred
thousand
men
the
best
in
the
world
and
led
by
the
best
general
could
be
destroyed
in
con
flict
with
a
raw
army
of
half
its
numerical
strength
and
led
by
inexperienced
command
ers
as
the
russian
army
was
.
not
only
did
no
one
see
this
but
on
the
russian
side
every
ef
fort
was
made
to
hinder
the
only
thing
that
could
save
russia
while
on
the
french
side
despite
napoleons
experience
and
socalled
military
genius
every
effort
was
directed
to
pushing
on
to
moscow
at
the
end
of
the
sum
mer
that
is
to
doing
the
very
thing
that
was
bound
to
lead
to
destruction
.
in
historical
works
on
the
year
1812
french
writers
are
very
fond
of
saying
that
napoleon
felt
the
danger
of
extending
his
line
that
he
sought
a
battle
and
that
his
marshals
advised
him
to
stop
at
smolensk
and
of
making
similar
statements
to
show
that
the
danger
of
the
cam
paign
was
even
then
understood
.
russian
au
thors
are
still
fonder
of
telling
us
that
from
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
a
scythian
war
plan
was
adopted
to
lure
napoleon
into
the
depths
of
russia
and
this
plan
some
of
them
attribute
to
pfuel
others
to
a
certain
frenchman
others
to
toll
and
others
again
to
alexander
himself
pointing
to
notes
projects
and
letters
which
contain
hints
of
such
a
line
of
action
.
but
all
these
hints
at
what
happened
both
from
the
french
side
and
the
russian
are
advanced
only
because
they
fit
in
with
the
event
.
had
that
event
not
occurred
these
hints
would
have
been
forgotten
as
we
have
forgot
ten
the
thousands
and
millions
of
hints
and
expectations
to
the
contrary
which
were
cur
rent
then
but
have
now
been
forgotten
because
the
event
falsified
them
.
there
are
always
so
many
conjectures
as
to
the
issue
of
any
event
that
however
it
may
end
there
will
always
be
people
to
say
i
said
then
that
it
would
be
so
quite
forgetting
that
amid
their
innumerable
389
war
and
peace
conjectures
many
were
to
quite
the
contrary
effect
.
conjectures
as
to
napoleons
awareness
of
the
danger
of
extending
his
line
and
on
the
russian
side
as
to
luring
the
enemy
into
the
depths
of
russia
are
evidently
of
that
kind
and
only
by
much
straining
can
historians
at
tribute
such
conceptions
to
napoleon
and
his
marshals
or
such
plans
to
the
russian
com
manders
.
all
the
facts
are
in
flat
contradiction
to
such
conjectures
.
during
the
whole
period
of
the
war
not
only
was
there
no
wish
on
the
russian
side
to
draw
the
french
into
the
heart
of
the
country
but
from
their
first
entry
into
russia
everything
was
done
to
stop
them
.
and
not
only
was
napoleon
not
afraid
to
extend
his
line
but
he
welcomed
every
step
forward
as
a
triumph
and
did
not
seek
battle
as
eagerly
as
in
former
campaigns
but
very
lazily
.
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
war
our
armies
were
divided
and
our
sole
aim
was
to
unite
them
though
uniting
the
armies
was
no
ad
vantage
if
we
meant
to
retire
and
lure
the
en
emy
into
the
depths
of
the
country
.
our
em
peror
joined
the
army
to
encourage
it
to
de
fend
every
inch
of
russian
soil
and
not
to
re
treat
.
the
enormous
drissa
camp
was
formed
on
pfuels
plan
and
there
was
no
intention
of
retiring
farther
.
the
emperor
reproached
the
commanders
in
chief
for
every
step
they
re
tired
.
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
letting
the
enemy
even
reach
smolensk
still
less
could
he
contemplate
the
burning
of
moscow
and
when
our
armies
did
unite
he
was
displeased
that
smolensk
was
abandoned
and
burned
without
a
general
engagement
having
been
fought
under
its
walls
.
so
thought
the
emperor
and
the
russian
commanders
and
people
were
still
more
pro
voked
at
the
thought
that
our
forces
were
re
treating
into
the
depths
of
the
country
.
napoleon
having
cut
our
armies
apart
ad
vanced
far
into
the
country
and
missed
several
chances
of
forcing
an
engagement
.
in
august
he
was
at
smolensk
and
thought
only
of
how
to
advance
farther
though
as
we
now
see
that
ad
vance
was
evidently
ruinous
to
him
.
the
facts
clearly
show
that
napoleon
did
not
foresee
the
danger
of
the
advance
on
mos
cow
nor
did
alexander
and
the
russian
com
manders
then
think
of
luring
napoleon
on
but
quite
the
contrary
.
the
luring
of
napo
leon
into
the
depths
of
the
country
was
not
the
result
of
any
plan
for
no
one
believed
it
to
be
possible
it
resulted
from
a
most
complex
interplay
of
intrigues
aims
and
wishes
among
those
who
took
part
in
the
war
and
had
no
per
ception
whatever
of
the
inevitable
or
of
the
one
way
of
saving
russia
.
everything
came
about
fortuitously
.
the
armies
were
divided
at
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
.
we
tried
to
unite
them
with
the
evident
intention
of
giving
battle
and
checking
the
enemys
ad
vance
and
by
this
effort
to
unite
them
while
avoiding
battle
with
a
much
stronger
enemy
and
necessarily
withdrawing
the
armies
at
an
acute
angle
we
led
the
french
on
to
smolensk
.
but
we
withdrew
at
an
acute
angle
not
only
because
the
french
advanced
between
our
two
armies
the
angle
became
still
more
acute
and
we
withdrew
still
farther
because
barclay
de
tolly
was
an
unpopular
foreigner
disliked
by
bagrati6n
who
would
come
under
his
com
mand
and
bagrati6n
being
in
command
of
the
second
army
tried
to
postpone
joining
up
and
coming
under
barclays
command
as
long
as
he
could
.
bagration
was
slow
in
effecting
the
junction
though
that
was
the
chief
aim
of
all
at
headquarters
because
as
he
alleged
he
exposed
his
army
to
danger
on
this
march
and
it
was
best
for
him
to
retire
more
to
the
left
and
more
to
the
south
worrying
the
enemy
from
flank
and
rear
and
securing
from
the
ukraine
recruits
for
his
army
and
it
looks
as
if
he
planned
this
in
order
not
to
come
under
the
command
of
the
detested
foreigner
bar
clay
whose
rank
was
inferior
to
his
own
.
the
emperor
was
with
the
army
to
encour
age
it
but
his
presence
and
ignorance
of
what
steps
to
take
and
the
enormous
number
of
ad
visers
and
plans
destroyed
the
first
armys
en
ergy
and
it
retired
.
the
intention
was
to
make
a
stand
at
the
drissa
camp
but
paulucci
aiming
at
becom
ing
commander
in
chief
unexpectedly
em
ployed
his
energy
to
influence
alexander
and
pfuels
whole
plan
was

.abandoned
and
the
command
entrusted
to
barclay
.
but
as
barclay
did
not
inspire
confidence
his
power
was
lim
ited
.
the
armies
were
divided
there
was
no
unity
of
command
and
barclay
was
unpopu
lar
but
from
this
confusion
division
and
the
unpopularity
of
the
foreign
commander
in
chief
there
resulted
on
the
one
hand
indecision
and
the
avoidance
of
a
battle
which
we
could
not
have
refrained
from
had
the
armies
been
united
and
had
someone
else
instead
of
bar
clay
been
in
command
and
on
the
other
an
everincreasing
indignation
against
the
foreign
ers
and
an
increase
in
patriotic
zeal
.
at
last
the
emperor
left
the
army
and
as
the
most
convenient
and
indeed
the
only
pretext
book
ten
for
his
departure
it
was
decided
that
it
was
nec
essary
for
him
to
inspire
the
people
in
the
capitals
and
arouse
the
nation
in
general
to
a
patriotic
war
.
and
by
this
visit
of
the
emperor
to
moscow
the
strength
of
the
russian
army
was
trebled
.
he
left
in
order
not
to
obstruct
the
com
mander
in
chiefs
undivided
control
of
the
army
and
hoping
that
more
decisive
action
would
then
be
taken
but
the
command
of
the
armies
became
still
more
contused
and
enfee
bled
.
bennigsen
the
tsarevich
and
a
swarm
of
adjutants
general
remained
with
the
army
to
keep
the
commander
in
chief
under
obser
vation
and
arouse
his
energy
and
barclay
feeling
less
free
than
ever
under
the
observa
tion
of
all
these
eyes
of
the
emperor
be
came
still
more
cautious
of
undertaking
any
decisive
action
and
avoided
giving
battle
.
barclay
stood
for
caution
.
the
tsarevich
hinted
at
treachery
and
demanded
a
general
engagement
.
lubomirski
bronnitski
wlocki
and
the
others
of
that
group
stirred
up
so
much
trouble
that
barclay
under
pretext
of
sending
papers
to
the
emperor
dispatched
these
polish
adjutants
general
to
petersburg
and
plunged
into
an
open
struggle
with
bennigsen
and
the
tsarevich
.
at
smolensk
the
armies
at
last
reunited
much
as
bagrati6n
disliked
it
.
bagrati6n
drove
up
in
a
carriage
to
the
house
occupied
by
barclay
.
barclay
donned
his
sash
and
came
out
to
meet
and
report
to
his
senior
officer
bagrati6n
.
despite
his
seniority
in
rank
bagrati6n
in
this
contest
of
magnanimity
took
his
orders
from
barclay
but
having
submitted
agreed
with
him
less
than
ever
.
by
the
emperors
or
ders
bagration
reported
direct
to
him
.
he
wrote
to
arakcheev
the
emperors
confidant
it
must
be
as
my
sovereign
pleases
but
i
can
not
work
with
the
minister
meaning
barclay
.
for
gods
sake
send
me
somewhere
else
if
only
in
command
of
a
regiment
.
i
cannot
stand
it
here
.
headquarters
are
so
full
of
germans
that
a
russian
cannot
exist
and
there
is
no
sense
in
anything
.
i
thought
i
was
really
serving
my
sov
ereign
and
the
fatherland
but
it
turns
out
that
i
am
serving
barclay
.
i
confess
i
do
not
want
to
.
the
swarm
of
bronnftskis
and
wintzinge
rodes
and
their
like
still
further
embittered
the
relations
between
the
commanders
in
chief
and
even
less
unity
resulted
.
preparations
were
made
to
fight
th
frencn
before
smolensk
.
a
general
was
sent
to
survey
the
position
.
this
general
hating
barclay
rode
to
visit
a
friend
of
his
own
a
corps
commander
and
having
spent
the
day
with
him
returned
to
barclay
and
condemned
as
unsuitable
from
every
point
of
view
the
battleground
he
had
not
seen
.
while
disputes
and
intrigues
were
going
on
about
the
future
field
of
battle
and
while
we
were
looking
for
the
french
having
lost
touch
with
them
the
french
stumbled
upon
neve
rovskis
division
and
reached
the
walls
of
smo
tensk
.
it
was
necessary
to
fight
an
unexpected
bat
tle
at
smolensk
to
save
our
lines
of
communi
cation
.
the
battle
was
fought
and
thousands
were
killed
on
both
sides
.
smolensk
was
abandoned
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
the
emperor
and
of
the
whole
peo
ple
.
but
smol6nsk
was
burned
by
its
own
in
habitants
who
had
been
misled
by
their
gov
.
ernor
.
and
these
ruined
inhabitants
setting
an
example
to
other
russians
went
to
moscow
thinking
only
of
their
own
losses
but
kindling
hatred
of
the
foe
.
napoleon
advanced
farther
and
we
retired
thus
arriving
at
the
very
result
which
caused
his
destruction
.
chapter
ii
the
day
after
his
son
had
left
prince
nicholas
sent
for
princess
mary
to
come
to
his
study
.

well
then
gloat

it
gloat
over
it
after
that
princess

did
not
see
her
fa
ther
for
a
whole
week
.
he
was
ill
and
did
not
leave
his
study
.
princess
mary
noticed
to
her
surprise
that
during
this
illness
the
old
prince
not
only
ex
cluded
her
from
his
room
but
did
not
admit
mademoiselle
bourienne
either
.
tikhon
alone
attended
him
.
at
the
end
of
the
week
the
prince
reappeared
and
resumed
his
former
way
of
life
devoting
himself
with
special
activity
to
building
opera
tions
and
the
arrangement
of
the
gardens
and
completely
breaking
off
his
relations
with
mademoiselle
bourienne
.
his
looks
and
cold
tone
to
his
daughter
seemed
to
say
there
you
see
you
plotted
against
me
you
lied
to
prince
andrew
about
my
relations
with
that
frenchwoman
and
made
me
quarrel
with
him
but
you
see
i
need
neither
her
nor

spent
half
of
every

with

and
peace
him
russian
and
music
herself
and
talking
to
dessalles
the
rest
of
the
day
she
spent
over
her
books
with
her
old
nurse
or
with
gods
folk
who
sometimes
came
by
the
back
door
to
see
her
.
of
the
war
princess
mary
thought
as
women
do
think
about
wars
.
she
feared
for
her
brother
who
was
in
it
was
horrified
by
and
amazed
at
the
strange
cruelty
that
impels
men
to
kill
one
another
but
she
did
not
understand
the
signif
icance
of
this
war
which
seemed
to
her
like
all
previous
wars
.
she
did
not
realize
the
signifi
cance
of
this
war
though
dessalles
with
whom
she
constantly
conversed
was
passionately
in
terestej
in
its
progress
and
tried
to
explain
his
own
conception
of
it
to
her
and
though
the
gods
folk
who
came
to
see
her
reported
in
their
own
way
the
rumors
current
among
the
people
of
an
invasion
by
antichrist
and
though
julie
now
princess
drubetskdya
who
had
re
sumed
correspondence
with
her
wrote
patri
otic
letters
from
moscow
.
i
write
you
in
russian
my
good
friend
wrote
julie
in
her
frenchified
russian
be
cause
i
have
a
detestation
for
all
the
french
and
the
same
for
their
language
which
i
can
not
support
to
hear
spoken
we
in
moscow
are
elated
by
enthusiasm
for
our
adored
em
peror
.
my
poor
husband
is
enduring
pains
and
hunger
in
jewish
taverns
but
the
news
which
i
have
inspires
me
yet
more
.
you
heard
probably
of
the
heroic
exploit
of
rae
vski
embracing
his
two
sons
and
saying
i
will
perish
with
them
but
we
will
not
be
shaken
and
truly
though
the
enemy
was
twice
stronger
than
we
we
were
unshakable
.
we
pass
the
time
as
we
can
but
in
war
as
in
war
the
princesses
aline
and
sophie
sit
whole
days
with
me
and
we
unhappy
widows
of
live
men
make
beautiful
conversations
over
our
char
pie
only
you
my
friend
are
missing

..
.
and
so
on
.
the
chief
reason
princess
mary
did
not
re
alize
the
full
significance
of
this
war
was
that
the
old
prince
never
spoke
of
it
did
not
recog
nize
it
and
laughed
at
dessalles
when
he
men
tioned
it
at
dinner
.
the
princes
tone
was
so
calm
and
confident
that
princess
mary
un
hesitatingly
believed
him
.
all
that
july
the
old
prince
was
exceedingly
active
and
even
animated
.
he
planned
anoth
er
garden
and
began
a
new
building
for
the
domestic
serfs
.
the
only
thing
that
made
prin
cess
mary
anxious
about
him
was
that
he
slept
very
little
and
instead
of
sleeping
in
his
study
as
usual
changed
his
sleeping
place
every
day
.
one
day
he
would
order
his
camp
bed
to
be
set
up
in
the
glass
gallery
another
day
he
re
mained
on
the
couch
or
on
the
lounge
chair
in
the
drawing
room
and
dozed
there
without
un
dressing
while
instead
of
mademoiselle
bou
rienne
a
serf
boy
read
to
him
.
then
again
he
would
spend
a
night
in
the
dining
room
.
on
august
i
a
second
letter
was
received
from
prince
andrew
.
in
his
first
letter
which
came
soon
after
he
had
left
home
prince
an
drew
had
dutifully
asked
his
fathers
forgive
ness
for
what
he
had
allowed
himself
to
say
and
begged
to
be
restored
to
his
favor
.
to
this
letter
the
old
prince
had
replied
affectionately
and
from
that
time
had
kept
the
frenchwom
an
at
a
distance
.
prince

a
plan
he
had
drawn
and
forecasts
as
to
the
further
prog
ress
of
the
war
.
in
this
letter
prince
andrew
pointed
out
to
his
father
the
danger
of
staying
at
bald
hills
so
near
the
theater
of
war
and
on
the
armys
direct

of

and
advised
him
to
move
to
moscow
.
at
dinner
that
day
on
dessalles

ing
that
the
french
were
said
to
have
already
entered

the
old
prince
remembered
his

there
was
a
letter
from
prince
andrew
to
day
he
said
to
princess

she
replied
in
a
frightened
voice
.
she
could
not
have
read
the
letter
as
she
did
not
even
know
it
had
arrived
.

the
prince
with
the
ironic
smile
that

become
habitual
to
him
in
speaking
of

present
war

but
as

the

returned
with
quick

accompanied
by
michael

bringing
the

and
a
plan
.
these
he
put
down
beside

anyone

them
at

.
on
moving
to
the
drawing
room
he
handed
the
letter
to
princess

and
spreading
out
before
him
the
plan
of
the
new
building
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
it
told
her
to

dessalles
looked
in
amazement
at
the
prince
who
was
talking
of
the
niemen
when
the
en
emy
was
already
at
the
dnieper
but
princess

forgetting
the
geographical

of

thought
that

the

continued
evidently
thinking
of
the
campaign
of
1807
which
seemed
to
him
so
recent

suddenly
went
on
raising
his
head
and
pointing
to
the
plan
of
the
building
tell
me
how
you
mean
to
alter
it
.

.

.

.
michael
ivdnovich
went
up
to
the
plan
and
the
prince
after
speaking
to
him
about
the
new
building
looked
angrily
at
princess
mary
and
dessalles
and
went
to
his
own
room
.
princess
mary
saw
dessalles
embarrassed
and
astonished
look
fixed
on
her
father
no
ticed
his
silence
and
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
her
father
had
forgotten
his
sons
letter
on
the
drawingroom
table
but
she
was
not
only
afraid
to
speak
of
it
and
ask
dessalles
the
rea
son
of
his
confusion
and
silence
but
was
afraid
even
to
think
about
it
.
in
the
evening
michael
ivdnovich
sent
by
the
ptince
came
to
princess
mary
for
prince
andrews
letter
which
had
been
forgotten
in
the
drawing
room
.
she
gave
it
to
him
and
un
pleasant
as
it
was
to
her
to
do
so
ventured
to
ask
him
what
her
father
was
doing
.
always
busy
replied
michael
ivdnovich
with
a
respectfully
ironic
smile
which
caused
princess
mary
to
turn
pale
.
hes
worrying
very
much
about
the
new
building
.
he
has
been
reading
a
little
but
now
michael
ivan
ovich
went
on
lowering
his
voice
now
hes
at
his
desk
busy
with
his
will
i
expect
.
one
of
the
princes
favorite
occupations
of
late
had
been
the
preparation
of
some
papers
he
meant
to
leave
at
his
death
and
which
he
called
his
will
.
and
alpdtych

asked
princess

.
oh
yes

time
.
chapter
iii
when
michael
ivanovich
returned
to
the
study
with
the
letter
the
old
prince
with
spec
tacles
on
and
a
shade
over
his
eyes
was
sitting
at
his
open
bureau
with
screened
candles
hold
ing
a
paper
in
his
outstretched
hand
and
in
a
somewhat
dramatic
attitude
was
reading
his
manuscript
his
remarks
as
he
termed
it
which
was
to
be
transmitted
to
the
emperor
after
his
death
.
when
michael
ivdnovich
went
in
there
were
tears
in
the
princes
eyes
evoked
by
the
memo
ry
of
the
time
when
the
paper
he
was
now
read
ing
had
been
written
.
he
took
the
letter
from
michael
ivdnovichs
hand
put
it
in
his
pocket
folded
up
his
papers
and
called
in
alpdtych
who
had
long
been
waiting
.
the
prince
had
a
list
of
things
to
be
bought
in
smolensk
and
walking
up
and
down
the
room
past
alpdtych
who
stood
by
the
door
he
gave
his
instructions
.

it
must

.
varnish
sealing
wax
as
in
michael
ivdnovichs
list
.
he
paced
up
and
down
for
a
while
and
glanced
at
his
notes
.
then
hand
to
the
governor
in
person
a
let
ter
about
the
deed
.
next
bolts
for
the
doors
of
the
new
build
ing
were
wanted
and
had
to
be
of
a
special
shape
the
prince
had
himself
designed
and
a
leather
case
had
to
be
ordered
to
keep
the
will
in
.
the
instructions
to
alpdtych
took
over
two
hours
and
still
the
prince
did
not
let
him
go
.
he
sat
down
sank
into
thought
closed
his
eyes
and
dozed
off
.
alpdtych
made
a
slight
move
ment
.
well
go
go
if
anything
more
is
wanted
ill
send
after
you
.
alpdtych
went
out
.
the
prince
again
went
to
his
bureau
glanced
into
it
fingered
his
pa
pers
closed
the
bureau
again
and
sat
down
at
the
table
to
write
to
the
governor
.
it
was
already
late
when
he
rose
after
seal
ing
the
letter
.
he
wished
to
sleep
but
he
knew
he
would
not
be
able
to
and
that
most
depress
ing
thoughts
came
to
him
in
bed
.
so
he
called
tikhon
and
went
through
the
rooms
with
him
to
show
him
where
to
set
up
the
bed
for
that
night
.
he
went
about
looking
at
every
corner
.
every
place
seemed
unsatisfactory
but
worst
of
all
was
his
customary
couch
in
the
study
.
that
couch
was
dreadful
to
him
probably
be
cause
of
the
oppressive
thoughts
he
had
had
when
lying
there
.
it
was
unsatisfactory
every
where
but
the
corner
behind
the
piano
in
the
sitting
room
was
better
than
other
places
he
had
never
slept
there
yet
.
with
the
help
of
a
footman
tfkhon
brought
in
the
bedstead
and
began
putting
it
up
.
thats
not
right
thats
not
right
cried
the
prince
and
himself
pushed
it
a
few
inches
from
the
corner
and
then
closer
in
again
.
well
at
last
ive
finished
now
ill
rest
thought
the
prince
and
let
tikhon
undress
him
.
frowning
with
vexation
at
the
effort
neces
sary
to
divest
himself
of
his
coat
and
trousers
the
prince
undressed
sat
down
heavily
on
the
bed
and
appeared
to
be
meditating
as
he
looked
contemptuously
at
his
withered
yellow
legs
.
he
was
not
meditating
but
only
defer
ring
the
moment
of
making
the
effort
to
lift
those
legs
up
and
turn
over
on
the
bed
.
ugh
how
hard
it
is
oh
that
this
toil
might
end
and
you
would
release
me
thought
he
.
pressing
his
lips
together
he
made
that
effort
for
the
twenty
thousandth
time
and
lay
down
.
but
hardly
had
he
done
so
before
he
felt
the
bed
rocking
backwards
and
forwards
beneath
him
as
if
it
were
breathing
heavily
and
jolting
.
this
happened
to
him
almost
every
night
.
he
opened
his
eyes
as
they
were
closing
.
no
peace
damn
them
he
muttered
an
gry
he
knew
not
with
whom
.
ah
yes
there
was
something
else
important
very
important
that
i
was
keeping
till
i
should
be
in
bed
.
the
bolts
no
i
told
him
about
them
.
no
it
was
something

in
the
drawing
room
.

the
prince
slapped
his
hand
on
the
table
.
yes

an
drews
letter
princess
mary
read
it
.
dessalles
said
something
about
vitebsk
.
now
ill
read
it
.
he
had
the
letter
taken
from
his
pocket
and
the
table
on
which
stood
a
glass
of
lem
onade
and
a
spiral
wax
handle
moved
close
to
the
bed
and
putting
on
his
spectacles
he
began
reading
.
only
now
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
reading
it
by
the
faint
light
under
the
green
shade
did
he
grasp
its
meaning
for
a
moment
.
the
french
at
vitebsk
in
four
days
march
they
may
be
at
smolensk
perhaps
are
already
there
tikhon
tfkhon
jumped
up
.
no
no
i
dont
want
anything
he
shouted
.
he
put
the
letter
under
the
candlestick
and
closed
his
eyes
.
and
there
rose
before
him
the
danube
at
bright
noonday
reeds
the
russian
camp
and
himself
a
young
general
without
a
wrinkle
on
his
ruddy
face
vigorous
and
alert
entering
potemkins
gaily
colored
tent
and
a
burning
sense
of
jealousy
of
the
favorite
agi
tated
him
now
as
strongly
as
it
had
done
then
.
he
recalled
all
the
words
spoken
at
that
first
meeting
with
potemkin
.
and
he
saw
before
him
a
plump
rather
sallowfaced
short
stout
woman
the
empress
mother
with
her
smile
and
her
words
at
her
first
gracious
reception
of
him
and
then
that
same
face
on
the
catafalque
and
the
encounter
he
had
with
ztibov
over
her
coffin
about
his
right
to
kiss
her
hand
.
oh
quicker
quicker
to
get
back
to
that
time
and
have
done
with
all
the
present
quick
er
quicker
and
that

bolk6nskis
es
tate
lay
forty
miles
east
from
smolensk
and
two
miles
from
the
main
road
to
moscow
.
the
same
evening
that
the
prince
gave
his
instructions
to
alpatych
dessalles
having
asked
to
see
princess
mary
told
her
that
as
the
prince
was
not
very
well
and
was
taking
no
steps
to
secure
his
safety
though
from
prince
an
drews
letter
it
was
evident
that
to
remain
at
bald
hills
might
be
dangerous
he
respectfully
advised
her
to
send
a
letter
by
alpatych
to
the
provincial
governor
at
smolensk
asking
him

.
to
let
her
know
the
state
of
affairs
and
the
ex
tent
of
the
danger
to
which
bald
hills
was
ex
posed
.
dessalles
wrote
this
letter
to
the
gover
nor
for
princess
mary
she
signed
it
and
it
was
given
to
alpatych
with
instructions
to
hand
it
to
the
governor
and
to
come
back
as
quickly
as
possible
if
there
was
danger
.
having
received
all
his
orders
alpdtych
wear
ing
a
white
beaver
hat
a
present
from
the
prince
and
carrying
a
stick
as
the
prince
did
went
out
accompanied
by
his
family
.
three
wellfed
roans
stood
ready
harnessed
to
a
small
conveyance
with
a
leather
hood
.
the
larger
bell
was
muffled
and
the
little
bells
on
the
harness
stuffed
with
paper
.
the
prince
allowed
no
one
at
bald
hills
to
drivewith
ring
ing
bells
but
on
a
long
journey
alpatych
liked
to
have
them
.
his
satellites
the
senior
clerk
a
countinghouse
clerk
a
scullery
maid
a
cook
two
old
women
a
little
pageboy
the
coachman
and
various
domestic
serfs
were
seeing
him
off
.
his
daughter
placed
chintzcovered
down
cushions
for
him
to
sit
on
and
behind
his
back
.
his
old
sisterinlaw
popped
in
a
small
bundle
and
one
of
the
coachmen
helped
him
into
the
vehicle
.
there
there
womens

women
women
said
alpatych
puffing
and
speaking
rapidly
just
as
the
prince
did
and
he
climbed
into
the
trap
.
after
giving
the
clerk
orders
about
the
work
to
be
done
alpatych
not
trying
to
imitate
the
prince
now
lifted
the
hat
from
his
bald
head
and
crossed
himself
three
times
.
if
there
is
anything

.

.

.
come
back
ydkov
alpdtych
for
christs
sake
think
of
us
cried
his
wife
referring
to
the
rumors
of
war
and
the
enemy
.
women
women
womens
fuss
muttered
alpdtych
to
himself
and
started
on
his
journey
looking
round
at
the
fields
of
yellow
rye
and
the
stillgreen
thickly
growing
oats
and
at
oth
ten
395
er
quite
black
fields
just
being
plowed
a
second
time
.
as
he
went
along
he
looked
with
pleasure
at
the
years
splendid
crop
of
corn
scrutinized
the
strips
of
ryefield
which
here
and
there
were
already
being
reaped
made
his
calculations
as
to
the
sowing
and
the
harvest
and
asked
him
self
whether
he
had
not
forgotten
any
of
the
princes
orders
.
having
baited
the
horses
twice
on
the
way
he
arrived
at
the
town
toward
evening
on
the
fourth
of
august
.
alpatych
kept
meeting
and
overtaking
bag
gage
trains
and
troops
on
the
road
.
as
he
ap
proached
smolensk
he
heard
the
sounds
of
dis
tant
firing
but
these
did
not
impress
him
.
what
struck
him
most
was
the
sight
of
a
splen
did
field
of
oats
in
which
a
camp
had
been
pitched
and
which
was
being
mown
down
by
the
soldiers
evidently
for
fodder
.
this
fact
impressed
alpdtych
but
in
thinking
about
his
own
business
he
soon
forgot
it
.
all
the
interests
of
his
life
for
more
than
thirty
years
had
been
bounded
by
the
will
of
the
prince
and
he
never
went
beyond
that
limit
.
everything
not
connected
with
the
exe
cution
of
the
princes
orders
did
not
interest
and
did
not
even
exist
for
alpdtych
.
on
reaching
smolensk
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
of
august
he
put
up
in
the
gdchina
suburb
across
the
dnieper
at
the
inn
kept
by
ferap6ntov
where
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
putting
up
for
the
last
thirty
years
.
some
thirty
years
ago
ferap6ntov
by
alpatychs
advice
had
bought
a
wood
from
the
prince
had
begun
to
trade
and
now
had
a
house
an
inn
and
a
corn
dealers
shop
in
that
province
.
he
was
a
stout
dark
redfaced
peasant
in
the
forties
with
thick
lips
a
broad
knob
of
a
nose
similar
knobs
over
his
black
frowning
brows
and
a
round
belly
.
wearing
a
waistcoat
over
his
cotton
shirt
ferap6ntov
was
standing
before
his
shop
which
opened
onto
the
street
.
on
seeing
alpatych
he
went
up
to
him
.
youre
welcome
ydkov
alpdtych
.
folks
are
leaving
the
town
but
you
have
come
to
it
said
he
.
why
are
they
leaving
the
town
asked
al
ptych
.
thats
what
i
say
.
folks
are
foolish
always
afraid
of
the
french
.
womens
fuss
womens
fuss
said
alpdtych
.
just
what
i
think
ydkov
alpdtych
.
what
i
say
is
orders
have
been
given
not
to
let
them
in
so
that
must
be
right
.
and
the
peasants
are
ask
396
war
and
peace
ing
three
rubles
for
carting
it
isnt
christian
yakov
alpdtych
heard
without
heeding
.
he
asked
for
a
samovar
and
for
hay
for
his
horses
and
when
he
had
had
his
tea
he
went
to
bed
.
all
night
long
troops
were
moving
past
the
inn
.
next
morning
alpdtych
donned
a
jacket
he
wore
only
in
town
and
went
out
on
business
.
it
was
a
sunny
morning
and
by
eight
oclock
it
was
already
hot
.
a
good
day
for
harvesting
thought
alpatych
.
from
beyond
the
town
firing
had
been
heard
since
earlymorning
.
at
eight
oclock
the
boom
ing
of
cannon
was
added
to
the
sound
of
mus
ketry
.
many
people
were
hurrying
through
the
streets
and
there
were
many
soldiers
but
cabs
were
still
driving
about
tradesmen
stood
at
their
shops
and
service
was
being
held
in
the
churches
as
usual
.
alpitych
went
to
the
shops
to
government
offices
to
the
post
office
and
to
the
governors
.
in
the
offices
and
shops
and
at
the
post
office
everyone
was
talking
about
the
army
and
about
the
enemy
who
was
already
at
tacking
the
town
everybody
was
asking
what
should
be
done
and
all
were
trying
to
calm
one
another
.
in
front
of
the
governors
house
alpitych
found
a
large
number
of
people
cossacks
and
a
traveling
carriage
of
the
governors
.
at
the
porch
he
met
two
of
the
landed
gentry
one
of
whom
he
knew
.
this
man
an
excaptain
of
police
was
saying
angrily
its
no
joke
you
know
its
all
very
well
if
youre
single
.
one
man
though

into

of
his
coat

he
always
did

repeated
and
descended
the
porch

.
alpatych
swayed
his
head
and
went
upstairs
.
in
the
waiting
room
were
tradesmen
women
and
officials
looking
silently
at
one
another
.
the
door
of
the
governors
room
opened
and
they
all
rose
and
moved
forward
.
an
official
ran
out
said
some
words
to
a
merchant
called
a
stout
official
with
a
cross
hanging
on
his
neck
to
follow
him
and
vanished
again
evidently
wishing
to
avoid
the
inquiring
looks
and
ques
tions
addressed
to
him
.
alpatych
moved
for
ward
and
next
time
the
official
came
out
ad
dressed
him
one
hand
placed
in
the
breast
of
his
buttoned
coat
and
handed
him
two
letters

to
his
honor

chief
prince
bolk6nski
he
announced
with
such
solemnity
and
significance
that
the
official
turned
to
him
and
took
the
letters
.
a
few
minutes
later
the
governor
received
alpatych
and
hurriedly
said
to
him
inform
the
prince
and
princess
that
i
knew
nothing
i
acted
on
the
highest
instructions

.
and
he
handed
a
paper
to
alpdtych

still
as

is
unwell
my
advice
is
that
they
should
go
to

but
the
governor
did
not
finish
a
dusty
per
spiring
officer
ran
into
the
room
and
began
to
say
something
in
french
.
the
governors
face
expressed
terror
.

he
said
nodding
his
head
to
alpdtych
and
began
questioning
the
officer
.
eager
frightened
helpless
glances
were
turned
on
alpdtych
when
he
came
out
of
the
governors
room
.
involuntarily
listening
now
to
the
firing
which
had
drawn
nearer
and
was
increasing
in
strength
alpdtych
hurried
to
his
inn
.
the
paper
handed
to
him
by
the
govern
or
said
this
i
assure
you
that
the
town
of
smolensk
is
not
in
the
slightest
danger
as
yet
and
it
is
unlikely
that
it
will
be
threatened
with
any
.
i
from
the
one
side
and
prince

from
the
other
are
marching
to
unite
our
forces

which
junction
will
be
effected

piled

emerging
from

moving
along

stood
at

were
wailing

as
they
said

a
small
watchdog
ran
round
barking
in

of
the
harnessed
horses
.
alpdtych
entered
the
innyard
at
a
quicker
pace
than
usual
and
went
straight
to
the
shed
where
his
horses
and

were
.
the

was
asleep

he
woke
him
up
told
him

went

from

the

of

the
hoarse
an

of

alpdtych
nodded
as

and
not
wishing
to

more
went
to
the
door
of
the

opposite
the
innkeepers

alpjitych
collected
his
parcels
handed
them
to
the
coachman
who
had
come
in
and
settled
up
with
the
innkeeper
.
the
noise
of
wheels
hoofs
and
bells
was
heard
from
the
gateway
as
a
little
trap
passed
out
.
it
was
by
now
late
in
the
afternoon
.
half
the
street
was
in
shadow
the
other
half
bright
ly
lit
by
the
sun
.
alpatych
looked
out
of
the
window
and
went
to
the
door
.
suddenly
the
strange
sound
of
a
faroff
whistling
and
thud
was
heard
followed
by
a
boom
of
cannon
blend
ing
into
a
dull
roar
that
set
the
windows
rat
tling
.
he
went
out
into
the
street
two
men
were
running
past
toward
the
bridge
.
from
different
sides
came
whistling
sounds
and
the
thud
of
cannon
balls
and
bursting
shells
falling
on
the
town
.
but
these
sounds
were
hardly
heard
in
comparison
with
the
noise
of
the
firing
outside
the
town
and
attracted
little
attention
from
the
inhabitants
.
the
town
was
being
bombard
ed
by
a
hundred
and
thirty
guns
which
napo
leon
had
ordered
up
after
four
oclock
.
the
people
did
not
at
once
realize
the
meaning
of
this
bombardment
.
at
first
the
noise
of
the
falling
bombs
and
shells
only
aroused
curiosity
.

and
with

to

in
silence
at
the
people

the
cook
and
a

came
to
the
gate

with
lively
curiosity
everyone
tried
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
projectiles

they
flew
over
their

shouted
to
the
cook

in
her

skirt
with
sleeves
rolled
up
swinging
her
bare
elbows
had
stepped
to
the
corner
to
listen
to
what

exclaimed

she
turned

in

exploded
and
the

.
scoundrel
what
are
you
doing
shouted
the
innkeeper
rushing
to
the
cook
.
at
that
moment
the
pitiful
wailing
of
wom
en
was
heard
from
different
sides
the
fright
ened
baby
began
to
cry
and
people
crowded
silently
with
pale
faces
round
the
cook
.
the
loudest
sound
in
that
crowd
was
her
wailing
.
ohhh
dear
souls
dear
kind
souls
dont
let
me
die
my
good
souls

.

.

.
five
minutes
later
no
one
remained
in
the
street
.
the
cook
with
her
thigh
broken
by
a
shell
splinter
had
been
carried
into
the
kitch
en
.
alpdtych
his
coachman
ferap6ntovs
wife
and
children
and
the
house
porter
were
all
sit
ting
in
the
cellar
listening
.
the
roar
of
guns
the
whistling
of
projectiles
and
the
piteous
moaning
of
the
cook
which
rose
above
the
oth
er
sounds
did
not
cease
fora
moment
.
the
mis
tress
rocked
and
hushed
her
baby
and
when
anyone
came
into
the
cellar
asked
in
a
pathetic
whisper
what
had
become
of
her
husband
who
had
remained
in
the
street
.
a
shopman
who
entered
told
her
that
her
husband
had
gone
with
others
to
the
cathedral
whence
they
were
fetching
the
wonderworking
icon
of
smolensk
.
toward
dusk
the
cannonade
began
to
sub
side
.
alpdtych
left
the
cellar
and
stopped
in
the
doorway
.
the
evening
sky
that
had
been
so
clear
was
clouded
with
smoke
through
which
high
up
the
sickle
of
the
new
moon
shone
strangely
.
now
that
the
terrible
din
of
the
guns
had
ceased
a
hush
seemed
to
reign
over
the
town
broken
only
by
the
rustle
of
footsteps
the
moaning
the
distant
cries
and
the
crackle
of
fires
which
seemed
widespread
everywhere
.
the
cooks
moans
had
now
subsided
.
on
two
sides
black
curling
clouds
of
smoke
rose
and
spread
from
the
fires
.
through
the
streets
sol
diers
in
various
uniforms
walked
or
ran
con
fusedly
in
different
directions
like
ants
from
a
ruined
anthill
.
several
of
them
ran
into
fera
pontovs
yard
before
alpdtychs
eyes
.
alpdtych
went
out
to
the
gate
.
a
retreating
regiment
thronging
and
hurrying
blocked
the
street
.
noticing
him
an
officer
said
the
town
is
being
abandoned
.
get
away
get
away
and
then
turning
to
the
soldiers
shouted
ill
teach
you
to
run
into
the
yards
alpdtych
went
back
to
the
house
called
the
coachman
and
told
him
to
set
off
.
ferap6ntovs
whole
household
came
out
too
following
al
pdtych
and
the
coachman
.
the
women
who
had
been
silent
till
then
suddenly
began
to
wail
as
they
looked
at
the
fires
the
smoke
and
even
the
flames
of
which
could
be
seen
in
the
failing
twilight
and
as
if
in
reply
the
same
kind
of
lamentation
was
heard
from
other
parts
of
the
street
.
inside
the
shed
alpdtych
and
the
coachman
arranged
the
tangled
reins
and
traces
of
their
horses
with
trembling
hands
.
as
alpdtych
was
driving
out
of
the
gate
he
saw
some
ten
soldiers
in
ferapontovs
open
shop
talking
loudly
and
filling
their
bags
and
knapsacks
with
flour
and
sunflower
seeds
.
just
then
ferapontov
returned
and
entered
his
shop
.
on
seeing
the
soldiers
he
was
about
to
shout
at
them
but
suddenly
stopped
and
clutching
at
his
hair
burst
into
sobs
and
laughter

he
cried
taking
some
bags
of

him
self
and
throwing
them
into
the
street
.
some
of
the
soldiers
were
frightened
and
ran
away

went
on
filling
their
bags

and
ferap6ntov
ran
into
the
yard
.
soldiers
were
passing
in
a
constant
stream
along
the
street
blocking
it
completely
so
that
alpdtych
could
not
pass
out
and
had
to
wait
.
ferap6ntovs
wife
and
children
were
also
sit
ting
in
a
cart
waiting
till
it
was
possible
to
drive
out
.
night
had
come
.
there
were
stars
in
the
sky
and
the
new
moon
shone
out
amid
the
smoke
that
screened
it
.
on
the
sloping
descent
to
the
dnieper
alpdtychs
cart
and
that
of
the

which
were
slowly
moving

of

in
a
side
street
near
the
crossroads
where
the
vehicles
had
stopped
a
house
ariti
some
shops
were
on
fire
.
this
fire
was
already
burning
itself
out
.
the
flames
now
died
down
and
were
lost
in
the
black
smoke
now
sudden
ly
flared
up
again
brightly
lighting
up
with
strange
distinctness
the
faces
of
the
people
crowding
at
the
crossroads
.
black
figures
flit
ted
about
before
the
fire
and
through
the
in
cessant
crackling
of
the
flames
talking
and
shouting
could
be
heard
.
seeing
that
his
trap
would
not
be
able
to
move
on
for
some
time
alpdtych
got
down
and
turned
into
the
side
street
to
look
at
the
fire
.
soldiers
were
contin
ually
rushing
backwards
and
forwards
near
it
and
he
saw
two
of
them
and
a
man
in
a
frieze
coat
dragging
burning
beams
in
to
another
yard
across
the
street
while
others
carried
bundles
of
hay
.
alpdtych
went
up
to
a
large
crowd
standing
before
a
high
barn
which
was
blazing
briskly
.
the
walls
were
all
on
fire
and
the
back
wall
had
fallen
in
the
wooden
roof
was
collapsing
and
the
rafters
were
alight
.
the
crowd
was
evident

of

prince

asked

prince
andrew
without

took

a
notebook
and
raising
his
knee
began
writing
in
pencil
on
a
page
he
tore
out

a

followed

galloped
up
to

.

something
cracked
in
the
flames
.
the
fire
died
down
for
a
moment
and
wreaths
of
black
smoke
rolled
from
under
the
roof
.
there
was
another
terrible
crash
and
something
huge

lapsed
.
ourourou
yelled
the
crowd
echoing
the
crash
of
the
collapsing
roof
of
the
barn
the
burning

in
which
diffused
a
cakelike
aroma
all
around

the
flames
flared
up

the
animated

faces
of

spectators

chapter
v
from
smolensk
the
troops
continued
to
re
treat
followed
by
the
enemy
.
on
the
tenth
of
august
the
regiment
prince
andrew
command
ed
was
marching
along
the
highroad
past
the
avenue
leading
to
bald
hills
.
heat
and
drought
had
continued
for
more
than
three
weeks
.
4x
each
day
fleecy
clouds
floated
across
the
sky
and
occasionally
veiled
the
sun
but
toward
evening
the
sky
cleared
again
and
the
sun
set
in
reddishbrown
mist
.
heavy
night
dews
alone
refreshed
the
earth
.
the
unreaped
corn
was
scorched
and
shed
its
grain
.
the
marshes
dried
up
.
the
cattle
lowed
from
hunger
finding
no
food
on
the
sunparched
meadows
.
only
at
night
and
in
the
forests
while
the
dew
lasted
was
there
any
freshness
.
but
on
the
road
the
highroad
along
which
the
troops
marched
there
was
no
such
freshness
even
at
night
or
when
the
road
passed
through
the
forest
the
dew
was
imperceptible
on
the
sandy
dust
churned
up
more
than
six
inches
deep
.
as
soon
as
day
dawned
the
march
began
.
the
artillery
and
baggage
wagons
moved
noiselessly
through
the
deep
dust
that
rose
to
the
very
hubs
of
the
wheels
and
the
infantry
sank
ankledeep
in
that
soft
choking
hot
dust
that
never
cooled
even
at
night
.
some
of
this
dust
was
kneaded
by
the
feet
and
wheels
while
the
rest
rose
and
hung
like
a
cloud
over
the
troops
settling
in
eyes
ears
hair
and
nostrils
and
worst
of
all
in
the
lungs
of
the
men
and
beasts
as
they
moved
along
that
road
.
the
higher
the
sun
rose
the
higher
rose
that
cloud
of
dust
and
through
the
screen
of
its
hot
fine
particles
one
could
look
with
naked
eye
at
the
sun
which
showed
like
a
huge
crimson
ball
in
the
unclouded
sky
.
there
was
no
wind
and
the
men
choked
in
that
motionless
atmosphere
.
they
marched
with
handkerchiefs
tied
over
their
noses
and
mouths
.
when
they
passed
through
a
village
they
all
rushed
to
the
wells
and
fought
for
the
water
and
drank
t
down
to
the
mud
.
prince
andrew
was
in
command
of
a
regi
ment
and
the
management
of
that
regiment
the
welfare
of
the
men
and
the
necessity
of
re
ceiving
and
giving
orders
engrossed
him
.
the
burning
of
smolensk
and
its
abandonment
made
an
epoch
in
his
life
.
a
novel
feeling
of
anger
against
the
foe
made
him
forget
his
own
sorrow
.
he
was
entirely
devoted
to
the
affairs
of
his
regiment
and
was
considerate
and
kind
to
his
men
and
officers
.
in
the
regiment
they
called
him
our
prince
were
proud
of
him
and
loved
him
.
but
he
was
kind
and
gentle
on
ly
to
those
of
his
regiment
to
tim6khin
and
the
like
people
quite
new
to
him
belonging
to
a
different
world
and
who
could
not
know
and
understand
his
past
.
as
soon
as
he
came
across
a
former
acquaintance
or
anyone
from
the
staff
he
bristled
up
immediately
and
grew
spiteful
ironical
and
contemptuous
.
every
thing
that
reminded
him
of
his
past
was
repug
war
and
peace
nant
to
him
and
so
in
his
relations
with
that
fdriner
circle
he
confined
himself
to
trying
to
do
his
duty
and
not
to
be
unfair
.
in
truth
everything
presented
itself
in
a
dark
and
gloomy
light
to
prince
andrew
especially
after
the
abandonment
of
smolensk
on
the
sixth
of
august
he
considered
that
it
could
and
should
have
been
defended
and
after
his
sick
father
had
had
to
flee
to
moscow
abandon
ing
to
pillage
his
dearly
beloved
bald
hills
which
he
had
built
and
peopled
.
but
despite
this
thanks
to
his
regiment
prince
andrew
had
something
to
think
about
entirely
apart
from
general
questions
.
two
days
previously
he
had
received
news
that
his
father
son
and
sister
had
left
for
moscow
and
though
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
at
bald
hills
prince
an
drew
with
a
characteristic
desire
to
foment
his
own
grief
decided
that
he
must
ride
there
.
he
ordered
his
horse
to
be
saddled
and
leav
ing
his
regiment
on
the
march
rode
to
his
fa
thers
estate
where
he
had
been
born
and
spent
his
childhood
.
riding
past
the
pond
where
there
used
always
to
be
dozens
of
women
chat
tering
as
they
rinsed
their
linen
or
beat
it
with
wooden
beetles
prince
andrew
noticed
that
there
was
not
a
soul
about
and
that
the
little
washing
wharf
torn
from
its
place
and
half
sub
merged
was
floating
on
its
side
in
the
middle
of
the
pond
.
he
rode
to
the
keepers
lodge
.
no
one
was
at
the
stone
entrance
gates
of
the
drive
and
the
door
stood
open
.
grass
had
already
be
gun
to
grow
on
the
garden
paths
and
horses
and
calves
were
straying
in
the
english
park
.
prince
andrew
rode
up
to
the
hothouse
some
of
the
glass
panes
were
broken
and
of
the
trees
in
tubs
some
were
overturned
and
others
dried
up
.
he
called
for
tards
the
gardener
but
no
one
replied
.
having
gone
round
the
corner
of
the
hothouse
to
the
ornamental
garden
he
saw
that
the
carved
garden
fence
was
broken
and
branches
of
the
plum
trees
had
been
torn
off
with
the
fruit
.
an
old
peasant
whom
prince
andrew
in
his
childhood
had
often
seen
at
the
gate
was
sitting
on
a
green
garden
seat
plait
ing
a
bast
shoe
.
he
was
deaf
and
did
not
hear
prince
andrew
ride
up
.
he
was
sitting
on
the
seat
the
old
prince
used
to
like
to
sit
on
and
beside
him
strips
of
bast
were
hanging
on
the
broken
and
withered
branch
of
a
magnolia
.
prince
andrew
rode
up
to
the
house
.
sev
eral
limes
in
the
old
garden
had
been
cut
down
and
a
piebald
mare
and
her
foal
were
wander
ing
in
front
of
the
house
among
the
rosebushes
.
the
shutters
were
all
closed
except
at
one
book
ten
401
window
which
was
open
.
a
little
serf
boy
see
ing
prince
andrew
ran
into
the
house
.
al
pdtych
having
sent
his
family
away
was
alone
at
bald
hills
and
was
sitting
indoors
reading
the
lives
of
the
saints
.
on
hearing
that
prince
andrew
had
come
he
went
out
with
his
spec
tacles
on
his
nose
buttoning
his
coat
and
hast
ily
stepping
up
without
a
word
began
weeping
and
kissing
prince
andrews
knee
.
then
vexed
at
his
own
weakness
he
turned
away
and
began
to
report
on
the
position
of
af
fairs
.
everything
precious
and
valuable
had
been
removed
to
bogucharovo
.
seventy
quar
ters
of
grain
had
also
been
carted
away
.
the
hay
and
the
spring
corn
of
which
alpdtych
said
there
had
been
a
remarkable
crop
that
year
had
been
commandeered
by
the
troops
and
mown
down
while
still
green
.
the
peas
ants
were
ruined
some
of
them
too
had
gone
to
bogucharovo
only
a
few
remained
.
without
waiting
to
hear
him
out
prince
an
drew
asked
when
did
my
father
and
sister
leave
meaning
when
did
they
leave
for
moscow
.
alpatych
understanding
the
question
to
re
fer
to
their
departure
for
boguchdrovo
re
plied
that
they
had
left
on
the
seventh
and
again
went
into
details
concerning
the
estate
management
asking
for
instructions
.
am
i
to
let
the
troops
have
the
oats
and
to
take
a
receipt
for
them
we
have
still
six
hun
dred
quarters
left
he
inquired
.
what
am
i
to
say
to
him
thought
prince
andrew
looking
down
on
the
old
mans
bald
head
shining
in
the
sun
and
seeing
by
the
ex
pression
on
his
face
that
the
old
man
himself
understood
how
untimely
such
questions
were
and
only
asked
them
to
allay
his
grief
.
yes
let
them
have
it
replied
prince
an
drew
.
if
you
noticed
some
disorder
in
the
garden
said
alpdtych
it
was
impossible
to
prevent
it
.
three
regiments
have
been
here
and
spent
the
night
dragoons
mostly
.
i
took
down
the
name
and
rank
of
their
commanding
officer
to
hand
in
a
complaint
about
it
.
well
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
will
you
stay
here
if
the
enemy
occupies
the
place
asked
prince
andrew
.
alpdtych
turned
his
face
to
prince
andrew
looked
at
him
and
suddenly
with
a
solemn
gesture
raised
his
arm
.
he
is
my
refuge
his
will
be
donel
he
ex
claimed
.
a
group
of
bareheaded
peasants
was
ap
proaching
across
the
meadow
toward
the
prince
.
well
goodbyl
said
prince
andrew
bend
ing
over
to
alpdtych
.
you
must
go
away
too
take
away
what
you
can
and
tell
the
serfs
to
go
to
the
ryazdn
estate
or
to
the
one
near
mos
cow
.
alpdtych
clung
to
prince
andrews
leg
and
burst
into
sobs
.
gently
disengaging
himself
the
prince
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
down
the
avenue
at
a
gallop
.
the
old
man
was
still
sitting
in
the
orna
mental
garden
like
a
fly
impassive
on
the
face
of
a
loved
one
who
is
dead
tapping
the
last
on
which
he
was
making
the
bast
shoe
and
two
littlegirls
running
out
from
the
hothouse
carry
ing
in
their
skirts
plums
they
had
plucked
from
the
trees
there
came
upon
prince
andrew
.
on
seeing
the
young
master
the
elder
one
with
frightened
look
clutched
her
younger
compan
ion
by
the
hand
and
hid
with
her
behind
a
birch
tree
not
stopping
to
pick
up
some
green
plums
they
had
dropped
.
prince
andrew
turned
away
with
startled
haste
unwilling
to
let
them
see
that
they
had
been
observed
.
he
was
sorry
for
the
pretty
frightened
little
girl
was
afraid
of
looking
at
her
and
yet
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
do
so
.
a
new
sensation
of
comfort
and
relief
came
over
him
when
seeing
these
girls
he
realized
the
existence
of
other
human
interests
entirely
aloof
from
his
own
and
just
as
legitimate
as
those
that
occupied
him
.
evidently
these
girls
passionately
desired
one
thing
to
carry
away
and
eat
those
green
plums
without
being
caught
and
prince
andrew
shared
their
wish
for
the
success
of
their
enterprise
.
he
could
not
resist
looking
at
them
once
more
.
believing
their
danger
past
they
sprang
from
their
ambush
and
chirruping
something
in
their
shrill
little
voices
and
holding
up
their
skirts
their
bare
little
sunburned
feet
scampered
merrily
and
quickly
across
the
meadow
grass
.
prince
andrew
was
somewhat
refreshed
by
having
ridden
off
the
dusty
highroad
along
which
the
troops
were
moving
.
but
not
far
from
bald
hills
he
again
came
out
on
the
road
and
overtook
his
regiment
at
its
halting
place
by
the
dam
of
a
small
pond
.
it
was
past
one
oclock
.
the
sun
a
red
ball
through
the
dust
burned
and
scorched
his
back
intolerably
through
his
black
coat
.
the
dust
always
hung
motionless
above
the
buzz
of
talk
that
came
from
the
resting
troops
.
there
was
no
wind
.
as
he
crossed
the
dam
prince
andrew
smelled
the
ooze
and
freshness
of
the
pond
.
he
longed
to
get
into
that
water
however
dirty
it
might
be
and
he
glanced
round
at
the
pool
from
40
war
and
peace
whence
came
sounds
of
shrieks
and
laughter
.
the
small
muddy
green
pond
had
risen
vis
ibly
more
than
a
foot
flooding
the
dam
be
cause
it
was
full
of
the
naked
white
bodies
of
soldiers
with
brickred
hands
necks
and
faces
who
were
splashing
about
in
it
.
all
this
naked
white
human
flesh
laughing
and
shrieking
floundered
about
in
that
dirty
pool
like
carp
stuffed
into
a
watering
can
and
the
suggestion
of
merriment
in
that
floundering
mass
rendered
it
specially
pathetic
.
one
fairhaired
young
soldier
of
the
third
company
whom
prince
andrew
knew
and
who
had
a
strap
round
the
calf
of
one
leg
crossed
himself
stepped
back
to
get
a
good
run
and
plunged
into
the
water
another
a
dark
noncommissioned
officer
who
was
always
shag
gy
stood
up
to
his
waist
in
the
water
joyfully
wriggling
his
muscular
figure
and
snorted
with
satisfaction
as
he
poured
the
water
over
his
head
with
hands
blackened
to
the
wrists
.
there
were
sounds
of
men

were
in

that

rather

from

by
the
sight
of
that
immense
number
of

splashing

.
on
the
seventh
of
august
prince
bagrati6n
wrote
as
follows
from
his
quarters
at
mikhay
lovka
on
the
smolensk
road
dear
count
alexis
andrevich
he
was
writ
ing
to
arakcheev
but
knew
that
his
letter
would
be
read
by
the
emperor
and
therefore
weighed
every
word
in
it
to
the
best
of
his
ability
.
i
expect
the
minister
barclay
de
tolly
has
al
ready
reported
the
abandonment
of
smolensk
to
the
enemy
.
it
is
pitiable
and
sad
and
the
whole
army
is
in
despair
that
this
most
important
place
has
been
wantonly
abandoned
.
i
for
my
part
begged
him
personally
most
urgently
and
finally
wrote
him
but
nothing
would
induce
him
to
con
sent
.
i
swear
to
you
on
my
honor
that
napoleon
was
in
such
a
fix
as
never
before
and
might
have
lost
half
his
army
but
could
not
have
taken
smo
lensk
.
our
troops
fought
and
are
fighting
as
never
before
.
with
fifteen
thousand
men
i
held
the
enemy
at
bay
for
thirtyfive
hours
and
beat
him
but
he
would
not
hold
out
even
for
fourteen
hours
.
it
is
disgraceful
a
stain
on
our
army
and
as
for
him
he
ought
it
seems
to
me
not
to
live
.
if
he
reports
that
our
losses
were
great
it
is
not
true
perhaps
about
four
thousand
not
more
and
not
even
that
but
even
were
they
ten
thousand
thats
war
but
the
enemy
has
lost
masses
.

.

.

.
what
would
it
have
cost
him
to
hold
out
for
another
two
days
they
would
have
had
to
retire
of
their
own
accord
for
they
had
no
water
for
men
or
horses
.
he
gave
me
his
word
he
would
not
re
treat
but
suddenly
sent
instructions
that
he
was
retiring
that
night
.
we
cannot
fight
in
this
way
or
we
may
soon
bring
the
enemy
to
moscow
.

.

.

.
there
is
a
rumor
that
you
are
thinking
of
peace
.
god
forbid
that
you
should
make
peace
after
all
our
sacrifices
and
such
insane
retreats
you
would
set
all
russia
against
you
and
every
one
of
us
would
feel
ashamed
to
wear
the
uniform
.
if
it
has
come
to
this
we
must
fight
as
long
as
russia
can
and
as
long
as
there
are
men
able
to
stand
.

.

.

.
one
man
ought
to
be
in
command
and
not
two
.
your
minister
may
perhaps
be
good
as
a
minister
but
as
a
general
he
is
not
merely
bad
but
execra
ble
yet
to
him
is
entrusted
the
fate
of
our
whole
country
.

..
.
i
am
really
frantic
with
vexation
for
give
my
writing
boldly
.
it
is
clear
that
the
man
who
advocates
the
conclusion
of
a
peace
and
that
the
minister
should
command
the
army
does
not
love
our
sovereign
and
desires
the
ruin
of
us
all
.
so
i
write
you
frankly
call
out
the
militia
.
for
the
minister
is
leading
these
visitors
after
him
to
mos
cow
in
a
most
masterly
way
.
the
whole
army
feels
great
suspicion
of
the
imperial
aidedecamp
wol
zogen
.
he
is
said
to
be
more
napoleons
man
than
ouis
and
he
is
always
advising
the
minister
.
i
am
not
merely
civil
to
him
but
obey
him
like
a
cor
poral
though
i
am
his
senior
.
this
is
painful
but
loving
my
benefactor
and
sovereign
submit
.
only
i
am
sorry
for
the
emperor
that
he
entrusts
our
fine
army
to
such
as
he
.
consider
that
on
our
re
treat
we
have
lost
by
fatigue
and
left
in
the
hos
pital
more
than
fifteen
thousand
men
and
had
we
attacked
this
would
not
have
happened
.
tell
me
for
gods
sake
what
will
russia
our
mother
russia
say
to
our
being
so
frightened
and
why
are
we
abandoning
our
good
and
gallant
father
land
to
such
rabble
and
implanting
feelings
of
book
ten
403
hatred
and
shame
in
all
our
subjects
what
are
we
scared
at
and
of
whom
are
we
afraid
i
am
not
to
blame
that
the
minister
is
vacillating
a
coward
dense
dilatory
and
has
all
bad
qualities
.
the
whole
army
bewails
it
and
calls
down
curses
upon
him

among
the
innumerable
categories
applicable
to
the
phenomena
of
human
life
one
may
dis
criminate
between
those
in
which
substance
prevails
and
those
in
which
form
prevails
.
to
the
latter
as

even

lifewe
may
allot
petersburg
life
and
especially
the
life
of
its
salons
.
that
life
of
the
salons
is
unchanging
.
since
the
year
1805
we
had
made
peace
and
had
again
quarreled
with
bonaparte
and
had
made
constitutions
and
unmade
them
again
but
the
salons
of
anna
pavlovnaand
helene
remained
just
as
they
had
been
the
one
seven
and
the
other
five
years
before
.
at
anna
pavlovnas
they
talked
with
perplexity
of
bonapartes
suc
cesses
just
as
before
and
saw
in
them
and
in
the
subservience
shown
to
him
by
the
european
sovereigns
a
malicious
conspiracy
the
sole
ob
ject
of
which
was
to
cause
unpleasantness
and
anxiety
to
the
court
circle
of
which
anna
pav
lovna
was
the
representative
.
and
in
helenes
salon
which
rumyantsev

himself
honored
with
his
visits
regarding
helene
as
a
remark
ably
intelligent
woman
they
talked
with
the
same
ecstacy
in
1812
as
in
1808
of
the
great
nation
and
the
great
manandregrettedour
rupture
with
france
a
rupture
which
accord
ing
to
them
ought
to
be
promptly
terminated
by
peace
.
of
late
since
the
emperors
return
from
the
army
there
had
been
some
excitement
in
these
conflicting
salon
circles
and
some
demonstra
tions
of
hostility
to
one
another
but
each
camp
retained
its
own
tendency
.
in
anna
pavlovnas
circle
only
those
frenchmen
were
admitted
who
were
deeprooted
legitimists
and
patriotic
views
were
expressed
to
the
effect
that
one
ought
not
to
go
to
the
french
theater
and
that
to
maintain
the
french
troupe
was
costing
the
government
as
much
as
a
whole
army
corps
.
the
progress
of
the
war
was
eagerly
followed
and
only
the
reports
most
flattering
to
our
ar
my
were
circulated
.
in
the
french
circle
of
he
lene
and
rumyantsev
the
reports
of
the
cruel
ty
of
the

and
of
the

were

in

dowager

.
in
helenas
circle
the
war
in

was
regarded
as
a
se
ries
of
formal
demonstrations
which
would
very
soon
end

reached

simultaneously
with

ridiculed

very
clev

with
much
caution

anna

circle
on
the
contrary
was
enraptured
by
this
enthusiasm
and
spoke
of
it
as

prince

who
still
occupied
his

circles

he

in

said
at

what
he

soon
after
the
emperors
return
prince
va
sili
in
a
conversation
about
the
war
at
anna
pavlovnas
severely
condemned
barclay
de
tol
ly
but
was
undecided
as
to
who
ought
to
be
appointed
commander
in
chief
.
one
of
the
visitors
usually
spoken
of
as
a
man
of
great
merit
having
described
how
he
had
that
day
seen
kutuzov
the
newly
chosen
chief
of
the
petersburg
militia
presiding
over
the
enroll
ment
of
recruits
at
the
treasury
cautiously
ventured
to
suggest
that
kutuzov
would
be
the
man
to
satisfy
all
requirements
.
anna
pavlovna
remarked
with
a
melancholy
smile
that
kutuzov
had
done
nothing
but
cause
the
emperor
annoyance
.
i
have
talked
and
talked
at
the
assembly
of
the
nobility
prince
vasili
interrupted
but
they
did
not
listen
to

.
i
told
them
his
elec

as

of

would
not
please

they
did

.
its
all
this
mania
for
opposition
he
went
on
.
and
who
for
it
is
all
because
we
want
to
ape
the
foolish
enthusiasm
of
those
musco
vites
prince
vasili
continued
forgetting
for
a
moment
that
though
at
helenes
one
had
to
ridicule
the
moscow
enthusiasm
at
anna
pav
lovnas
one
had
to
be
ecstatic
about
it
.
but
he

and

retrieved
his
mistake
at
once
.
now
is
it
suit
able
that
count
kutuzov
the
oldest
general
in
russia
should
preside
at
that
tribunal
he
will
get
nothing
for
his
pains
how
could
they
make
a
man
commander
in
chief
who
cannot
mount
a
horse
who
drops
asleep
at
a
council
and
has
the
very
worst
morals
1
a
good
reputa
tion
he
made
for
himself
at
bucharest
i
dont
speak
of
his
capacity
as
a
general
but
at
a
time
like
this
how
can
they
appoint
a
decrepit
blind
old
man
positively
blind
a
fine
idea
to
have
a
blind
general
he
cant
see
anything
.
to
play
blindmans
bluff
he
cant
see
at
all
no
one
replied
to
his
remarks
.
this
was
quite
correct
on
the
twentyfourth
of
july
.
but
on
the
twentyninth
of
july
ku
tuzov
received
the
title
of
prince
.
this
might
indicate
a
wish
to
get
rid
of
him
and
therefore
prince
vasilis
opinion
continued
to
be
correct
though
he
was
not
now
in
any
hurry
to
express
it
.
but
on
the
eighth
of
august
a
committee
consisting
of
field
marshal
saltyk6v
arak
chev
vyazmitinov
lopukhin
and
kochuby
met
to
consider
the
progress
of
the
war
.
this
commit
tee
came
to
the
conclusion
that
our
fail
ures
were
due
to
a
want
of
unity
in
the
com
mand
and
though
the
members
of
the
commit
tee
were
aware
of
the
emperors
dislike
of
ku
tuzov
after
a
short
deliberation
they
agreed
to
advise
his
appointment
as
commander
in
chief
.
that
same
day
kutuzov
was
appointed
com
mander
in
chief
with
full
powers
over
the
armies
and
over
the
whole
region
occupied
by
them
.
on
the
ninth
of
august
prince
vasfli
at
an
na
pdvlovnas
again
met
the
man
of
great
merit
.
the
latter
was
very
attentive
to
anna
pavlovna
because
he
wanted
to
be
appointed
director
of
one
of
the
educational
establish
ments
for
young
ladies
.
prince
vasili
entered
the
room
with
the
air
of
a
happy
conqueror
who
has
attained
the
object
of
his
desires
.
well
have
you
heard
the
great
news
prince
kutuzov
is
field
marshal
all
dissensions
are
at
an
end
i
am
so
glad
so
delighted
at
last
we
have
a
man
said
he
glancing
sternly
and
significantly
round
at
everyone
in
the
draw
ing
room
.
the
man
of
great
merit
despite
his
desire
to
obtain
thepost
of
director
could
not
refrain
from
reminding
prince
vasili
of
his
former
opinion
.
though
this
was
impolite
to
prince
vasili
in

and
also
to
anna
pavlovna
herself
who
had
re
ceived
the
news
with
delight
he
could
not

sist
the
temptation
but

he
reminding
prince

of
his
own

eh
nonsense

well

said
prince
vasili
rapidly
in
a
deep
voice
and
with
a
slight
coughthe
voice
and
cough
with
which
he
was
wont
to
dispose
of
all
difficulties
.
he
sees
well
enough
he
added
.
and
what
i
am
so
pleased
about
he
went
on
is
that
our

has
given
him
full
powers
over
all
the
armies
and
the
whole
region

ers
no

ever
had
before

he
is

concluded
with
a
vic
torious
smile
.

was

circles
wishing
to
flatter
anna
pdvlovna
by
defending
her
former
position
on
this
question
observed
it
is
said
that
the
emperor
was
reluctant
to
give
kutuzov
those
powers
.
they
say
he
blushed
like

when
he
said
to
kutuzov
your

the

award
you

perhaps
the
heart
took
no
part
in
that
speech
said
anna
pdvlovna
.
oh
no
no

rejoined
prince
vasili
who
would
not

opinion

was
adored
by
everybody

him
so

do

chapter
vii
while
this
was
taking
place
in
petersburg
the
french
had
already
passed
smolensk
and
were
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
moscow
.
napo
leons
historian
thiers
like
other
of
his
his
torians
trying
to
justify
his
hero
says
that
he
was
drawn
to
the
walls
of
moscow
against
his
will
.
he
is
as
right
as
other
historians
who
look
for
the
explanation
of
historic
events
in
the
will
of
one
man
he
is
as
right
as
the
russian
historians
who
maintain
that
napoleon
was
drawn
to
moscow
by
the
skill
of
the
russian
commanders
.
here
besides
the
law
of
retrospec
tion
which
regards
all
the
past
as
a
prepara
tion
for
events
that
subsequently
occur
the
law
of
reciprocity
comes
in
confusing
the
whole
matter
.
a
good
chessplayer
having
lost
a
game
is
sincerely
convinced
that
his
loss
resulted
from
a
mistake
he
made
and
looks
for
that
mis
take
in
the
opening
but
forgets
that
at
each
stage
of
the
game
there
were
similar
mistakes
and
that
none
of
his
moves
were
perfect
.
he
only
notices
the
mistake
to
which
he
pays
at
tention
because
his
opponent
took
advantage
of
it
.
how
much
more
complex
than
this
is
the
game
of
war
which
occurs
under
certain
limits
of
time
and
where
it
is
not
one
will
that
ma
nipulates

everything
results

an

he
overtook
napo

at
a
gallop
and
reined
in
his
horse
with
an
amused
expression
.
well
asked
napoleon
.
one
of
platovs
cossacks
says
that
pldtovs

is
joining
up
with
the
main
army
and
that
kutiizov
has
been
appointed
commander
in
chief
.
he
is
a
very
shrewd
and
garrulous
fellow
.
napoleon
smiled
and
told
them
to
give
the
cossack
a
horse
and
bring
the
man
to
him
.
he
wished
to
talk
to
him
himself
.
several
adju
tants
galloped
off
and
an
hour
later
lavriish
ka
the
serf
denfsov
had
handed
over
to
ros
t6v
rode
up
to
napoleon
in
an
orderlys
jack
et
and
on
a
french
cavalry
saddle
with
a
ro
guish
merry
and
tipsy
face
.
napoleon
told
him
to
ride
by
his
side
and
began
questioning
him
.
you
are
a
cossack
yes
a
cossack
your
honor
.
the
cossack
not
knowing
in
what
com
pany
he
was
for
napoleons
plain
appearance
had
nothing
about
it
that
would
reveal
to
an
oriental
mind
the
presence
of
a
monarch
talked
with
extreme
familiarity
of
the
incidents
of
the
war
says
thiers
narrating
this
episode
.
in
reality
lavriishka
having
got
drunk
the
day
before
and
left
his
master
dinnerless
had
been
whipped
and
sent
to
the
village
in
quest
of
chickens
where
he
engaged
in
looting
till
the
french
took
him
prisoner
.
lavriishka
was
one
of
those
coarse
barefaced
lackeys
who
have
seen
all
sorts
of
things
consider
it
neces
sary
to
do
everything
in
a
mean
and
cunning
way
are
ready
to
render
any
sort
of
service
to
their
master
and
are
keen
at
guessing
their
masters
baser
impulses
especially
those
prompted
by
vanity
and
pettiness
.
finding
himself
in
the
company
of
napole
on
whose
identity
he
had
easily
and
surely
rec
ognized
lavriishka
was
not
in
the
least
abashed
but
merely
did
his
utmost
to
gain
his
new
mas
ters
favor
.
he
knew
very
well
that
this
was
napoleon
but
napoleons
presence
could
no
more
intim
idate
him
than
rost6vs
or
a
sergeant
majors
with
the
rods
would
have
done
for
he
had
nothing
that
either
the
sergeant
major
or
na
poleon
could
deprive
him
of
.
so
he
rattled
on
telling
all
the
gossip
he
had
heard
among
the
orderlies
.
much
of
it
was
true
.
but
when
napoleon
asked
him
whether
the
russians
thought
they
would
beat
bonaparte
or
not
lavriishka
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
con
sidered
.
406
war
and
peace
in
this
question
he
saw
subtle
cunning
as
men
of
his
type
see
cunning
in
everything
so
he
frowned
and
did
not
answer
immediately
.
its
like
this
he
said
thoughtfully
if
theres
a
battle
soon
yours
will
win
.
thats
right
.
but
if
three
days
pass
then
after
that
well
then
that
same
battle
will
not
soon
be
over
.
lelorgne
dideville
smilingly
interpreted
this
speech
to
napoleon
thus
if
a
battle
takes
place
within
the
next
three
days
the
french
will
win
but
if
later
god
knows
what
will
happen
.
napoleon
did
not
smile
though
he
was
evidently
in
high
good
humor
and
he
or
dered
these
words
to
be
repeated
.
lavrushka
noticed
this
and
to
entertain
him
further
pretending
not
to
know
who
napo
leon
was
added
we
know
that
you
have
bonaparte
and
that
he
has
beaten
everybody
in
the
world
but
we
are
a
different
matter

.

.

.without
knowing
why
or
how
this
bit
of
boastful
patriotism
slipped
out
at
the
end
.
the
interpreter
translated
these
words
with
out
the
last
phrase
and
bonaparte
smiled
.
the
young
cossack
made
his
mighty
inter
locutor
smile
says
thiers
.
after
riding
a
few
paces
in
silence
napoleon
turned
to
berthier
and
said
he
wished
to
see
how
the
news
that
he
was
talking
to
the
emperor
himself
to
that
very
emperor
who
had
written
his
immortally
victorious
name
on
the
pyramids
would
affect
this
enfant
du
don
.
1
the
fact
was
accordingly
conveyed
tolavru
shka
.
la
vrtishka
understanding
that
this
was
done
to
perplex
him
and
that
napoleon
expected
him
to
be
frightened
to
gratify
his
new
mas
ters
promptly
pretended
to
be
astonished
and
awestruck
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
assumed
the
expression
he
usually
put
on
when
taken
to
be
whipped
.
as
soon
as
napoleons
inter
preter
had
spoken
says
thiers
the
cossack
seized
by
amazement
did
not
utter
another
word
but
rode
on
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
con
queror
whose
fame
had
reached
him
across
the
steppes
of
the
east
.
all
his
loquacity
was
sud
denly
arrested
and
replaced
by
a
naive
and
si
lent
feeling
of
admiration
.
napoleon
after
making
the
cossack
a
present
had
him
set
free
like
a
bird
restored
to
its
native
fields
.
napoleon
rode
on
dreaming
of
the
moscow
that
so
appealed
to
his
imagination
and
the
bird
restored
to
its
native
fields
galloped
to
our
outposts
inventing
on
the
way
all
that
had

not
taken
place
but
that
he
meant
to
relate
to
his
comrades
.
what
had
really
taken
place
he
did
not
wish
to
relate
because
it
seemed
to
him
not
worth
telling
.
he
found
the
cossacks
in
quired
for
the
regiment
operating
with

detachment
and
by
evening
found
his
master

mounting
to
go
for

chapter
viii
princess
mary
was
not
in
moscow
and
out
of
danger
as
prince
andrew
supposed
.
after
the
return
of
alpatych
from
smolensk
the
old
prince
suddenly
seemed
to
awake
as
from
a
dream
.
he
ordered
the
militiamen
to
be
called
up
from
the
villages
and
armed
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
commander
in
chief
in
forming
him
that
he
had
resolved
to
remain
at
bald
hills
to
the
last
extremity
and
to
defend
it
leaving
to
the
commander
in
chiefs
discre
tion
to
take
measures
or
not
for
the
defense
of
bald
hills
where
one
of
russias
oldest
gen
erals
would
be
captured
or
killed
and
he
an
nounced
to
his
household
that
he
would
re
main
at
bald
hills
.
but
while
himself
remaining
he
gave
in
structions
for
the
departure
of
the
princess
and
dessalles
with
the
little
prince
to
boguchdrovo
and
thence
to
moscow
.
princess
mary
alarmed
by
her
fathers
feverish
and
sleepless
activity
after
his
previous
apathy
could
not
bring
her
self
to
leave
him
alone
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
ventured
to
disobey
him
.
she
refused
to
go
away
arid
her
fathers
fury
broke
over
her
in
a
terrible
storm
.
he
repeated
every
injustice
he
had
ever
inflicted
on
her
.
trying
to
convict
her
he
told
her
she
had
worn
him
out
had
caused
his
quarrel
with
his
son
had
harbored
nasty
suspicions
of
him
making
it
the
object
of
her
life
to
poison
his
existence
and
he
drove
her
from
his
study
telling
her
that
if
she
did
not
go
away
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
.
he
de
clared
that
he
did
not
wish
to
remember
her
existence
and
warned
her
not
to
dare
to
let
him
see
her
.
the
fact
that
he
did
not
as
she
had
feared
order
her
to
be
carried
away
by
force
but
only
told
her
not
to
let
him
see
her
cheered
princess
mary
.
she
knew
it
was
a
proof
that
in
the
depth
of
his
soul
he
was
glad
she
was
remaining
at
home
and
had
not
gone
away
.
the
morning
after
little
nicholas
had
left
the
old
prince
donned
his
full
uniform
and
prepared
to
visit
the
commander
in
chief
.
his
book
ten
407
cauche
was
already
at
the
door
.
princess
mary
saw
him
walk
out
of
the
house
in
his
uniform
wearing
all
his
orders
and
go
down
the
garden
to
review
his
armed
peasants
and
domestic
serfs
.
she
sat
by
the
window
listening
to
his
voice
which
reached
her
from
the
garden
.
sud
denly
several
men
came
running
up
the
avenue
with
frightened
faces
.
princess
mary
ran
out
to
the
porch
down
the
flowerbordered
path
and
into
the
avenue
.
a
large
crowd
of
militiamen
and
domestics
were
moving
toward
her
and
in
their
midst
several
men
were
supporting
by
the
armpits
and
dragging
along
a
little
old
man
in
a
uni
form
and
decorations
.
she
ran
up
to
him
and
in
the
play
of
the
sunlight
that
fell
in
small
round
spots
through
the
shade
of
the
limetree
avenue
could
not
be
sure
what
change
there
was
in
his
face
.
all
she
could
see
was
that
his
former
stern
and
determined
expression
had
altered
to
one
of
timidity
and
submission
.
on
seeing
his
daughter
he
moved
his
helpless
lips
and
made
a
hoarse
sound
.
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
what
he
wanted
.
he
was
lifted
up
carried
to
his
study
and
laid
on
the
very
couch
he
had
so
feared
of
late
.
the
doctor
who
was
fetched
that
same
night
bled
him
and
said
that
the
prince
had
had
a
seizure
paralyzing
his
right
side
.
it
was
becoming
more
and
more
dangerous
to
remain
at
bald
hills
and
next
day
they
moved
the
prince
to
bogucharovo
the
doctor
accompanying
him
.
by
the
time
they
reached
bogucharovo
des
salles
and
the
little
prince
had
already
left
for
moscow
.
for
three
weeks
the
old
prince
lay
stricken
by
paralysis
in
the
new
house
prince
andrew
had
built
at
bogucharovo
ever
in
the
same
state
getting
neither
better
nor
worse
.
he
was
unconscious
and
lay
like
a
distorted
corpse
.
he
muttered
unceasingly
his
eyebrows
and
lips
twitching
and
it
was
impossible
to
tell
wheth
er
he
understood
what
was
going
on
around
him
or
not
.
one
thing
was
certain
that
he
was
suffering
and
wished
to
say
something
.
but
what
it
was
no
one
could
tell
it
might
be
some
caprice
of
a
sick
and
halfcrazy
man
or
it
might
relate
to
public
affairs
or
possibly
to
family
concerns
.
the
doctor
said
this
restlessness
did
not
mean
anything
and
was
due
to
physical
causes
but
princess
mary
thought
he
wished
to
tell
her
something
and
the
fact
that
her
presence
always
increased
his
restlessness
confirmed
her
opinion
.
he
was
evidently
suffering
both
physically
and
mentally
.
there
was
no
hope
of
recovery
.
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
travel
it
would
not
do
to
let
him
die
on
the
road
.
would
it
not
be
better
if
the
end
did
come
the
very
end
princess
mary
sometimes
thought
.
night
and
day
hardly
sleeping
at
all
she
watched
him
and
terrible
to
say
often
watched
him
not
with
hope
of
finding
signs
of
improvement
but
wishing
to
find
symptoms
of
the
approach
of
the
end
.
strange
as
it
was
to
her
to
acknowledge
this
feeling
in
herself
yet
there
it
was
.
and
what
seemed
still
more
terrible
to
her
was
that
since
her
fathers
illness
began
perhaps
even
sooner
when
she
stayed
with
him
expectingsomething
to

all
the
personal
desires
and
hopes
that
had
been

or

within
her
had
awakened
.
thoughts
that
had
not
entered
her
mind
for
yearsthoughts
of
a
life
free
from
the
fear
of
her
father
and
even
the
possibility
of
love
and
of
family
happiness
floated
con
tinually
in
her
imagination
like
temptations
of
the
devil
.
thrust
them
aside
as
she
would
questions
continually
recurred
to
her
as
to
how
she
would
order
her
life
now
after
that
.
these
were
temptations
of
the
devil
and
princess
mary
knew
it
.
she
knew
that
the
sole
weapon
against
him
was
prayer
and
she
tried
to
pray
.
she
assumed
an
attitude
of
prayer
looked
at
the
icons
repeated
the
words
of
a
prayer
but
she
could
not
pray
.
she
felt
that
a
different
world
had
now
taken
possession
of
her
the
life
of
a
world
of
strenuous
and
free
activity
quite
opposed
to
the
spiritual
world
in
which
till
now
she
had
been
confined
and
in
which
her
greatest
comfort
had
been
prayer
.
she
could
not
pray
could
not
weep
and
worldly
cares
took
possession
of
her
.
it
was
becoming
dangerous
to
remain
in
bogucharovo
.
news
of
the
approach
of
the
french
came
from
all
sides
and
in
one
village
ten
miles
from
boguchdrovo
a

been

the
head
of

urged
the

thing

that
the

which
everyone
came
to
her
occu
pied
her
all
day
.
she
spent
the
night
of
the
fourteenth
as
usual
without
undressing
in
the
room
next
to
the
one
where
the
prince
lay
.
several
times
waking
up
she
heard
his
groans
and
muttering
the
creak
of
his
bed
and
the
steps
of
tikhon
and
the
doctor
when
they
turned
him
over
.
several
times
she
listened
at
the
door
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
mutter
ings
were
louder
than
usual
and
that
they
turned
him
over
oftener
.
she
could
not
sleep
and
several
times
went
to
the
door
and
listened
wishing
to
enter
but
not
deciding
to
do
so
.
though
he
did
riot
speak
princess
mary
saw
and
knew
how
unpleasant
every
sign
of
anxiety
on
his
account
was
to
him
.
she
had
noticed
with
what
dissatisfaction
he
turned
from
the
look
she
sometimes
involuntarily
fixed
on
him
.
she
knew
that
her
going
in
during
the
night
at
an
unusual
hour
would
irritate
him
.
but
never
had
she
felt
so
grieved
for
him
or
so
much
afraid
of
losing
him
.
she
recalled
all
her
life
with
him
and
in
every
word
and
act
of
his
found
an
expression
of
his
love
of
her
.
occa
sionally
amid
these
memories
temptations
of
the
devil
would
surge
into
her
imagination
thoughts
of
how
things
would
be
after
his
death
and
how
her
new
liberated
life
would
be
ordered
.
but
she
drove
these
thoughts
away
with
disgust
.
toward
morning
he
became
quiet
and
she
fell
asleep
.
she
woke
late
.
that
sincerity
which
often
comes
with
waking
showed
her
clearly
what
chiefly
concerned
her
about
her
fathers
illness
.
on
waking
she
listened
to
what
was
going
on
behind
the
door
and
hearing
him
groan
said
to
herself
with
a
sigh
that
things
were
still
the
same
.
but
what
could
have
happened
what
did
i
want
i
want
his
death
she
cried
with
a
feeling
of
loathing
for
herself
.
she
washed
dressed
said
her
prayers
and
went
out
to
the
porch
.
in
front
of
it
stood
car
nages
without
horses
and
things
were
being
packed
into
the
vehicles
.
it
was
a
warm
gray
morning
.
princess
mary
stopped
at
the
porch
still
horrified
by
her
spiritual
baseness
and
trying
to
arrange
her
thoughts
before
going
to
her
father
.
the
doc
tor
came
downstairs
and
went
out
to
her
.
he
is
a
little
better
today
said
he
.
i
was
looking
for
you

make

of

for
you

.

.
princess
marys
heart
beat
so
violently
at
this
news
that
she
grew
pale
and
leaned
against
the
wall
to
keep
from
falling
.
to
see
him
talk
to
him
feel
his
eyes
on
her
now
that
her
whole
soul
was
overflowing
with
those
dreadful
wicked
temptations
was
a
torment
of
joy
and
terror
.
come
said
the
doctor
.
princess
mary
entered
her
fathers
room
and
went
up
to
his
bed
.
he
was
lying
on
his
back
propped
up
high
and
his
small
bony
hands
with
their
knotted
purple
veins
were
lying
on
the
quilt
his
left
eye
gazed
straight
before
him
his
right
eye
was
awry
and
his
brows
and
lips
motionless
.
he
seemed
altogether
so
thin
small
and
pathetic
.
his
face
seemed
to
have
shriveled
or
melted
his
features
had
grown
smaller
.
princess
mary
went
up
and
kissed
his
hand
.
his
left
hand
pressed
hers
so
that
she
understood
that
he
had
long
been
waiting
for
her
to
come
.
he
twitched
her
hand
and
his
brows
and
lips
quivered
angrily
.
she
looked
at
him
in
dismay
trying
to
guess
what
he
wanted
of
her
.
when
she
changed
her
position
so
that
his
left
eye
could
see
her
face
he
calmed
down
not
taking
his
eyes
off
her
for
some
seconds
.
then
his
lips
and
tongue
moved
sounds
came
and
he
begati
to
speak
gazing
timidly
and
imploringly
at
her
evidently
afraid
that
she
might
not
understand
.
straining
all
her
faculties
princess
mary
looked
at
him
.
the
comic
efforts
with
which
he
moved
his
tongue
made
her
drop
her
eyes
and
with
difficulty
repress
the
sobs
that
rose
to
her
throat
.
he
said
something
repeating
the
same
words
several
times
.
she
could
not
under
stand
them
but
tried
to
guess
what
he
was

ing
and
inquiringly
repeated
the
words

he
repeated
several
times
.
it
was
quite
impossible
to
understand
these
sounds
.
the
doctor
thought
he
had
guessed
them
and
inquiringly
repeated

are

afraid
the
prince
shook
his
head
and
again
repeated
the
same
sounds
.

princess

.
he
made
a
mumbling
sound
in
confirma

of
this
took
her
hand
and
began
pressing
it
to
different
parts
of
his

princess

could
not
quite
make
out
what

said
but
from
his
look
it
was
clear
that
he
had
uttered
a
tender
caressing
word
such
as
he
had
never
used
to
her
before
.

and
tears
began
to

eyes

call
andrew
he
said
suddenly
and
a
childish
timid
expression
of
doubt
showed
itself
on
his
face
as
he
spoke
.
he
himself
seemed
aware
that
his
demand
was
meaningless
.
so
at
least
it
seemed
to
prin
cess
mary
.
i

a
letter
from
him
she
replied
.
he
glanced
at
her
with
timid
surprise
.
where
is
he
hes
with
the
army
father
at
smolensk
.
he
closed
his
eyes
and
remained
silent
a
long
time
.
then
as
if
in
answer
to
his
doubts
and
to
confirm
the
fact
that
now
he
under
stood
and
remembered
everything
he
nodded
his
head
and
reopened
his
eyes
.
yes
he
said
softly
and
distinctly
.
russia
has
perished
.
theyve
destroyed
her
.
and
he
began
to
sob
and
again
tears
flowed
from
his
eyes
.
princess
mary
could
no
longer
restrain
herself
and
wept
while
she
gazed
at
his
face
.
again
he
closed
his
eyes
.
his
sobs
ceased
he
pointed
to
his
eyes
and
tfkhon
understand
ing
him
wiped
away
the
tears
.
then
he
again
opened
his
eyes
and
said
something
none
of
them
could
understand
for
a
long
time
till
at
last
tikhon
understood
and
repeated
it
.
princess
mary
had
sought
the
mean
ing
of
his
words
in
the
mood
in
which
he
had
just
been
speaking
.
she
thought
he
was
speak
ing
of
russia
or
prince
andrew
of
herself
of
his
grandson
or
of
his
own
death
and
so
she
could
not
guess
his
words
.
put
on
your
white
dress
.
i
like
it
was
what
he
said
.
having
understood
this
princess
mary
sobbed
still
louder
and
the
doctor
taking
her
arm
led
her
out
to
the
veranda
soothing
her
and
trying
to
persuade
her
to
prepare
for
her
journey
.
when
she
had
left
the
room
the
prince
again
began
speaking
about
his
son
about
the
war
and
about
the
emperor
angrily
twitching
his
brows
and
raising
his
hoarse
voice
and
then
he
had
a
second
and
final
stroke
.
princess
mary
stayed
on
the
veranda
.
the
day
had
cleared
it
was
hot
and
sunny
.
she
could
understand
nothing
think
of
nothing
and
feel
nothing
except
passionate
love
for
her
father
love
such
as
she
thought
she
had
never
felt
till
that
moment
.
she
ran
out
sob
bing
into
the
garden
and
as
far
as
the
pond
along
the
avenues
of
young
lime
trees
prince
andrew
had
planted
.

.
and
what
will
become
of
me
what
use

peace
be
when
he
is
no
longer
here
princess
mary
murmured
pacing
the
garden
with
hurried
steps
and
pressing
her
hands
to
her
bosom
which
heaved
with
con
vulsive
sobs
.
when
she
had
completed
the
tour
of
the
garden
which
brought
her
again
to
the
house
she
saw
mademoiselle
bourienne
who
had
re
mained
at
bogucharovo
and
did
not
wish
to
leave
itcoming
toward
her
with
a
stranger
.
this
was
the
marshal
of
the
nobility
of
the
district
who
had
come
personally
to
point
out
to
the
princess
the
necessity
for
her
prompt
de
parture
.
princess
mary
listened
without
under
standing
him
she
led
him
to
the
house
offered
him
lunch
and
sat
down
with
him
.
then
excusing
herself
she
went
to
the
door
of
the
old
princes
room
.
the
doctor
came
out
with
an
agitated
face
and
said
she
could
not
enter
.
go
away
princess
go
away

..
.
go
away
she
returned
to
the
garden
and
sat
down
on
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
by
the
pond
where
no
one
could
see
her
.
she
did
not
know
how
long
she
had
been
there
when
she
was
aroused
by
the
sound
of
a
womans
footsteps
running
along
the
path
.
she
rose
and
saw
dun
yasha
her
maid
who
was
evidently
looking
for
her
and
who
stopped
suddenly
as
if
in
alarm
on
seeing
her
mistress

the

her
.
in
the
room
were
her

other
women

they
all
drew
back
from
the
bed
making
way
for

.
he
was
still
lying
on

the
stern

face
made

pressed

stepped

all

died
on
the
accession
of
his
wife
catherine
ii
to
the
throne
in
book
ers
.
hundreds
of
peasants
among
them
the
boguchdrovo
folk
suddenly
began
selling
their
cattle
and
moving
in
whole
families
toward
the
southeast
.
as
birds
migrate
to
somewhere
beyond
the
sea
so
these
men
with
their
wives
and
children
streamed
to
the
southeast
to
parts
where
none
of
them
had
ever
been
.
they
set
off
in
caravans
bought
their
freedom
one
by
one
or
ran
away
and
drove
or
walked
toward
the
warm
rivers
.
many
of
them
were
pun
ished
some
sent
to
siberia
many
died
of
cold
and
hunger
on
the
road
many
returned
of
their
own
accord
and
the
movement
died
down
of
itself
just
as
it
had
sprung
up
without
ap
parent
reason
.
but
such
undercurrents
still
existed
among
the
people
and
gathered
new
forces
ready
to
manifest
themselves
just
as
strangely
unexpectedly
and
at
the
same
time
simply
naturally
and
forcibly
.
now
in
1812
to
anyone
living
in
close
touch
with
these
peo
ple
it
was
apparent
that
these
undercurrents
were
acting
strongly
and
nearing
an
eruption
.
alpdtych
who
had
reached
boguchdrovo
shortly
before
the
old
princes
death
noticed
an
agitation
among
the
peasants
and
that
con
trary
to
what
was
happening
in
the
bald
hills
district
where
over
a
radius
of
forty
miles
all
the
peasants
were
moving
away
and
leaving
their
villages
to
be
devastated
by
the
cossacks
the
peasants
in
the
steppe
region
round
bogu
chdrovo
were
it
was
rumored
in
touch
with
the
french
received
leaflets
from
them
that
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
did
not
migrate
.
he
learned
from
domestic
serfs
loyal
to
him
that
the
peasant
karp
who
possessed
great
influence
in
the
village
commune
and
had
re
cently
been
away
driving
a
government
trans
port
had
returned
with
news
that
the
cossacks
were
destroying
deserted
villages
but
that
the
french
did
not
harm
them
.
alpdtych
also
knew
that
on
the
previous
day
another
peasant
had
even
brought
from
the
village
of
visloukhovo
which
was
occupied
by
the
french
a
procla
mation
by
a
french
general
that
no
harm
would
be
done
to
the
inhabitants
and
if
they
remained
they
would
be
paid
for
anything
tak
en
from
them
.
as
proof
of
this
the
peasant
had
brought
from
visloukhovo
a
hundred
ru
bles
in
notes
he
did
not
know
that
they
were
false
paid
to
him
in
advance
for
hay
.
more
important
still
alpdtych
learned
that
on
the
morning
of
the
very
day
he
gave
the
vil
lage
elder
orders
to
collect
carts
to
move
the
princess
luggage
from
boguchdrovo
there
had
been
a
village
meeting
at
which
it
had
been
de
cided
not
to
move
but
to
wait
.
yet
there
was
ten
411
no
time
to
waste
.
on
the
fifteenth
the
day
of
the
old
princes
death
the
marshal
had
insisted
on
princess
marys
leaving
at
once
as
it
was
becoming
dangerous
.
he
had
told
her
that
aft
er
the
sixteenth
he
could
not
be
responsible
for
what
might
happen
.
on
the
evening
of
the
day
the
old
prince
died
the
marshal
went
away
promising
to
return
next
day
for
the
funeral
.
but
this
he
was
unable
to
do
for
he
received
tidings
that
the
french
had
unexpectedly
ad
vanced
and
had
barely
time
to
remove
his
own
family
and
valuables
from
his
estate
.
for
some
thirty
years
boguchdrovo
had
been
managed
by
the
village
elder
dron
whom
the
old
prince
called
by
the
diminutive
dr6nush
ka
.
dron
was
one
of
those
physically
and
men
tal
ly
vigorous
peasants
who
grow
big
beards
as
soon
as
they
are
of
age
and
go
on
unchanged
till
they
are
sixty
or
seventy
without
a
gray
hair
or
the
loss
of
a
tooth
as
straight
and
strong
at
sixty
as
at
thirty
.
soon
after
the
migration
to
the
warm
riv
ers
in
which
he
had
taken
part
like
the
rest
dron
was
made
village
elder
and
overseer
of
boguchdrovo
and
had
since
filled
that
post
ir
reproachably
for
twentythree
years
.
the
peas
ants
feared
him
more
than
they
did
their
mas
ter
.
the
masters
both
the
old
prince
and
the
young
and
the
steward
respected
him
and
jestingly
called
him
the
minister
.
during
the
whole
time
of
his
service
dron
had
never
been
drunk
or
ill
never
after
sleepless
nights
or
the
hardest
tasks
had
he
shown
the
least
fa
tigue
and
though
he
could
not
read
he
had
never
forgotten
a
single
money
account
or
the
number
of
quarters
of
flour
in
any
of
the
end
less
cartloads
he
sold
for
the
prince
nor
a
sin
gle
shock
of
the
whole
corn
crop
on
any
single
acre
of
the
boguchdrovo
fields
.
alpdtych
arriving
from
the
devastated
bald
hills
estate
sent
for
his
dron
on
the
day
of
the
princes
funeral
and
told
him
to
have
twelve
horses
got
ready
for
the
princess
car
riages
and
eighteen
carts
for
the
things
to
be
removed
from
boguchdrovo
.
though
the
peas
ants
paid
quitrent
alpdtych
thought
no
dif
ficulty
would
be
made
about
complying
with
this
order
for
there
were
two
hundred
and
thirty
households
at
work
in
boguchdrovo
and
the
peasants
were
well
to
do
.
but
on
hearing
the
order
dron
lowered
his
eyes
and
remained
silent
.
alpdtych
named
certain
peasants
he
knew
from
whom
he
told
him
to
take
the
carts
.
dron
replied
that
the
horses
of
these
peas
ants
were
away
carting
.
alpdtych
named
oth
412
war
and
peace
crs
but
they
too
according
to
dron
had
no
horses
available
some
horses
were
carting
for
the
government
others
were
too
weak
and
others
had
died
for
want
of
fodder
.
it
seemed
that
no
horses
could
be
had
even
for
the
car
riages
much
less
for
the
carting
.
alpdtych
looked
intently
at
dron
and
frowned
.
just
as
dron
was
a
model
village
eld
er
so
alpdtych
had
not
managed
the
princes
estates
for
twenty
years
in
vain
.
he
was
a
model
steward
possessing
in
the
highest
degree
the
faculty
of
divining
the
needs
and
instincts
of
those
he
dealt
with
.
having
glanced
at
dron
he
at
once
understood
that
his
answers
did
not
express
his
personal
views
but
the
general
mood
of
the
boguchdrovo
commune
by
which
the
elder
had
already
been
carried
away
.
but
he
also
knew
that
dron
who
had
acquired
property
and
was
hated
by
the
commune
must
be
hesitating
between
the
two
camps
the
mas
ters
and
the
serfs
.
he
noticed
this
hesitation
in
drons
look
and
therefore
frowned
and
moved
closer
up
to
him
.
now
just
listen
dr6nushka
said
he
.
dont
talk
nonsense
to
me
.
his
excellency
prince
andrew
himself
gave
me
orders
to
move
all
the
people
away
and
not
leave
them
with
the
enemy
and
there
is
an
order
from
the
tsar
about
it
too
.
anyone
who
stays
is
a
traitor
to
the
tsar
.
do
you
hear
i
hear
dron
answered
without
lifting
his
eyes
.
alpdtych
was
not
satisfied
with
this
reply
.
eh
dron
it
will
turn
out
badly
1
he
said
shaking
his
head
.
the
power
is
in
your
hands
dron
rejoined
sadly
.
eh
dron
drop
it
alpdtych
repeated
withdrawing
his
hand
from
his
bosom
and
sol
emnly
pointing
to
the
floor
at
drons
feet
.
i
can
see
through
you
and
three
yards
into
the
ground
under
you
he
continued
gazing
at
the
floor
in
front
of
dron
.
dron
was
disconcerted
glanced
furtively
at
alpdtych
and
again
lowered
his
eyes
.
you
drop
this
nonsense
and
tell
the
people
to
get
ready
to
leave
their
homes
and
go
to
moscow
and
to
get
carts
ready
for
tomorrow
morning
for
the
princess
things
.
and
dont
go
to
any
meeting
yourself
do
you
hear
dron
suddenly
fell
on
his
knees
.
ydkov
alpdtych
discharge
me
take
the
keys
from
me
and
discharge
me
for
christs
sake
stop
that
cried
alpdtych
sternly
.
i
see
through
you
and
three
yards
under
you
he
repeated
knowing
that
his
skill
in
beekeeping
his
knowledge
of
the
right
time
to
sow
the
oats
and
the
fact
that
he
had
been
able
to
retain
the
old
princes
favor
for
twenty
years
had
long
since
gained
him
the
reputation
of
being
a
wizard
and
that
the
power
of
seeing
three
yards
under
a
man
is
considered
an
attribute
of
wizards
.
dron
got
up
and
was
about
to
say
something
but
alpdtych
interrupted
him
.
what
is
it
you
have
got
into
your
heads
eh

.

.

.
what
are
you
thinking
of
eh
what
am
i
to
do
with
the
people
said
dron
.
theyre
quite
beside
themselves
i
have
already
told
them

.

.

.

told
them
i
dare
say
said
alpdtych
.
are
they
drinking
he
asked
abruptly
.
quite
beside
themselves
ydkov
alpdtych
theyve
fetched
another
barrel
.
well
then
listen
ill
go
to
the
police
of
ficer
and
you
tell
them
so
and
that
they
must
stop
this
and
the
carts
must
be
got
ready
.
i
understand
.
alpdtych
did
not
insist
further
.
he
had
man
aged
people
for
a
long
time
and
knew
that
the
chief
way
to
make
them
obey
is
to
show
no
sus
picion
that
they
can
possibly
disobey
.
having
wrung
a
submissive
i
understand
from
dron
alpatych
contented
himself
with
that
though
he
not
only
doubted
but
felt
almost
certain
that
without
the
help
of
troops
the
carts
would
not
be
forthcoming
.
and
so
it
was
for
when
evening
came
no
carts
had
been
provided
.
in
the
village
out
side
the
drink
shop
another
meeting
was
be
ing
held
which
decided
that
the
horses
should
be
driven
out
into
the
woods
and
the
carts
should
not
be
provided
.
without
saying
any
thing
of
this
to
the
princess
alpdtych
had
his
own
belongings
taken
out
of
the
carts
which
had
arrived
from
bald
hills
and
had
those
horses
got
ready
for
the
princess
carriages
.
meanwhile
he
went
himself
to
the
police
au
thorities
.
chapter
x
after
her
fathers
funeral
princess
mary
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
and
did
not
admit
anyone
.
a
maid
came
to
the
door
to
say
that
alpdtych
was
asking
for
orders
about
their
de
parture
.
this
was
before
his
talk
with
dron
.
princess
mary
raised
herself
on
the
sofa
on
which
she
had
been
lying
and
replied
through
the
closed
door
that
she
did
not
mean
to
go
away
and
begged
to
be
left
in
peace
.
the
windows
of
the
room
in
which
she
was
book
ten
43
lying
looked
westward
.
she
lay
on
the
sofa
with
her
face
to
the
wall
fingering
the
buttons
of
the
leather
cushion
and
seeing
nothing
but
that
cushion
and
her
confused
thoughts
were
centered
on
one
subject
the
irrevocability
of
death
and
her
own
spiritual
baseness
which
she
had
not
suspected
but
which
had
shown
itself
during
her
fathers
illness
.
she
wished
to
pray
but
did
not
dare
to
dared
not
in
her
present
state
of
mind
address
herself
to
god
.
she
lay
for
a
long
time
in
that
position
.
the
sun
had
reached
the
other
side
of
the
house
and
its
slanting
rays
shone
into
theopen
window
lighting
up
the
room
and
part
of
the
morocco
cushion
at
which
princess
mary
was
looking
.
the
flow
of
her
thoughts
suddenly
stopped
.
unconsciously
she
sat
up
smoothed
her
hair
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
in
voluntarily
inhaling
the
freshness
of
the
clear
but
windy
evening
.
yes
you
can
well
enjoy
the
evening
now
he
is
gone
and
no
one
will
hinder
you
she
said
to
herself
and
sinking
into
a
chair
she
let
her
head
fall
on
the
window
sill
.
someone
spoke
her
name
in
a
soft
and
ten
der
voice
from
the
garden
and
kissed
her
head
.
she
looked
up
.
it
was
mademoiselle
bouri
enne
in
a
black
dress
and
weepers
.
she
softly
approached
princess
mary
sighed
kissed
her
and
immediately
began
to
cry
.
the
princess
looked
up
at
her
.
all
their
former
disharmony
and
her
own
jealousy
recurred
to
her
mind
.
but
she
remembered
too
how
he
had
changed
of
late
toward
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
could
not
bear
to
see
her
thereby
showing
how
unjust
were
the
reproaches
princess
mary
had
mentally
addressed
to
her
.
besides
is
it
for
me
for
me
who
desired
his
death
to
condemn
anyone
she
thought
.
princess
mary
vividly
pictured
to
herself
the
position
of
mademoiselle
bourienne
whom
she
had
of
late
kept
at
a
distance
but
who
yet
was
dependent
on
her
and
living
in
her
house
.
she
felt
sorry
for
her
and
held
out
her
hand
with
a
glance
of
gentle
inquiry
.
mademoiselle
bourienne
at
once
began
crying
again
and
kissed
that
hand
speaking
of
the
princess
sor
row
and
making
herself
a
partner
in
it
.
she
said
her
only
consolation
was
the
fact
that
the
princess
allowed
her
to
share
her
sorrow
that
all
the
old
misunderstandings
should
sink
into
nothing
but
this
great
grief
that
she
felt
her
self
blameless
in
regard
to
everyone
and
that
he
from
above
saw
her
affection
and
grati
tude
.
the
princess
heard
her
not
heeding
her
words
but
occasionally
looking
up
at
her
and
listening
to
the
sound
of
her
voice
.
your
position
is
doubly
terrible
dear
prin
cess
said
mademoiselle
bourienne
after
a
pause
.
i
understand
that
you
could
not
and
cannot
think
of
yourself
but
with
my
love
for
you
i
must
do
so
.

..
.
has
alpdtych
been
to
you
has
he
spoken
to
you
of
going
away
she
asked
.
princess
mary
did
not
answer
.
she
did
not
understand
who
was
to
go
or
where
to
.
is
it
possible
to
plan
or
think
of
anything
now
is
it
not
all
the
same
she
thought
and
did
not
reply
.
you
know
chere
marie
said
mademoi
selle
bourienne
that
we
are
in
danger
are
surrounded
by
the
french
.
it
would
be
danger
ous
to
move
now
.
if
we
go
we
are
almost
sure
to
be
taken
prisoners
and
god
knows

.

.

.
princess
mary
looked
at
her
companion
with
out
understanding
what
she
was
talking
about
.
oh
if
anyone
knew
how
little
anything
matters
to
me
now
she
said
.
of
course
i
would
on
no
account
wish
to
go
away
from
him
.

.

.

.
alpdtych
did
say
something
about
go
ing
.

.

.

.
speak
to
him
i
can
do
nothing
noth
ing
and
dont
want
to
.

.

.

.
ive
spoken
to
him
.
he
hopes
we
should
be
in
time
to
get
away
tomorrow
but
i
think
it
would
now
be
better
to
stay
here
said
made
moiselle
bourienne
.
because
you
will
agree
chere
marie
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
sol
diers
or
of
riotous
peasants
would
be
terrible
.
mademoiselle
bourienne
took
from
her
reticule
a
proclamation
not
printed
on
ordi
nary
russian
paper
of
general
rameaus
tell
ing
people
not
to
leave
their
homes
and
that
the
french
authorities
would
afford
them
prop
er
protection
.
she
handed
this
to
the
princess
.
i
think
it
would
be
best
to
appeal
to
that
general
she
continued
and
i
am
sure
that
all
due
respect
would
be
shown
you
.
princess
mary
read
the
paper
and
her
face
began
to
quiver
with
stifled
sobs
.
from
whom
did
you
get
this
she
asked
.
they
probably
recognized
that
i
am
french
by
my
name
replied
mademoiselle
bouri
enne
blushing
.
princess
mary
with
the
paper
in
her
hand
rose
from
the
window
and
with
a
pale
face
went
out
of
the
room
and
into
what
had
been
prince
andrews
study
.

said
and

added
hearing
mademoiselle
bouriennes
voice
.
we
must
go
at
once
at
once
she
said
appalled
at
414
war
and
peace
the
thought
of
being
left
in
the
hands
of
the
french
.
if
prince
andrew
heard
that
i
was
in
the
power
of
the
french
that
i
the
daughter
of
prince
nicholas
bolk6nski
asked
general
ra
meau
for
protection
and
accepted
his
favorl
this
idea
horrified
her
made
her
shudder
blush
and
feel
sudi
a
rush
of
anger
and
pride
as
she
had
never
experienced
before
.
all
that
was
distressing
and
especially
all
that
was
hu
miliating
in
her
position
rose
vividly
to
her
mind
.
they
the
french
would
settle
in
this
house
m
.
le
general
rameau
would
occupy
prince
andrews
study
and
amuse
himself
by
looking
through
and
reading
his
letters
and
papers
.
mademoiselle
bourienne
would
do
the
honors
of
boguchdrovo
for
him

i
should
be
given
a

sorrow

.
thought
princess
mary
not
thinking
her
own
thoughts
but
feeling
bound
to
think
like
her
father
and
her
brother
.
for
herself
she
did
not
care
where
she
remained
or
what
happened
to
her
but
she
felt
herself
the
representative
of
her
dead
father
and
of
prince
andrew
.
invol
untarily
she
thought
their
thoughts
and
felt
their
feelings
.
what
they
would
have
said
and
what
they
would
have
done
she
felt
bound
to
say
and
do
.
she
went
into
prince
andrews
study
trying
to
enter
completely
into
his
ideas
and
considered
her
position
.
the
demands
of
life
which
had
seemed
to
her
annihilated
by
her
fathers
death
all
at
once
rose
before
her
with
a
new
previously
un
known
force
and
took
possession
of
her
.
agitated
and
flushed
she
paced
the
room
sending
now
for
michael
ivanovich
and
now
for
tikhon
or
dron
.
dunydsha
the
nurse
and
the
other
maids
could
not
say
in
how
far
made
moiselle
bouriennes
statement
was
correct
.
alpdtych
was
riot
at
home
he
had
gone
to
the
police
.
neither
could
the
architect
michael
ivanovich
who
on
being
sent
for
came
in
with
sleepy
eyes
tell
princess
mary
anything
.
with
just
the
same
smile
of
agreement
with
which
for
fifteen
years
he
had
been
accustomed
to
answer
the
old
prince
without
expressing
views
of
his
own
he
now
replied
to
princess
mary
so
that
nothing
definite
could
be
got
from
his
answers
.
the
old
valet
tikhon
with
sunken
emaciated
face
that
bore
the
stamp
of
incon
solable
grief
replied
yes
princess
to
all
princess
marys
questions
and
hardly
refrained
from
sobbing
as
he
looked
at
her
.
at
length
dron
the
village
elder
entered
the
room
and
with
a
deep
bow
to
princess
mary
came
to
a
halt
by
the
doorpost
.
princess
mary
walked
up
and
down
the
room
and
stopped
in
front
of
him
.
dr6nushka
she
said
regarding
as
a
sure
friend
this
dr6nushka
who
always
used
to
bring
a
special
kind
of
gingerbread
from
his
visit
to
the
fair
at
vyazma
every
year
and
smil
ingly
offer
it
to
her
dr6nushka
now
since
our
misfortune

.

.

.
she
began
but
could
not
go
on
.
we
are
all
in
gods
hands
said
he
with
a
sigh
.
they
were
silent
for
a
while
.
dronushka
alpdtych
has
gone
off
some
where
and
i
have
no
one
to
turn
to
.
is
it
true
as
they
tell
me
that
i
cant
even
go
away
why
shouldnt
you
go
away
your
excel
lency

said
dron
.
i
was
told
it
would
be
dangerous
because
of
the
enemy
.
dear
friend
i
can
do
nothing
.
i
understand
nothing
.
i
have
nobody
i
i
want
to
go
away
tonight
or
early
tomorrow
morning
.
dron
paused
.
he
looked
askance
at
princess
mary
and
said
there
are
no
horses
i
told
ydkov
alpdtych
so
.
why
are
there
none
asked
the
princess
.
its
all
gods
scourge
said
dron
.
what
horses
we
had
have
been
taken
for
the
army
or
have
died
this
is
such
a
year
its
not
a
case
of
feeding
horses
we
may
die
of
hunger
ourselves
1
as
it
is
some
go
three
days
without
eating
.
weve
nothing
weve
been
ruined
.
princess
mary
listened
attentively
to
what
he
told
her
.
the
peasants
are
ruined
they
have
no
bread
she
asked
.
theyre
dying
of
hunger
said
dron
.
its
not
a
case
of
carting
.
but
why
didnt
you
tell
me
dr6nushka
isnt
it
possible
to
help
them
ill
do
all
i
can
.

.

.

.
to
princess
mary
it
was
strange
that
now
at
a
moment
when
such
sorrow
was
filling
her
soul
there
could
be
rich
people
and
poor
and
the
rich
could
refrain
from
helping
the
poor
.
she
had
heard
vaguely
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
landlords
corn
which
was
some
times
given
to
the
peasants
.
she
also
knew
that
neither
her
father
nor
her
brother
would
re
fuse
to
help
the
peasants
in
need
she
only
feared
to
make
some
mistake
in
speaking
about
the
distribution
of
the
grain
she
wished
to
give
.
she
was
glad
such
cares
presented
them
book
ten
415
selves
enabling
her
without
scruple
to
forget
her
own
grief
.
she
began
asking
dron
about
the
peasants
needs
and
what
there
was
in
boguchdrovo
that
belonged
to
the
landlord
.
but
we
have
grain
belonging
to
my
broth
er
she
said
.
the
landlords
grain
is
all
safe
replied
dron
proudly
.
our
prince
did
not
order
it
to
be
sold
.
give
it
to
the
peasants
let
them
have
all
they
need
i
give
you
leave
in
my
brothers
name
said
she
.
dron
made
no
answer
but
sighed
deeply
.
give
them
that
corn
if
there
is
enough
of
it
.
distribute
it
all
.
i
give
this
order
in
my
brothers
name
and
tell
them
that
what
is
ours
is
theirs
.
we
do
not
grudge
them
anything
.
tell
them
so
.
dron
looked
intently
at
the
princess
while
she
was
speaking
.
discharge
me
little
mother
for
gods
sakel
order
the
keys
to
be
taken
from
me
said
he
.
i
have
served
twentythree
years
and
have
done
no
wrong
.
discharge
me
for
gods
sake
princess
mary
did
not
understand
what
he
wanted
of
her
or
why
he
was
asking
to
be
dis
charged
.
she
replied
that
she
had
never
doubt
ed
his
devotion
and
that
she
was
ready
to
do
anything
for
him
and
for
the
peasants
.
chapter
xi
an
hour
later
dunydsha
came
to
tell
the
prin
cess
that
dron
had
come
and
all
the
peasants
had
assembled
at
the
barn
by
the
princess
or
der
and
wished
to
have
word
with
their
mis
tress
.
but
i
never
told
them
to
come
said
prin
cess
mary
.
i
only
told
dron
to
let
them
have
the
grain
.
only
for
gods
sake
princess
dear
have
them
sent
away
and
dont
go
out
to
them
.
its
all
a
trick
said
dunydsha
and
when
yakov
alpdtych
returns
let
us
get
away

.

.

.
and
please
dont

.

.

.
what
is
a
trick
asked
princess
mary
in
surprise
.
i
know
it
is
only
listen
to
me
for
gods
sake
ask
nurse
too
.
they
say
they
dont
agree
to
leave
bogucharovo
as
you
ordered
.
youre
making
some
mistake
.
i
never
or
dered
them
to
go
away
said
princess
mary
.
call
drdnushka
.
dron
came
and
confirmed
dunydshas
words
the
peasants
had
come
by
the
princess
order
.
but
i
never
sent
for
them
declared
the
princess
.
you
must
have
given
my
message
wrong
.
i
only
said
that
you
were
to
give
them
the
grain
.
dron
only
sighed
in
reply
.
if
you
order
it
they
will
go
away
said
he
.
no
no
.
ill
go
out
to
them
said
princess
mary
and
in
spite
of
the
nurses
and
dunyd
shas
protests
she
went
out
into
the
porch
dron
dunydsha
the
nurse
and
michael
ivdn
ovich
following
her
.
they
probably
think
i
am
offering
them
the
grain
to
bribe
them
to
remain
here
while
i
myself
go
away
leaving
them
to
the
mercy
of
the
french
thought
princess
mary
.
i
will
offer
them
monthly
rations
and
housing
at
our
moscow
estate
.
i
am
sure
andrew
would
do
even
more
in
rny
place
she
thought
as
she
went
out
in
the
twilight
toward
the
crowd
standing
on
the
pasture
by
the
barn
.
the
men
crowded
closer
together
stirred
and
rapidly
took
off
their
hats
.
princess
mary
lowered
her
eyes
and
tripping
over
her
skirt
came
close
up
to
them
.
so
many
different
eyes
old
and
young
were
fixed
on
her
and
there
were
so
many
different
faces
that
she
could
not
distinguish
any
of
them
and
feeling
that
she
must
speak
to
them
all
at
once
did
not
know
how
to
do
it
.
but
again
the
sense
that
she
represented
her
father
and
her
brother
gave
her
courage
and
she
boldly
began
her
speech
.
i
am
very
glad
you
have
come
she
said
without
raising
her
eyes
and
feeling
her
heart
beating
quickly
and
violently
.
dronushka
tells
me
that
the
war
has
ruined
you
.
that
is
our
common
misfortune
and
i
shall
grudge
nothing
to
help
you
.
i
am
myself
going
away
because
it
is
dangerous
here

.

.

.
the
enemy
is
near

.

.

.
because

..
.
i
am
giving
you
every
thing
my
friends
and
i
beg
you
to
take
every
thing
all
our
grain
so
that
you
may
not
suffer
want
and
if
you
have
been
told
that
i
am
giv
ing
you
the
grain
to
keep
you
here
that
is
not
true
.
on
the
contrary
i
ask
you
to
go
with
all
your
belongings
to
our
estate
near
moscow
and
i
promise
you
i
will
see
to
it
that
there
you
shall
want
for
nothing
.
you
shall
be
given
food
and
lodging
.
the
princess
stopped
.
sighs
were
the
only
sound
heard
in
the
crowd
.
i
am
not
doing
this
on
my
own
account
she
continued
i
do
it
in
the
name
of
my
dead
father
who
was
a
good
master
to
you
and
of
my
brother
and
his
son
.
again
she
paused
.
no
one
broke
the
silence
.
ours
is
a
common
misfortune
and
we
will
share
it
together
.
all
that
is
mine
is
yours
she
concluded
scanning
the
faces
before
her
.
416
all
eyes
were
gazing
at
her
with
one
and
the
same
expression
.
she
could
not
fathom
wheth
er
it
was
curiosity
devotion
gratitude
or
ap
prehension
and
distrust
but
the
expression
on
all
the
faces
was
identical
.
we
are
all
very
thankful
for
your
bounty
but
it
wont
do
for
us
to
take
the
landlords
grain
said
a
voice
at
the
back
of
the
crowd
.
but
why
not
asked
the
princess
.
no
one
replied
and
princess
mary
looking
round
at
the
crowd
found
that
every
eye
she
met
now
was
immediately
dropped
.
but
why
dont
you
want
to
take
it
she
asked
again
.
no
one
answered
.
the
silence
began
to
oppress
the
princess
and
she
tried
to
catch
someones
eye
.
why
dont
you
speak
she
inquired
of
a
very
old
man
who
stood
just
in
front
of
her
leaning
on
his
stick
.
if
you
think
something
more
is
wanted
tell
mel
i
will
do
anything
said
she
catching
his
eye
.
but
as
if
this
angered
him
he
bent
his
head
quite
low
and
muttered
why
should
we
agree
we
dont
want
the
grain
.
why
should
we
give
up
everything
we
dont
agree
.
dont
agree
.

.

.

.
we
are
sorry
for
you
but
were
not
willing
.
go
away
yourself
alone

.

.

.
came
from
various
sides
of
the
crowd
.
and
again
all
the
faces
in
that
crowd
bore
an
identical
expression
though
now
it
was
certainly
not
an
expression
of
curiosity
or
grati
tude
but
of
angry
resolve
.
but
you
cant
have
understood
me
said
princess
mary
with
a
sad
smile
.
why
dont
you
want
to
go
i
promise
to
house
and
feed
you
while
here
the
enemy
would
ruin
you

but
her
voice
was
drowned
by
the
voices
of
the
crowd
.
were
not
willing
.
let
them
ruin
us
we
wont
take
your
grain
.
we
dont
agree
.
again
princess
mary
tried
to
catch
some
ones
eye
but
not
a
single
eye
in
the
crowd
was
turned
to
her
evidently
they
were
all
trying
to
avoid
her
look
.
she
felt
strange
and
awkward
.
oh
yes
an
artful
tale
follow
her
into
slavery
pull
down
your
houses
and
go
into
bondage
i
dare
say
til
give
you
grain
in
deed
she
says
voices
in
the
crowd
were
heard
saying
.
with
drooping
head
princess
mary
left
the
crowd
and
went
back
to
the
house
.
having
re
peated
her
order
to
dron
to
have
horses
ready
for
her
departure
next
morning
she
went
to
war
and
peace
her
room
and
remained
alone
with
her
own
thoughts
.
chapter
xii
for
a
long
time
that
night
princess
mary
sat
by
the
open
window
of
her
room
hearing
the
sound
of
the
peasants
voices
that
reached
her
from
the
village
but
it
was
not
of
them
she
was
thinking
.
she
felt
that
she
could
not
under
stand
them
however
much
she
might
think
about
them
.
she
thought
only
of
one
thing
her
sorrow
which
after
the
break
caused
by
cares
for
the
present
seemed
already
to
be
long
to
the
past
.
now
she
could
remember
it
and
weep
or
pray
.
after
sunset
the
wind
had
dropped
.
the
night
was
calm
and
fresh
.
toward
midnight
the
voices
began
to
subside
a
cock
crowed
the
full
moon
began
to
show
from
behind
the
lime
trees
a
fresh
white
dewy
mist
began
to
rise
and
stillness
reigned
over
the
village
and
the
house
.
pictures
of
the
near
past
her
fathers
illness
and
last
moments
rose
one
after
another
to
her
memory
.
with
mournful
pleasure
she
now
lingered
over
these
images
repelling
with
hor
ror
only
the
last
one
the
picture
of
his
death
which
she
felt
she
could
not
contemplate
even
in
imagination
at
this
still
and
mystic
hour
of
night
.
and
these
pictures
presented
themselves
to
her
so
clearly
and
in
such
detail
that
they
seemed
now
present
now
past
and
now
fu
ture
.
she
vividly
recalled
the
moment
when
he
had
his
first
stroke
and
was
being
dragged
along
by
his
armpits
through
the
garden
at
bald
hills
muttering
something
with
his
help
less
tongue
twitching
his
gray
eyebrows
and
looking
uneasily
and
timidly
at
her
.
even
then
he
wanted
to
tell
me
what
he
told
me
the
day
he
died
she
thought
.
he
had
always
thought
what
he
said
then
.
and
she
re
called
in
all
its
detail
the
night
at
bald
hills
before
he
had
the
last
stroke
when
with
a
fore
boding
of
disaster
she
had
remained
at
home
against
his
will
.
she
had
not
slept
and
had
stolen
downstairs
on
tiptoe
and
going
to
the
door
of
the
conservatory
where
he
slept
that
night
had
listened
at
the
door
.
in
a
suffering
and
weary
voice
he
was
saying
something
to
tikhon
speaking
of
the
crimea
and
its
warm
nights
and
of
the
empress
.
evidently
he
had
wanted
to
talk
.
and
why
didnt
he
call
me
why
didnt
he
let
me
be
there
instead
of

now
he
will
never
tell
anyone
what
he
had
in
his
soul
.
never
will
that
mo
ment
return
for
him
or
for
me
when
he
might
have
said
all
he
longed
to
say
and
not
tikhon
but
i
might
have
heard
and
understood
him
.
why
didnt
i
enter
the
room
she
thought
.
perhaps
he
would
then
have
said
to
me
what
he
said
the
day
he
died
.
while
talking
to
tik
hon
he
asked
about
me
twice
.
he
wanted
to
see
me
and
i
was
standing
close
by
outside
the
door
.
it
was
sad
and
painful
for
him
to
talk
to
tikhon
who
did
not
understand
him
.
i
re
member
how
he
began
speaking
to
him
about
lise
as
if
she
were
alive
he
had
forgotten
she
was
dead
and
tikhon
reminded
him
that
she
was
no
more
and
he
shouted

he
was
greatly
depressed
.
from
behind
the
door
i
heard
how
he
lay
down
on
his
bed
groaning
and
loudly
exclaimed
my
god
why
didnt
i
go
in
then
what
could
he
have
done
to
me
what
could
i
have
lost
and
perhaps
he
would
then
have
been
comforted
and
would
have
said

word
to

and
began
sobbing
with
tears
that
re

her
soul
.
she
now
saw
his
face
before
her
.
and
not
the
face
she
had
known
ever
since
she
coujp
remember
and
had
always
seen
at
a
distance
but
the
timid
feeble
face
she
had
seen
for
the
first
time
quite
closely
with
all
its
wrinkles
and
details
when
she
stooped
near
to
his

to

repeated

now
this

suddenly
presented
itself
to
her
and
in
answer
she
saw
him
before
her
with
the
expres

that
was
on
his
face
as
he
lay
in
his
coffin
with
his
chin
bound
up
with
a
white
handker

.
and
the
horror
that
had
seized
her
when
she
touched
him
and
convinced
herself
that
that
was
not
he
but
something
mysterious
and
horrible
seized
her
again
.
she
tried
to
think
of
something
else
and
to

but

with
wideopen
eyes
she
gazed
at
the
moonlight
and
the
shadows
expecting
every
moment
to
see
his
dead
face
and
she
felt
that
the
silence
brooding
over
the
house
and
with
in
it
held
her
fast
.

whispered

she
screamed
wildly
and
tearing
herself
out
of
this
silence
she
ran
to

nurse
and
the

who
came

returned
from

by

at

ten
miles
from

went
for

ride
to
try

new
horse

bought
and
to
find
out
whether
there
was
any
hay
to
be
had
in
the
villages
.
for
the
last
three
days
boguchdrovo
had
lain
between
the
two
hostile
armies
so
that
it
was
as
easy
for

to
get

rostov
and
ilyin
were
in
the
merriest
of
moods

on
the

to
bogucmrovo
a
princely
estate
with
a

where
they
hoped
to
find
many
domestic
serfs
and
pretty
girls
they
questioned
lavrushka
about
napoleon
and
laughed
at
his
stories
and
raced
one
another
to
try
ilyfns

.
rost6v
had
no
idea
that
the

was
entering
was
the
property
of

they
rode
at
a
footpace
to
the
barn
where
a
large
crowd
of
peasants
was
standing
.
some
of
the
men
bared
their
heads
others
stared
at
the
new
arrivals
without
doffing
their
caps
.
two
tall
old
peasantswith
wrinkled
faces
and
scanty
beards
emerged
from
the
tavern
smiling
staggering
and
singing
some
incoher
ent
song
and
approached
the
officers

out

went
up
to

another

coming
up

he
added
.

the

have
met
to

over

replied
the
peasant
moving
away
.
at
that
moment
on
the
road
leading
from
the
big
house
two
women
and
a
man
in
a
white
hat
were
seen
coming
toward
the
officers

the

following
dunydsha
alpatych
advanced
to
rost6v
having
bared
his
head
while
still
at
a
distance
.
may

said
he
respectfully
but
with
a
shade
of
con
tempt
for
the
youthfulness
of
this

and
with

thrust
into

at
the

and
smiled
.
or
perhaps
they

he
pointed
at
the
old

with
his

.
no

at

said
rostov
and
rode
on
a
little
way
.
whats
the
matter
he
asked
.
i
make
bold
to
inform
your
honor
that
the
rude
peasants
here
dont
wish
to
let
the
mis
tress
leave
the

and
threaten
to
unharness

horses
so
that
though
everything
has
been
packed
up

her
excellency
can
not

exclaimed
rost6v
.
i
have
the
honor
to
report
to
you
the
actual
truth
said
alpdtych
.
rost6v
dismounted
gave
his
horse
to
the
or
derly
and
followed
alpatych
to
the
house
questioning
him
as
to
the
state
of
affairs
.
it
ap
peared
that
the
princess
offer
of
corn
to
the
peasants
the
previous
day
and
her
talk
with
dron
and
at
the
meeting
had
actually
had
so
bad
an
effect
that
dron
had
finally
given
up
the
keys
and
joined
the
peasants
and
had
not
appeared
when
alpdtych
sent
for
him
and
that
in
the
morning
when
the
princess
gave
or
ders
to
harness
for
her
journey
the
peasants
had
come
in
a
large
crowd
to
the
barn
and
sent
word
that
they
would
not
let
her
leave
the
vil
lage
that
there
was
an
order
not
to
move
and
that
they
would
unharness
the
horses
.
alpdtych
had
gone
out
to
admonish
them
but
was
told
it
was
chiefly
karp
who
did
the
talking
dron
not
showing
himself
in
the
crowd
that
they
could
not
let
the
princess
go
that
there
was
an
order
to
the
contrary
but
that
if
she
stayed
they
would
serve
her
as
before
and
obey
her
in
everything
.
at
the
moment
when
rost6v
and
ilyfn
were
galloping
along
the
road
princess
mary
de
spite
the
dissuasions
of
alpatych
her
nurse
and
the
maids
had
given
orders
to
harness
and
in
tended
to
start
but
when
the
cavalrymen
were
espied
they
were
taken
for
frenchmen
the
coachman
ran
away
and
the
women
in
the
house
began
to
wail

princess

was
sitting
helpless
and
be
wildered
in
the
large
sitting
room
when
ros

was
shown
in
.
she
could
not
grasp
who
he
was
and
why
he
had
come
or
what
was

ing
to
her
.
when
she
saw
his
russian
face
and
by
his
walk
and
the
first
words
he
uttered
rec
ognized
him
as
a
man
of

she
glanced
at
him
with
her
deep
radiant
look
and
began
speaking
in
a
voice
that
faltered
and
trembled
with
emotion
.
this
meeting
imme
diately
struck
rost6v
as
a
romantic
event
.
a
helpless
girl
overwhelmed
with

to
the
mercy
of

thought
he
as
he
looked
at
her
and
lis
tened
to
her
timid
story
.
when
she
began
to
tell
him
that
all
this
had
happened
the
day
after
her
fathers
funeral
her
voiced
trembled
.
she
turned
away
and
then
as
if
fearing
he
might
take
her
words
as
meant
to
move
him
to
pity
looked
at
him
with
an
ap
prehensive
glance
of
inquiry
.
there
were
tears
in
rost6vs
eyes
.
princess
mary
noticed
this
and
glanced
gratefully
at
him
with
that
radiant
look
which
caused
the
plainness
of
her
face
to
be
forgotten
.
i
cannot
express
princess
how
glad
i
am
that
i
happened
to
ride
here
and
am
able

show
my

i
give
you
my
word

that
no

shall
dare
to
cause
you
annoyance
if
only
you
will
allow
me
to
act
as
your

.
and
bowing
respectfully
as
if
to
a
lady
of
royal
blood
he
moved
toward
the
door
.
rost6vs
deferential
tone
seemed
to
indicate
that
though
he
would
consider
himself
happy
to
be
acquainted
with
her
he
did
not
wish
to
take
advantage
of
her
misfortunes
to
intrude
upon
her
.

understood
this
and
appreci

his

i
am

you
she
said
in

i

it
was
all
a

and
that
no

is
to

for
it

she

began
to

said

rost6v
knitting
his
brows
left
the

with
another

bow

on
glancing
at

ilyin
stopped
short
.
he
saw
that
his
hero
and
com
mander
was
following
quite
a
different
train
of
thought
.
rostov
glanced
angrily
at
ilyf

and
without

strode
off
with
rapid
steps

.and
as
if
afraid
of
wasting
his
store
of
anger
he
left
alpltych
and
went
rapidly
forward
.
alpdtych
mastering
his
of
fended
feelings
kept
pace
with
rost6v
at
a
gliding
gait
and
continued
to
impart
his
views
.
he
said
the
peasants
were
obdurate
and
that
at
the
present
moment
it
would
be
imprudent
to
overresist
them
without
an
armed
force
and
would
it
not
be
better

ill

.

.
ill
overresist
them
uttered
rost6v
meaninglessly
breath
less
with
irrational
animal
fury
and
the
need
to
vent
it
.
without
considering
what
he
would
do
he
moved
unconsciously
with
quick
resolute
steps
toward
the
crowd
.
and
the
nearer
he
drew
to
it
the
more
alpdtych
felt
that
this
unreason
able
action
might
produce
good
results
.
the
peasants
in
the
crowd
were
similarly
impressed
when
they
saw
rostovs
rapid
firm
steps
and
resolute
frowning
face
.
after
the
hussars
had
come
to
the
village
and
rostov
had
gone
to
see
the
princess
a
certain
confusion
and
dissension
had
arisen
among
the
crowd
.
some
of
the
peasants
said
that
these
new
arrivals
were
russians
and
might
take
it
amiss
that
the
mistress
was
beingdetained
.
dron
was
of
this
opinion
but
as
soon
as
he
expressed
it
karp
and
others
attacked
their
exelder
.

before

to

of

the

obediently
came
out
of

and
began
taking
off

the

demanded

and

shouted
rost6v
as

in

two

the

a

iool
two
hours
later
the
carts
were
standing
in
the

of

the

oneof

a

with

from

remarked
the
tall

peasant
gravely
pointing
with
a
significant
wink
at
the
diction

that
were
on
the
top
.
unwilling
to

himself
on
the
prin
cess
rost6v
did
not
go
back
to
the
house
but
remained
in
the
village
awaiting
her
depar
ture
.
when
her
carriage
drove
out
of
the
house
he
mounted
and
accompanied
her
eight
miles
from
boguchdrovo
to
where
the
road
was
occu
pied
by
our
troops
.
at
the
inn
at
yank6vo
he
respectfully
took
leave
of
her
for
the
first
time
permitting
himself
to
kiss
her
hand
.
how
can
you
speak
so
he
blushingly
re
plied
to
princess
marys
expressions
of
grati
tude
for
her
deliverance
as
she
termed
what
had
occurred
.
any
police
officer
would
have
done
as
much
if
we
had
had
only
peasants
to
fight
we
should
not
have
let
the
enemy
come
so
far
said
he
with
a
sense
of
shame
and
wish
ing
to
change
the
subject
.
i
am
only
happy
to
have
had
the
opportunity

want
to
make
me
blush
please
dont
thank
me
but
the
princess
if
she
did
not
again
thank
him
in
words
thanked
him
with
the
whole
ex
pression
of
her
face
radiant
with
gratitude
and
tenderness
.
she
could
not
believe
that
there
was
nothing
to
thank
him
for
.
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
to
her
certain
that
had
he
not
been
there
she
would
have
perished
at
the
hands
of
the
mutineers
and
of
the
french
and
that
he
had
exposed
himself
to
terrible
and
obvious
danger
to
save
her
and
even
more
certain
was
it
that
he
was
a
man
of
lofty
and
noble
soul
able
to
understand
her
position
and
her
sor
row
.
his
kind
honest
eyes
with
the
tears
ris
ing
in
them
when
she
herself
had
begun
to
cry
as
she
spoke
of
her
loss
did
not
leave
her
mem
ory
.
when
she
had
taken
leave
of
him
and
re
mained
alone
she
suddenly
felt
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
and
then
not
for
the
first
time
the
strange
question
presented
itself
to
her
did
she
love
him
on
the
rest
of
the
way
to
moscow
though
the
princess
position
was
not
a
cheerful
one
dunyasha
who
went
with
her
in
the
carriage
more
than
once
noticed
that
her
mistress
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
smiled
at
something
with
an
expression
of
mingled
joy
and
sorrow
.

as
she
was
of
acknowledging
to
her
self
that
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
man
who
would
perhaps
never
love
her
she
comforted
herself
with
the
thought
that
no
one
would
ever
know
it
and
that
she
would
not
be
to
blame
if
without
ever
speaking
of
it
to
any
one
she
continued
to
the
end
of
her
life
to
love
the
man
with
whom
she
had
fallen
in
love
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
her
life
.
sometimes
when
she
recalled
his
looks
his
sympathy
and
his
words
happiness
did
not
appear
impossible
to
her
.
it
was
at
those
mo
ments
that
dunyasha
noticed
her
smiling
as
she
looked
out
of
the

was
it

that

the
impression
the

made
on

was
a
very
agreeable
one
.
to
remember

gave
him
pleasure

grew
angry

it
made
him
angry
just
because
the
idea
of
marrying
the
gentle
princess
mary
who
was
attractive
to
him
and
had
an
enormous

had
against

chapter
xv
on
receiving
command
of
the
armies
kutiizov
remembered
prince
andrew
and
sent
an
order
for
him
to
report
at
headquarters
.
prince
andrew
arrived
at
tsdrevozaymish
che
on
the
very
day
and
at
the
very
hour
that
kutuzov
was
reviewing
the
troops
for
the
first
time
.
he
stopped
in
the
village
at
the
priests
house
in
front
of
which
stood
the
commander
in
chiefs
carriage
and
he
sat
down
on
the
bench
at
the
gate
awaiting
his
serene
high
ness
as
everyone
now
called
kutuzov
from
the
field
beyond
the
village
came
now
sounds
of
regimental
music
and
now
the
roar
of
many
voices
shouting
hurrah
to
the
new
com
mander
in
chief
.
two
orderlies
a
courier
and
a
majordomo
stood
near
by
some
ten
paces
from
prince
andrew
availing
themselves
of
kutiizovs
absence
and
of
the
fine
weather
.
a
short
swarthy
lieutenant
colonel
of
hussars
with
thick
mustaches
and
whiskers
rode
up
to
the
gate
and
glancing
at
prince
andrew
in
quired
whether
his
serene
highness
was
put
ting
up
there
and
whether
he
would
soon
be
back
.
prince
andrew
replied
that
he
was
not
on
his
serene
highness
staff
but
was
himself
a
new
arrival
.
the
lieutenant
colonel
turned
to
a
smart
orderly
who
with
the
peculiar
contempt
with
which
a
commander
in
chiefs
orderly
speaks
to
officers
replied
what
his
serene
highness
i
expect
hell

here
soon
.

the
lieutenant
colonel
of
hussars
smiled
be

the
orderlys
tone
dis
mounted
gave
his
horse
to
a
dispatch
runner
and
approached
bolk6nski
with
a
slight
bow
.
bolk6nski
made
room
for
him
on
the
bench
and
the
lieutenant
colonel
sat
down
beside
him

pressing

and
looking
into
his
face
with
a
particularly
kindly
attention
.

and
after
a

he
swayed
his
head
.
vewy
pleased
pwince
to
make
your
acquaintance
he
repeated
again
smiling
sadly
and
he
again
pressed
prince
an
drews
hand
.
prince
andrew
knew
denisov
from
what
na
tasha
had
told
him
of
her
first
suitor
.
this
memory
carried
him
sadly
and
sweetly
back
to
those
painful
feelings
of
which
he
had
not
thought
lately
but
which
still
found
place
in
his
soul
of
late
he
had
received
so
many
new
and
very
serious
impressions
such
as
the
re
treat
from
smolensk
his
visit
to
bald
hills
and
the
recent
news
of
his
fathers
death
and
had
experienced
so
many
emotions
that
for
a
long
time
past
those
memories
had
not
entered
his
mind
and
now
that
they
did
they
did
not
act
on
him
with
nearly
their
former
strength
.
for
denisov
too
the
memories
awakened
by
the
name
of
bolk6nski
belonged
to
a
distant
romantic
past
when
after
supper
and
after
natashas
singing
he
had
proposed
to
a
little
girl
of
fifteen
without
realizing
what
he
was
doing
.
he
smiled
at
the
recollection
of
that
time
and
of
his
love
for
natdsha
and
passed
at
once
to
what
now
interested
him
passionately
and
exclusively
.
this
was
a
plan
of
campaign
he
had
devised
while
serving
at
the
outposts
during
the
retreat
.
he
had
proposed
that
plan
to
barclay
de
tolly
and
now
wished
to
pro
pose
it
to
kutiizov
.
the
plan
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
french
line
of
operation
was
too
extended
and
it
proposed
that
instead
of
or
concurrently
with
action
on
the
front
to
bar
the
advance
of
the
french
we
should
attack
their
line
of
communication
.
he
began
ex
plaining
his
plan
to
prince
andrew
.
they
cant
hold
all
that
line
.
its
impossible
.
i
will
undertake
to
bweak
thwough
.
give
me
five
hundwed
men
and
i
will
bweak
the
line
thats
certain
theres
only
one
way
guewilla
warfare
denisov
rose
and
began
gesticulating
as
he
explained
his
plan
to
bolk6nski
.
in
the
midst
of
his
explanation
shouts
were
heard
from
the
army
growing
more
incoherent
and
more
dif
fused
mingling
with
music
and
songs
and
com
ing
from
the
field
where
the
review
was
held
.
sounds
of
hoofs
and
shouts
were
nearing
the
village
.
hes
coming
hes
coming
shouted
a
cos
sack
standing
at
the
gate
.
bolk6nski
and
denisov
moved
to
the
gate
at
which
a
knot
of
soldiers
a
guard
of
honor
was
standing
and
they
saw
kutiizov
coming
down
the
street
mounted
on
a
rather
small
sorrel
horse
.
a
huge
suite
of
generals
rode
behind
him
.
barclay
was
riding
almost
beside
him
and
a
crowd
of
officers
ran
after
and
around
them
shouting
hurrah
his
adjutants
galloped
into
the
yard
be
fore
him
.
kutiizov
was
impatiently
urging
on
his
horse
which
ambled
smoothly
under
his
weight
and
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
white
horse
guards
cap
with
a
red
band
and
no
peak
nodding
his
head
continually
.
when
he
came
up
to
the
guard
of
honor
a
fine
set
of
grenadiers
mostly
wearing
decorations
who
were
giving
him
the
salute
he
looked
at
them
silently
and
attentively
for
nearly
a
minute
with
the
steady
gaze
of
a
commander
and
then
turned
to
the
crowd
of
generals
and
officers
surrounding
him
.
suddenly
his
face
assumed
a
subtle
expression
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
an
air
of
perplexity
.
and
with
such
fine
fellows
to
retreat
and
retreat
well
goodby
general
he
added
and
rode
into
the
yard
past
prince
andrew
and
denisov
.
hurrah

hurrah
shouted
those
be
hind
him
.
since
prince
andrew
had

seen
him

and
fat

but
the
bleached
eyeball
the
scar
and
the
familiar
weariness
of
his
expression
were
still
the

.
he

a

hanging
over

on

he
whistled
just
audibly
as
he
rode
into
the
yard
.
his
face
expressed
the
relief
of
relaxed
strain
felt
by
a
man
who
means
to
rest
after
a
ceremony
.
he
drew
his

he
pulled
himself
together

round
screwing
up
his

at
prince

and
evidently
not
recognizing
him
moved
with
his
waddling
gait
to
the
porch

he

and
again
glanced
at
prince

.
as
often
oc

with
old
men
it
was
only
after
some
sec
onds
that
the
impression
produced
by
prince
andrews
face
linked
itself
up
with
kutiizovs
remembrance
of
his
personality
.
ah
how
do
you
do
my
dear
prince
how
do
you
do
my
dear
boy
come
along

.

.
said
he
glancing
wearily
round
and
he
stepped
on
to
the
porch
which
creaked
under
his
weight
.
he
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
in
the
porch
.
and
hows
your
father
i
received
news
of
his
death
yesterday
re
plied
prince
andrew
abruptly
.
kutuzov
looked
at
him
with
eyes
wide
open
with
dismay
and
then
took
off
his
cap
and
crossed
himself
may
the
kingdom
of
heaven
be
hisl
gods
will
be
done
to
us
all
he
sighed
deeply
his
whole
chest
heaving
and
was
silent
for
a
while
.
i
loved
him
and
respected
him
and
sympa
thize
with
you
with
all
my
heart
.
he
embraced
prince
andrew
pressing
him
to
his
fat
breast
and
for
some
time
did
not
let
him
go
.
when
he
released
him
prince
andrew
saw
that
kutuzovs
flabby
lips
were
trembling
and
that
tears
were
in
his
eyes
he
sighed
and
pressed
on
the
bench
with
both
hands
to
raise
himself
.
cornel
come
with
me
well
have
a
talk
said
he
.
but
at
that
moment
denfsov
no
more
in
timidated
by
his
superiors
than
by
the
enemy
came
with
jingling
spurs
up
the
steps
of
the
porch
despite
the
angry
whispers
of
the
ad
jutants
who
tried
to
stop
him
.
kutuzov
his
hands
still
pressed
on
the
seat
glanced
at
him
glumly
.
denfsov
having
given
his
name
an
nounced
that
he
had
to
communicate
to
his
serene
highness
a
matter
of
great
importance
for
their
countrys
welfare
.
kutuzov
looked
wearily
at
him
arid
lifting
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
annoyance
folded
them
across
his
stomach
repeating
the
words
for
our
coun
trys
welfare
well
what
is
it
speak
den
isov
blushed
like
a
girl
it
was
strange
to
see
the
color
rise
in
that
shaggy
bibulous
time
worn
face
and
boldly
began
to
expound
his
plan
of
cutting
the
enemys
lines
of
communi
cation
between
smolensk
and
vydzma
.
denisov
came
from
those
parts
and
knew
the
country
well
.
his
plan
seemed
decidedly
a
good
one
es
pecially
from
the
strength
of
conviction
with
which
he
spoke
.
kutuzov
looked
down
at
his
own
legs
occasionally
glancing
at
the
door
of
the
adjoining
hut
as
if
expecting
something
unpleasant
to
emerge
from
it
.
and
from
that
hut
while
denfsov
was
speaking
a
general
with
a
portfolio
under
his
arm
really
did
appear
.
what
said
kutuzov
in
the
midst
of
den
isov
s
explanations
are
you
ready
so
soon
ready
your
serene
highness
replied
the
general
.
kutuzov
swayed
his
head
as
much
as
to
say
how
is
one
man
to
deal
with
it
all
and
again
listened
to
denfsov
.
i
give
my
word
of
honor
as
a
wussian
of
ficer
said
denfsov
that
i
can
bweak

of

what
relation
are
you
to

gen
eral
kirfl
a
ndreevich
denisov
asked
kutuzov
interrupting
him
.
he
is
my
uncle
your
sewene
highness
.
ah
we
were
friends
said
kutuzov
cheer
fully
.
all
right
all
right
friend
stay
here
at
the
staff
and
tomorrow
well
have
a
talk
.
with
a
nod
to
denfsov
he
turned
away
and
put
out
his
hand
for
the
papers
konovnftsyn
had
brought
him
.
would
not
your
serene
highness
like
to
come
inside
said
the
general
on
duty
in
a
dis
contented
voice
the
plans
must
be
examined
and
several
papers
have
to
be
signed
.
an
adjutant
came
out
and
announced
that
everything
was
in
readiness
within
.
but
kutu
zov
evidently
did
not
wish
to
enter
that
room
till
he
was
disengaged
.
he
made
a
grimace
no
tell
them
to
bring
a
small
table
out
here
my
dear
boy
.
ill
look
at
them
here
said
he
.
dont
go
away
he
added
turning
to
prince
andrew
who
remained
in
the
porch
and
listened
to
the
generals
report
.
while
this
was
being
given
prince
andrew
heard
the
whisper
of
a
womans
voice
and
the
rustle
of
a
silk
dress
behind
the
door
.
several
424
war
and
peace
times
on
glancing
that
way
he
noticed
behind
that
door
a
plump
rosy
handsome
woman
in
a
pink
dress
with
a
lilac
silk
kerchief
on
her
head
holding
a
dish
and
evidently
awaiting
the
entrance
of
the
commander
in
chief
.
ku
tuzovs
adjutant
whispered
to
prince
andrew
that
this
was
the
wite
of
the
priest
whose
home
it
was
and
that
she
intended
to
offer
his
se
rene
highness
bread
and
salt
.
her
husband
has
welcomed
his
serene
highness
with
the
cross
at
the
church
and
she
intends
to
wel
come
him
in
the
house
.


.

.
shes
very
pretty
added
the
adjutant
with
a
smile
.
at
those
words
kutuzov
looked
round
.
he
was
listening
to
the
generals
reportwhich
consisted
chiefly
of
a
criticism
of
the
position
at
tsarevozay
mishche
as
he
had
listened
to
denfsov
and
seven
years
previously
had
listened
to
the
dis
cussion
at
the
austerlitz
council
of
war
.
he
evidently
listened
only
because
he
had
ears
which
though
there
was
a
piece
of
tow
in
one
of
them
could
not
help
hearing
but
it
was
ev
ident
that
nothing
the
general
could
say
would
surprise
or
even
interest
him
that
he
knew
all
that
would
be
said
beforehand
and
heard
it
all
only
because
he
had
to
as
one
has
to
listen
to
the
chanting
of
a
service
of
prayer
.
all
that
denisov
had
said
was
clever
and
to
the
point
.
what
the
general
was
saying
was
even
more
clever
and
to
the
point
but
it
was
evident
that
kutuzov
despised
knowledge
and
cleverness
and
knew
of
something
else
that
would
decide
the
matter
something
independent
of
clever
ness
and
knowledge
.
prince
andrew
watched
the
commander
in
chiefs
face
attentively
and
the
only
expression
he
could
see
there
was
one
of
boredom
curiosity
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
feminine
whispering
behind
the
door
and
a
desire
to
observe
propriety
.
it
was
evident
that
kutuzov
despised
cleverness
and
learning
and
even
the
patriotic
feeling
shown
by
denisov
but
despised
them
not
because
of
his
own
in
tellect
feelings
or
knowledge
he
did
not
try
to
display
any
of
these
but
because
of
some
thing
else
.
he
despised
them
because
of
his
old
age
and
experience
of
life
.
the
only
in
struction
kutuzov
gave
of
his
own
accord
dur
ing
that
report
referred
to
looting
by
the
rus
sian
troops
.
at
the
end
of
the
report
the
gen
eral
put
before
him
for
signature
a
paper
re
lating
to
the
recovery
of
payment
from
army
commanders
for
green
oats
mown
down
by
the
soldiers
when
landowners
lodged
petitions
for
compensation
.
after
hearing
the
matter
kutiizov
smacked
his
lips
together
and
shook
his
head
.
into
the
stove

.

.

.
into
the
fire
with
itl
i
tell
you
once
for
all
my
dear
fellow
said
he
in
to
the
fire
with
all
such
things
let
them
cut
the
crops
and
burn
wood
to
their
hearts
con
tent
.
i
dont
order
it
or
allow
it
but
i
dont
exact
compensation
either
.
one
cant
get
on
without
it
.
when
wood
is
chopped
the
chips
will
fly
.

he
looked
at
the
paper
again
.
oh
this
german
precision
he
muttered
shaking
his
head
.
chapter
xvi
well
thats
all
said
kutiizov
as
he
signed
the
last
of
the
documents
and
rising
heavily
and
smoothing
out
the
folds
in
his
fat
white
neck
he
moved
toward
the
door
with
a
more
cheerful
expression
.
the
priests
wife
flushing
rosy
red
caught
up
the
dish
she
had
after
all
not
managed
to
present
at
the
right
moment
though
she
had
so
long
been
preparing
for
it
and
with
a
low
bow
offered
it
to
kutuzov
.
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
smiled
lifted
her
chin
with
his
hand
and
said
ah
what
a
beauty
i
thank
you
sweetheart
he
took
some
gold
pieces
from
his
trouser
pocket
and
put
them
on
the
dish
for
her
.
well
my
dear
and
how
are
we
getting
on
he
asked
moving
to
the
door
of
the
room
as
signed
to
him
.
the
priests
wife
smiled
and
with
dimples
in
her
rosy
cheeks
followed
him
into
the
room
.
the
adjutant
came
out
to
the
porch
and
asked
prince
andrew
to
lunch
with
him
.
half
an
hour
later
prince
andrew
was
again
called
to
kutuzov
.
he
found
him
reclin
ing
in
an
armchair
still
in
the
same
unbut
toned
overcoat
.
he
had
in
his
hand
a
french
book
which
he
closed
as
prince
andrew
en
tered
marking
the
place
with
a
knife
.
prince
andrew
saw
by
the
cover
that
it
was
les
chev
aliers
du
cygne
by
madame
de
genlis
.
well
sit
clown
sit
down
here
.
lets
have
a
talk
said
kutuzov
.
its
sad
very
sad
.
but
re
member
my
clear
fellow
that
i
am
a
father
to
you
a
second
father
.

.

.

.
prince
andrew
told
kutuzov
all
he
knew
of
his
fathers
death
and
what
he
had
seen
at
bald
hills
when
he
passed
through
it
.
what

.

.

.
what
they
have
brought
us
to
kutuzov
suddenly
cried
in
an
agitated
voice
evidently
picturing
vividly
to
himself
from
prince
andrews
story
the
condition
russia
was
in
.
but
give
me
time
give
me
time
he
said
with
a
grim
look
evidently
not
wishing
to
con
tinue
this
agitating
conversation
and
added
i
sent
for
you
to
keep
you
with
me
.
book
i
thank
your
serene
highness
but
i
fear
i
am
no
longer
fit
for
the
staff
replied
prince
andrew
with
a
smile
which
kuttizov
noticed
.
kutuzov
glanced
inquiringly
at
him
.
but
above
all
added
prince
andrew
i
have
grown
used
to
my
regiment
am
fond
of
the
officers
and
i
fancy
the
men
also
like
me
.
i
should
be
sorry
to
leave
the
regiment
.
if
i
de
cline
the
honor
of
being
with
you
believe
me

.

.

.
a
shrewd
kindly
yet
subtly
derisive
expres
sion
lit
up
kutuzovs
podgy
face
.
he
cut
bol
k6nski
short
.
i
am
sorry
for
i
need
you
.
but
youre
right
youre
right
its
not
here
that
men
are
needed
.
advisers
are
always
plentiful
but
men
are
not
.
the
regiments
would
not
be
what
they
are
if
the
wouldbe
advisers
served
there
as
you
do
.
i
remember
you
at
austerlitz
.

..
.
i
remember
yes
i
remember
you
with
the
standard
said
kutuzov
and
a
flush
of
pleasure
suffused
prince
andrews
face
at
this
recollection
.
taking
his
hand
and
drawing
him
down
wards
kutuzov
offered
his
cheek
to
be
kissed
and
again
prince
andrew
noticed
tears
in
the
old
mans
eyes
.
though
prince
andrew
knew
that
kutuzovs
tears
came
easily
and
that
he
was
particularly
tender
to
and
considerate
of
him
from
a
wish
to
show
sympathy
with
his
loss
yet
this
reminder
of
austerlitz
was
both
pleas
ant
and
flattering
to
him
.
go
your
way
and
god
be
with
you
.
i
know
your
path
is
the
path
of
honor
he
paused
.
i
missed
you
at
bucharest
but
i
needed
some
one
to
send
.
and
changing
the
subject
kutu
zov
began
to
speak
of
the
turkish
war
and
the
peace
that
had
been
concluded
.
yes
i
have
been
much
blamed
he
said
both
for
that
war
and
the
peace

.

.

.
but
everything
came
at
the
right
time
.
tout
vient
a
point

celui
qui
salt
attendre
and
there
were
as
many
advisers
there
as
here

.

.

.
he
went
on
returning
to
the
subject
of
advisers
which
evidently
occupied
him
.
ah
those
advisers
said
he
.
if
we
had
listened
to
them
all
we
should
not
have
made
peace
with
turkey
and
should
not
have
been
through
with
that
war
.
everything
in
haste
but
more
haste
less
speed
.
kamenski
would
have
been
lost
if
he
had
not
died
.
he
stormed
fortresses
with
thirty
thousand
men
.
it
is
not
difficult
to
capture
a
fortress
but
it
is
difficult
to
win
a
campaign
.
for
that
not
storm
ing
and
attacking
but
patience
and
time
are
wanted
.

and

i
he
swayed
his
head
.
and
the
french

me
he
went
on
growing
warmer
and
beating
his
chest
ill
make
them

and
tears
again
dimmed
his
eyes
.
but

asked
evidently
expecting

.
well

he
repeated
and
his
eye
shone
with
a
deep
shrewd
look
.

he
continued
as

did
not

he

the
french
proverb
deliberately
.
well

my
dear
fellow
remember
that
with
all

i
share
your
sorrow
and
that
for
you
i

if

come

goodby
my

boy
.
again
he
embraced
and
kissed
prince
an
drew
but
before
the
latter
had
left
the
room
kutuzov
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
went
on
with
his
unfinished
novel
les
chevaliers
du
cygne
by
madame
de
gcnlis
.
prince
andrew
could
not
have
explained
how
or
why
it
was
but
after
that
interview
with
kutuzov
he
went
back
to

as

the
more
he
realized
the
absence
of
all

in
that
old
man
in
whom
there
seemed
to
remain

in

of

drawing
conclusions
only
the
capacity

to

reassured
he
was
that
everything
would
be
as
it

not

own

the
inevitable
course
of

and
he
can
see

their

and
seeing
that

can
refrain
from

and
renounce

and
above
all
thought
prince
andrew
one
believes
in
him
because
hes
russian
despite
the
novel
bygen
lis
and
the
french
proverbs
and
because
his
voice
shook
when
he
said
what
they
have
brought
us
to
and
had
a
sob
in
it
when
he
said
he
would
make
them
eat
horseflesh

on
such
feelings
more
or
less
dimly
shared
by
all
the
unanimity
and
general
approval
were
founded
with
which
despite
court
influ
ences
the
popular
choice
of
kutiizov
as
com
mander
in
chief
was
received
.
chapter
xvii
after
the
emperor
had
left
moscow
life
flowed
on
there
in
its
usual
course
and
its
course
was
so
very
usual
that
it
was
difficult
to
remember
the
recent
days
of
patriotic
elation
and
ardor
hard
to
believe
that
russia
was
real
ly
in
danger
and
that
the
members
of
the
eng
lish
club
were
also
sons
of
the
fatherland
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
for
it
.
the
one
thing
that
recalled
the
patriotic
fervor
every
one
had
displayed
during
the
emperors
stay
was
the
call
for
contributions
of
men
and
money
a
necessity
that
as
soon
as
the
prom
ises
had
been
made
assumed
a
legal
official
form
and
became
unavoidable
.
with
the
enemys
approach
to
moscow
the
moscovites
view
of
their
situation
did
not
grow
more
serious
but
on
the
contrary
became
even
more
frivolous
as
always
happens
with
people
who
see
a
great
danger
approaching
.
at
the
approach
of
danger
there
are
always
two
voices
that
speak
with
equal
power
in
the
human
soul
one
very
reasonably
tells
a
man
to
consider
the
nature
of
the
danger
and
the
means
of
escaping
it
the
other
still
more
reasonably
says
that
it
is
too
depressing
and
painful
to
think
of
the
danger
since
it
is
not
in
mans
power
to
foresee
everything
and
avert
the
general
course
of
events
and
it
is
therefore
better
to
disregard
what
is
painful
till
it
comes
and
to
think
about
what
is
pleasant
.
in
solitude
a
man
generally
listens
to
the
first
voice
but
in
society
to
the
second
.
so
it
was
now
with
the
inhabitants
of
moscow
.
it
was
long
since
peo
ple
had
been
as
gay
in
moscow
as
that
year
.
rostopchins
broadsheets
headed
by
wood
cuts
of
a
drink
shop
a
potman
and
a
moscow
burgher
called
karpiishka
chigirin
who
having
been
a
militiaman
and
having
had
rath
er
too
much
at
the
pub
heard
that
napoleon
wished
to
come
to
moscow

bad

out
of
the
drink
shop
and
under
the
sign
of
the

began
to
address
the
assembled
people
were
read
and
discussed
together
with
the
lat
est
of
vasfli
lvovich
pushkins
bouts
rimes
.
in
the
corner
room
at
the
club
members
gathered
to
read
these
broadsheets
and
some
liked
the
way
karpushka
jeered
at
the
french
saying
they
will
swell
up
with
russian
cab
bage
burst
with
our
buckwheat
porridge
and
choke
themselves
with
cabbage
soup
.
they
are
all
dwarfs
and
one
peasant
woman
will
toss
three
of
them
with
a
hayfork
others
did
not
like
that
tone
and
said
itwas
stupid
and
vulgar
.
it
was
said
that
rostopchfn
had
expelled
all
frenchmen
and
even
all
foreigners
from
mos
cow
and
that
there
had
been
some
spies
and
agents
of
napoleon
among
them
but
this
was
told
chiefly
to
introduce
rostopchfns
witty
re
mark
on
that
occasion
.
the
foreigners
were
deported
to
nizhni
by
boat
and
rostopchin
had
said
to
them
in
french
rentrez
en
vous
msmes
entrez
dans
la
barque
et
nen
faites
pas
une
barque
de
charon
.

there
was
talk
of
all
the
government
offices
having
been
al
ready
removed
from
moscow
and
to
this
shin
shfns
witticism
was
added
that
for
that
alone
moscow
ought
to
be
grateful
to
napoleon
.
it
was
said
that
mam6novs
regiment
would
cost
him
eight
hundred
thousand
rubles
and
that
bezukhov
had
spent
even
more
on
his
but
that
the
best
thing
about
beziikhovs
action
was
that
he
himself
was
going
to
don
a
uniform
and
ride
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
without
charging
anything
for
the
show

said
julie
directing
a
sly

glance
to
ward
the
militia
officer
the
latter
in
pierres
presence
had
ceased
to
be
caustic
and
his
face
expressed
perplexity
as
to
what
julies
smile
might
mean
.
in
spite
of
his
absentmindedness
and
good
nature
pi

personality
immediately
checked
any
at

to
ridicule
him
to
his

pierre
with
a
laughing
glance
at
his
big
stout
body
.

among
those

happened
to

about
were
the

julie

and
he
is
so
unreasonable
the

himself

the

wanted
to

the

speaking
of

a
kindly
old
man
but
not
up
to
much
.
and
why
do
they
stay
on
so
long

but
how
could
one
say
that
in
russian
chapter
xviii
when
pierre
returned
home
he
was
handed
two
of
rostopchins
broadsheets
that
had
been
brought
that
day
.
the
first
declared
that
the
report
that
count
rostopchin
had
forbidden
people
to
leave
moscow
was
false
on
the
contrary
he
was
glad
that
ladies
and
tradesmens
wives
were
leaving
the
city
.
there
will
be
less
panic
and
less
gos
sip
ran
the
broadsheet
but
i
will
stake
my
lifeon
it
that
that
scoundrel
will
not
enter
mos
cow
.
these
words
showed
pierre
clearly
for
the
first
time
that
the
french
would
enter
mos
cow
.
the
second
broadsheet
stated
that
our
headquarters
were
at
vydzma
that
count
witt
genstein
had
defeated
the
french
but
that
as
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
moscow
wished
to
be
armed
weapons
were
ready
for
them
at
the
arsenal
sabers
pistols
and
muskets
which
could
be
had
at
a
low
price
.
the
tone
of
the
proclamation
was
not
as
jocose
as
in
the
former
chigirin
talks
.
pierre
pondered
over
these
broadsheets
.
evidently
the
terrible
stormcloud
he
had
desired
with
the
whole
strength
of
his
soul
but
which
yet
aroused
involuntary
horror
in
him
was
drawing
near
.

i
join
the
army
and

service

he
asked
himself
for
the
hundredth
time
.
he
took
a
pack
of
cards
that
lay
on
the
table
and
began
to
lay
them
out
for
a
game
of
patience
.
if
this
patience

he
said
to
him

the
cards

them
in

lifting

the
princess
was
apparently
vexed
at
not
having
anyone
to
be
angry
with
.
muttering
to
herself
she
sat
down
on
a
chair
.
but
you
have
been
misinformed
said
pierre
.
everything
is
quiet
in
the
city
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
danger
.
see
ive
just
been
reading

he
showed

the
broad
sheet

count
rostopchfn
writes
that
he
will
stake
his
life
on
it
that

.
oh
that
count
of
yours
said
the
princess
malevolently
.
he
is
a
hypocrite
a
rascal
who
has
himself
roused
the
people
to
riot
.
didnt
he
write
in
those
idiotic
broadsheets
that
anyone
whoever
it
might
be
should
be
dragged
to
the
lockup
by
his
hair
how
silly
and
honor
and
glory
to
whoever
captures
him
he
says
.
book

this
is
what
his
cajolery
has
brought
us
to
barbara
ivdnovna
told
me
the
mob
nearly
killed
her
because
she
said
something
in
french
.
oh
but
its
so

..
.
you
take
everything
so
to
heart
said
pierre
and
began
laying
out
his
cards
for
patience
.
although
that
patience
did
come
out
pierre
did
not
join
the
army
but
remained
in
desert
ed
moscow
ever
in
the
same
state
of
agitation
irresolution
and
alarm
yet
at
the
same
time
joyfully
expecting
something
terrible
.
next
day
toward
evening
the
princess
set
off
and
pierres
head
steward
came
to
inform
him
that
the
money
needed
for
the
equipment
of
his
regiment
could
not
be
found
without
selling
one
of
the
estates
.
in
general
the
head
steward
made
out
to
pierre
that
his
project
of
raising
a
regiment
would
ruin
him
.
pierre
listened
to
him
scarcely
able
to
repress
a
smile
.
well
then
sell
it
said
he
.
whats
to
be
done
i
cant
draw
back
now
the
worse
everything
became
especially
his
own
affairs
the
better
was
pierre
pleased
and
the
more
evident
was
it
that
the
catastrophe
he
expected
was
approaching
.
hardly
anyone
he
knew
was
left
in
town
.
julie
had
gone
and
so
had
princess
mary
.
of
his
intimate
friends
on
ly
the
rost6vs
remained
but
he
did
not
go
to
see
them
.
to
distract
his
thoughts
he
drove
that
day
to
the
village
of
voronts6vo
to
see
the
great
balloon
leppich
was
constructing
to
destroy
the
foe
and
a
trial
balloon
that
was
to
go
up
next
day
.
the
balloon
was
not
yet
ready
but
pierre
learned
that
it
was
being
constructed
by
the
emperors
desire
.
the
emperor
had
writ
ten
to
count
rostopchin
as
follows
as
soon
as
leppich
is
ready
get
together
a
crew
of
reliable
and
intelligent
men
for
his
car
and
send
a
courier
to
general
kutuzov
to
let
him
know
.
i
have
informed
him
of
the
matter
.
please
impress
upon
leppich
to
be
very
careful
where
he
descends
for
the
first
time
that
he
may
not
make
a
mistake
and
fall
into
the
enemys
hands
.
it
is
essential
for
him
to
combine
his
move
ments
with
those
of
the
commander
in
chief
.
on
his
way
home
from
voronts6vo
as
he
was
passing
the
bol6tnoe
place
pierre
seeing
a
large
crowd
round
the
l6bnoe
place
stopped
and
got
out
of
his
trap
.
a
french
cook
accused
of
being
a
spy
was
being
flogged
.
the
flogging
was
only
just
over
and
the
executioner
was
re
leasing
from
the
flogging
bench
a
stout
man
with
red
whiskers
in
blue
stockings
and
a
green
jacket
who
was
moaning
piteously
.
an
other
criminal
thin
and
pale
stood
near
.
judg
ing
by
their
faces
they
were
both
frenchmen
.
with
a
frightened
and
suffering
look
resem
bling
that
on
the
thin
frenchmans
face
pierre
pushed
his
way
in
through
the
crowd
.
what
is
it
who
is
it
what
is
it
for
he
kept
asking
.
but
the
attention
of
the
crowd
officials
burghers
shopkeepers
peasants
and
women
in
cloaks
and
in
pelisses
was
so
eagerly
cen
tered
on
what
was
passing
in
l6bnoe
place
that
no
one
answered
him
.
the
stout
man
rose
frowned
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
evidently
trying
to
appear
firm
began
to
pull
on
his
jack
et
without
looking
about
him
but
suddenly
his
lips
trembled
and
he
began
to
cry
in
the
way
fullblooded
grownup
men
cry
though
angry
with
himself
for
doing
so
.
in
the
crowd
peo
ple
began
talking
loudly
to
stifle
their
feelings
of
pity
as
it
seemed
to
pierre
.
hes
cook
to
some
prince
.
eh
mounseer
russian
sauce
seems
to
be
sour
to
a
frenchman

.

.

.
sets
his
teeth
on
edgel
said
a
wrinkled
clerk
who
was
standing
behind
pierre
when
the
frenchman
began
to
cry
.
the
clerk
glanced
round
evidently
hoping
that
his
joke
would
be
appreciated
.
some
peo
ple
began
to
laugh
others
continued
to
watch
in
dismay
the
executioner
who
was
undressing
the
other
man
.
pierre
choked
his
face
puckered
and
he
turned
hastily
away
went
back
to
his
trap
mut
tering
something
to
himself
as
he
went
and
took
his
seat
.
as
they
drove
along
he
shuddered
and
exclaimed
several
times
so
audibly
that
the
coachman
asked
him
what
is
your
pleasure
where
are
you
going
shouted
pierre
to
the
man
who
was
driving
to
lubyanka
street
.
to
the
governors
as
you
ordered
an
swered
the
coachman
.
fool
idiot
shouted
pierre
abusing
his
coachman
a
thing
he
rarely
did
.
home
i
told
you
and
drive
faster
blockhead
i
must
get
away
this
very
day
he
murmured
to
himself
.
at
the
sight
of
the
tortured
frenchman
and
the
crowd
surrounding
the
l6bnoe
place
pierre
had
so
definitely
made
up
his
mind
that
he
could
no
longer
remain
in
moscow
and
would
leave
for
the
army
that
very
day
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
either
he
had
told
the
coachman
this
or
that
the
man
ought
to
have
known
it
for
himself
.
on
reaching

.home
pierre
gave
orders
to
evstfey
his
head
coachman
who
knew
every
thing
could
do
anything
and
was
known
to
all
430
moscow
that
he
would
leave
that
night
for
the
army
at
mozhdysk
and
that
his
saddle
horses
should
be
sent
there
.
this
could
not
all
be
arranged
that
day
so
on
evstdfeys
represen
tation
pierre
had
to
put
off
his
departure
till
next
day
to
allow
time
for
the
relay
horses
to
be
sent
on
in
advance
.
on
the
twentyfourth
the
weather
cleared
up
after
a
spell
of
rain
and
after
dinner
pierre
left
moscow
.
when
changing
horses
that
night
in
perkhushkovo
he
learned
that
there
had
been
a
great
battle
that
evening
.
this
was
the
battle
of
shevdrdino
.
he
was
told
that
there
in
perkhushkovo
the
earth
trembled
from
the
firing
but
nobody
could
answer
his
questions
as
to
who
had
won
.
at
dawn
next
day
pierre
was
approaching
mozhdysk
.
every
house
in
mozhdysk
had
soldiers
quar
tered
in
it
and
at
the
hostel
where
pierre
was
met
by
his
groom
and
coachman
there
was
no
room
to
be
had
.
it
was
full
of
officers
.
everywhere
in
mozhaysk
and
beyond
it
troops
were
stationed
or
on
the
march
.
cos
sacks
foot
and
horse
soldiers
wagons
caissons
and
cannon
were
everywhere
.
pierre
pushed
forward
as
fast
as
he
could
and
the
further
he
left
moscow
behind
and
the
deeper
he
plunged
into
that
sea
of
troops
the
more
was
he
over
come
by
restless
agitation
and
a
new
and
joy
ful
feeling
he
had
not
experienced
before
.
it
was
a
feeling
akin
to
what
he
had
felr
at
the
slob6da
palace
during
the
emperors
visita
sense
of
the
necessity
of
undertaking
some
thing
and
sacrificing
something
.
lie
now
ex
perienced
a
glad
consciousness
that
everything
that
constitutes
mens
happiness
the
comforts
of
life
wealth
even
life
itself
is
rubbish
it
is
pleasant
to
throw
away
compared
with
some
thing

.

.

.
with
what
pierre
could
not
say
and
he
did
not
try
to
determine
for
whom
and
for
what
he
felt
such
particular
delight
in
sacrific
ing
everything
.
he
was
not
occupied
with
the
question
of
what
to
sacrifice
for
the
fact
of
sacrificing
in
itself
afforded
him
a
new
and
joy
ous
sensation
.
chapter
xix
on
the
twentyfourth
of
august
the
battle
of
the
shevdrdino
redoubt
was
fought
on
the
twentyfifth
not
a
shot
was
fired
by
either
side
and
on
the
twentysixth
the
battle
of
borodin6
itself
took
place
.
why
and
how
were
the
battles
of
shevdrdino
and
borodin6
given
and
accepted
why
was
the
battle
of
borodin6
fought
there
was
not
the
least
sense
in
it
for
either
the
french
or
war
and
peace
the
russians
.
its
immediate
result
for
the
rus
sians
was
and
wa
bound
to
be
that
we
were
brought
nearer
to
the
destruction
of
moscow
which
we
feared
more
than
anything
in
the
world
and
for
the
french
its
immediate
re
sult
was
that
they
were
brought
nearer
to
the
destruction
of
their
whole
army
which
they
feared
more
than
anything
in
the
world
.
what
the
result
must
be
was
quite
obvious
and
yet
napoleon
offered
and
kutuzov
accepted
that
battle
.
if
the
commanders
had
been
guided
by
rea
son
it
would
seem
that
it
must
have
been
ob
vious
to
napoleon
that
by
advancing
thirteen
hundred
miles
and
giving
battle
with
a
prob
ability
of
losing
a
quarter
of
his
army
he
was
advancing
to
certain
destruction
and
it
must
have
been
equally
clear
to
kutiizov
that
by
ac
cepting
battle
and
risking
the
loss
of
a
quarter
of
his
army
he
would
certainly
lose
moscow
.
for
kutuzov
this
was
mathematically
clear
as
it
is
that
if
when
playing
draughts
i
have
one
man
less
and
go
on
exchanging
i
shall
certainly
lose
and
therefore
should
not
exchange
.
when
my
opponent
has
sixteen
men
and
i
have
four
teen
i
am
only
one
eighth
weaker
than
he
but
when
i
have
exchanged
thirteen
more
men
he
will
be
three
times
as
strong
as
i
am
.
before
the
battle
of
borodin6
our
strength
in
proportion
to
the
french
was
about
as
five
to
six
but
after
that
battle
it
was
little
more
than
one
to
two
previously
we
had
a
hundred
thousand
against
a
hundred
and
twenty
thou
sand
afterwards
little
more
than
fifty
thousand
against
a
hundred
thousand
.
yet
the
shrewd
and
experienced
kutuzov
accepted
the
battle
while
napoleon
who
was
said
to
be
a
com
mander
of
genius
gave
it
losing
a
quarter
of
his
army
and
lengthening
his
lines
of
commu
nication
still
more
.
if
it
is
said
that
he
expected
to
end
the
campaign
by
occupying
moscow
as
he
had
ended
a
previous
campaign
by
occupy
ing
vienna
there
is
much
evidence
to
the
con
trary
.
napoleons
historians
themselves
tell
us
that
from
smolensk
onwards
he
wished
to
stop
knew
the
danger
of
his
extended
position
and
knew
that
the
occupation
of
moscow
would
not
be
the
end
of
the
campaign
for
he
had
seen
at
smolensk
the
state
in
which
russian
towns
were
left
to
him
and
had
not
received
a
single
reply
to
his
repeated
announcements
of
his
wish
to
negotiate
.
in
giving
and
accepting
battle
at
borodin6
kutuzov
acted
involuntarily
and
irrationally
.
but
later
on
to
fit
what
had
occurred
the
his
torians
provided
cunningly
devised
evidence
of
the
foresight
and
genius
of
the
generals
who
of
all
the
blind
tools
of
history
were
the
most
enslaved
and
involuntary
.
the
ancients
have
left
us
model
heroic
po
ems
in
which
the
heroes
furnish
the
whole
in
terest
of
the
story
and
we
are
still
unable
to
accustom
ourselves
to
the
fact
that
for
our
ep
och
histories
of
that
kind
are
meaningless
.
on
the
other
question
how
the
battle
of
borodin6
and
the
preceding
battle
of
shevdr
dino
were
fought
there
also
exists
a
definite
and
wellknown
but
quite
false
conception
.
all
the
historians
describe
the
affair
as
follows
the
russian
army
they
say
in
its
retreat
from
smolensk
sought
out
for
itself
the
best
position
for
a
general
engagement
and
found
such
a
position
at
borodind
.
the
russians
they
say
fortified
this
posi
tion
in
advance
on
the
left
of
the
highroad
from
moscow
to
smolensk
and
almost
at
a
right
angle
to
it
from
borodind
to
utitsa
at
the
very
place
where
the
battle
was
fought
.
in
front
of
this
position
they
say
a
fortified
outpost
was
set
up
on
the
shevdrdino
mound
to
observe
the
enemy
.
on
the
twentyfourth
we
are
told
napoleon
attacked
this
advanced
post
and
took
it
and
on
the
twentysixth
at
tacked
the
whole
russian
army
which
was
in
position
on
the
field
of
borodino
.
so
the
histories
say
and
it
is
all
quite
wrong
as
anyone
who
cares
to
look
into
the
matter
can
easily
convince
himself
.
the
russians
did
not
seek
out
the
best
po
sition
but
on
the
contrary
during
the
retreat
passed
many
positions
better
than
borodin6
.
they
did
not
stop
at
any
one
of
these
positions
because
kutuzov
did
not
wish
to
occupy
a
po
sition
he
had
not
himself
chosen
because
the
popular
demand
for
a
battle
had
not
yet
ex
pressed
itself
strongly
enough
and
because
milorddovich
had
not
yet
arrived
with
the
mi
litia
and
for
many
other
reasons
.
the
fact
is
that
other
positions
they
had
passed
were
stronger
and
that
the
position
at
borodin6
the
one
where
the
battle
was
fought
far
from
being
strong
was
no
more
a
position
than
any
other
spot
one
might
find
in
the
russian
em
pire
by
sticking
a
pin
into
the
map
at
hazard
.
not
only
did
the
russians
not
fortify
the
po
sition
on
the
field
of
borodin6
to
the
left
of
and
at
a
right
angle
to
the
highroad
that
is
the
position
on
which
the
battle
took
place
but
never
till
the
twentyfifth
of
august
1812
did
they
think
that
a
battle
might
be
fought
there
.
this
was
shown
first
by
the
fact
that
there
were
no
entrenchments
there
by
the
book
ten
431
twentyfifth
and
that
those
begun
on
the
twentyfifth
and
twentysixth
were
not
complet
ed
and
secondly
by
the
position
of
the
shevar
dino
redoubt
.
that
redoubt
was
quite
sense
less
in
front
of
the
position
where
the
battle
was
accepted
.
why
was
it
more
strongly
forti
fied
than
any
other
post
and
why
were
all
ef
forts
exhausted
and
six
thousand
men
sacri
ficed
to
defend
it
till
late
at
night
on
the
twentyfourth
a
cossack
patrol
would
have
sufficed
to
observe
the
enemy
.
thirdly
as
proof
that
the
position
on
which
the
battle
was
fought
had
not
been
foreseen
and
that
the
shevdrdino
redoubt
was
not
an
advanced
post
of
that
position
we
have
the
fact
that
up
to
the
twentyfifth
barclay
de
tolly
and
bagrati6n
were
convinced
that
the
shevdrdino
redoubt
was
the
left
flank
of
the
position
and
that
ku
tuzov
himself
in
his
report
written
in
hot
haste
after
the
battle
speaks
of
the
shevdrdino
re
doubt
as
the
left
flank
of
the
position
.
it
was
much
later
when
reports
on
the
battle
of
bor
odin6
were
written
at
leisure
that
the
incorrect
and
extraordinary
statement
was
invented
probably
to
justify
the
mistakes
of
a
com
mander
in
chief
who
had
to
be
represented
as
infallible
that
the
shevdrdino
redoubt
was
an
advanced
post
whereas
in
reality
it
was
sim
ply
a
fortified
point
on
the
left
flank
and
that
the
battle
of
borodino
was
fought
by
us
on
an
entrenched
position
previously
selected
where
as
it
was
fought
on
a
quite
unexpected
spot
which
was
almost
unentrenched
.
the
case
was
evidently
this
a
position
was
selected
along
the
river
kolochd
which
crosses
the
highroad
not
at
a
right
angle
but
at
an
acute
angle
so
that
the
left
flank
was
at
she

the
right
flank
near
the
village
of
n6

and
the
center
at
boroclin6
at
the
conflu
ence
of
the
rivers

and
voyna
.
to
anyone
who
looks
at
the
field
of
boro
dino
without
thinking
of
how
the
battle
was
actually
fought
this
position
protected
by
the
river
kolochd
presents
itself
as
obvious
for
an
army
whose
object
was
to
prevent
an
enemy
from
advancing
along
the
smolensk
road
to
moscow
.
napoleon
riding
to
valuevo
on
the
twenty
fourth
did
not
see
as
the
history
books
say
he
did
the
position
of
the
russians
from
utftsa
to
borodin6
he
could
not
have
seen
that
po
sition
because
it
did
not
exist
nor
did
he
see
an
advanced
post
of
the
russian
army
but
while
pursuing
the
russian
rearguard
he
came
upon
the
left
flank
of
the
russian
position
at
the
shevdrdino
redoubt
and
unexpectedly
432
war
and
peace
for
the
russians
moved
his
army
across
the
ko
lochd
.
and
the
russians
not
having
time
to
begin
a
general
engagement
withdrew
their
left
wing
from
the
position
they
had
intended
to
occupy
and
took
up
a
new
position
which
had
not
been
foreseen
andwas
not
fortified
.
by
crossing
to
the
other
side
of
the
kolochd
to
the
left
of
the
highroad
napoleon
shifted
the
whole
forthcoming
battle
from
right
to
left
looking
from
the
russian
side
and
trans
ferred
it
to
the
plain
between
utitsa
seme
novsk
and
borodino
a
plain
no
more
advan
tageous
as
a
position
than
any
other
plain
in
russia
and
there
the
whole
battle
of
the
twentysixth
of
august
took
place
.
see
the
rough
outline
of
the
plan
of
the
intended
bat
tle
and
of
the
battle
that
actually
took
place
.
had
napoleon
not
ridden
out
on
the
eve
ning
of
the
twentyfourth
to
the
kolochd
and
had
he
not
then
ordered
an
immediate
attack
on
the
redoubt
but
had
begun
the
attack
next
morning
no
one
would
have
doubted
that
the
shevdrdino
redoubt
was
the
left
flank
of
our
position
and
the
battlewould
have
taken
place
where
we
expected
it
.
in
that
case
we
should
probably
have
defended
the
shevdrdino
re
doubtour
left
flank
still
more
obstinately
.
we
should
have
attacked
napoleon
in
the
center
or
on
the
right
and
the
engagement
would
have
taken
place
on
the
twenty
filth
in
the
position
we
intended
and
had
fortified
.
but
as
the
attack
on
our
left
flank
took
place
in
the
evening
after
the
retreat
of
our
rearguard
that
is
immediately
after
the
fight
at
gridneva
and
as
the
russian
commanders
did
not
wish
or
were
not
in
time
to
begin
a
general
engage
ment
then
on
theeveningof
the
twentyfourth
the
first
and
chief
action
of
the
battle
of
boro
dino
was
already
lost
on
the
twentyfourth
and
obviously
led
to
the
loss
of
the
one
fought
on
the
twentysixth
.
after
the
loss
of
the
shevdrdino
redoubt
we
found
ourselves
on
the
morning
of
the
twenty
fifth
without
a
position
for
our
left
flank
and
were
forced
to
bend
it
back
and
hastily
en
trench
it
where
it
chanced
to
be
.
notonlywas
the
russian
army
on
the
twenty
sixth
defended
by
weak
unfinished
entrench
ments
but
the
disadvantage
of
that
position
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
the
russian
com
mandersnot
having
fully
realized
what
had
happened
namely
the
loss
of
our
position
on
the
left
flank
and
the
shifting
of
the
whole
field
of
the
forthcoming
battle
from
right
to
left
maintained
their
extended
position
from
the
village
of
n6voe
to
utftsa
and
consequently
had
to
move
their
forces
from
right
to
left
dur
ing
the
battle
.
so
it
happened
that
throughout
the
whole
battle
the
russians
opposed
the
en
tire
french
army
launched
against
our
left
flank
with
but
half
as
many
men
.
poniatow
skis
action
against
utftsa
and
uvdrovs
on
the
right
flank
against
the
french
were
actions
distinct
from
the
main
course
of
the
battle
.
so
the
battle
of
borodin6
did
not
take
place
at
all
as
in
an
effort
to
conceal
our
commanders
mistakes
even
at
the
cost
of
diminishing
the
glory
due
to
the
russian
army
and
people
it
has
been
described
.
the
battle
of
borodims
was
not
fought
on
a
chosen
and
entrenched
position
with
forces
only
slightly
weaker
than
those
of
the
enemy
but
as
a
result
of
the
loss
of
the
shevdrdino
redoubt
the
russians
fought
the
battle
of
borodin6
on
an
open
and
almost
unentrenched
position
with
forces
on
ly
half
as
numerous
as
the
french
that
is
to
say
under
conditions
in
which
it
was
not
mere
ly
unthinkable
to
fight
for
ten
hours
and
se
cure
an
indecisive
result
but
unthinkable
to
keep
an
army
even
from
complete
disintegra
tion
and
flight
.
chapter
xx
on
the
morning
of
the
twentyfifth
pierre
was
leaving
mozhdysk
.
at
the
descent
of
the
high
steep
hill
down
which
a
winding
road
led
out
of
the
town
past
the
cathedral
on
the
right
where
a
service
was
being
held
and
the
bells
were
ringing
pierre
got
out
of
his
vehicle
and
proceeded
on
foot
.
behind
him
a
cavalry
regi
ment
was
coming
down
the
hill
preceded
by
its
singers
.
coming
up
toward
him
was
a
train
of
carts
carrying
men
who
had
been
wounded
in
the
engagement
the
day
before
.
the
peasant
drivers
shouting
and
lashing
their
horses
kept
crossing
from
side
to
side
.
the
carts
in
each
of
which
three
or
four
wounded
soldiers
were
ly
ing
or
sitting
jolted
over
the
stones
that
had
been
thrown
on
the
steep
incline
to
make
it
something
like
a
road
.
the
wounded
band
aged
with
rags
with
pale
cheeks
compressed
lips
and
knitted
brows
held
on
to
the
sides
of
the
carts
as
they
were
jolted
against
one
anoth
er
.
almost
all
of
them
stared
with
naive
child
like
curiosity
at
pierres
white
hat
and
green
swallowtail
coat
.
pierres
coachman
shouted
angrily
at
the
convoy
of
wounded
to
keep
to
one
side
of
the
road
.
the
cavalry
regiment
as
it
descended
the
hill
with
its
singers
surrounded
pierres
car
riage
and
blocked
the
road
.
pierre
stopped
being
pressed
against
the
side
of
the
cutting
in
book
ten
433
which
the
road
ran
.
the
sunshine
from
behind
the
hill
did
not
penetrate
into
the
cutting
and
there
it
was
cold
and
damp
but
above
pierres
head
was
the
bright
august
sunshine
and
the
bells
sounded
merrily
.
one
of
the
carts
with
wounded
stopped
by
the
side
of
the
road
close
to
pierre
.
the
driver
in
his
bast
shoes
ran
pant
ing
up
to
it
placed
a
stone
under
one
of
its
tireless
hind
wheels
and
began
arranging
the
breechband
on
his
little
horse
.
one
of
the
wounded
an
old
soldier
with
a
bandaged
arm
who
was
following
the
cart
on
foot
caught
hold
of
it
with
his
sound
hand
and
turned
to
look
at
pierre
.
i
say
fellow
countryman
i
will
they
set
us
down
here
or
take
us
on
to
moscow
h
asked
.
pierre
was
so
deep
in
thought
that
he
did
not
hear
the
question
.
he
was
looking
now
at
the
cavalry
regiment
that
had
met
the
convoy
of
wounded
now
at
the
cart
by
which
he
was
standing
in
which
two
wounded
men
were
sitting
and
one
was
lying
.
one
of
those
sitting
up
in
the
cart
had
probably
been
wounded
in
the
cheek
.
his
whole
head
was
wrapped
in
rags
and
one
check
was
swollen
to
the
size
of
a
babys
head
.
his
nose
and
mouth
were
twisted
to
one
side
.
this
soldier
was
looking
at
the
cathedral
and
crossing
himself
.
another
a
young
lad
a
fairhaired
recruit
as
white
as
though
there
was
no
blood
in
his
thin
face
looked
at
pierre
kindly
with
a
fixed
smile
.
the
third
lay
prone
so
that
his
face
was
not
visible
.
the
cavalry
singers
were
passing
close
by
ah
lost
quite
lost

.

.

.
is
my
head
so
keen
living
in
a
foreign
land

.

.

.
they
sang
their
soldiers
dance
song
.
as
if
responding
to
them
but
with
a
different
sort
of
merriment
the
metallic
sound
of
the
bells
reverberated
high
above
and
the
hot
rays
of
the
sun
bathed
the
top
of
the
opposite
slope
with
yet
another
sort
of
merriment
.
but
be
neath
the
slope
by
the
cart
with
the
wounded
near
the
panting
little
nag
where
pierre
stood
it
was
damp
somber
and
sad
.
the
soldier
with
the
swollen
cheek
looked
angrily
at
the
cavalry
singers
.
oh
the
coxcombs
1
he
muttered
reproach
fully
.
its
not
the
soldiers
only
but
ive
seen
peas
ants
today
too
.

.

.

.
the
peasants
even
they
have
to
go
said
the
soldier
behind
the
cart
addressing
pierre
with
a
sad
smile
.
no
dis
tinctions
made
nowadays
.

.

.

.
they
want
the
whole
nation
to
fall
on
them
in
a
word
its
moscow
they
want
to
make
an
end
of
it
.
in
spite
of
the
obscurity
of
the
soldiers
words
pierre
understood
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
nodded
approval
.
the
road
was
clear
again
pierre
descended
the
hill
and
drove
on
.
he
kept
looking
to
either
side
of
the
road
for
familiar
faces
but
only
saw
everywhere
the
unfamiliar
faces
of
various
military
men
of
different
branches
of
the
service
who
all
looked
with
astonishment
at
his
white
hat
and
green
tail
coat
.
having
gone
nearly
three
miles
he
at
last
met
an
acquaintance
and
eagerly
addressed
him
.
this
was
one
of
the
head
army
doctors
.
he
was
driving
toward
pierre
in
a
covered
gig
sitting
beside
a
young
surgeon
and
on
recog
nizing
pierre
he
told
the
cossack
who
occupied
the
drivers
seat
to
pull
up
.
count
your
excellency
how
come
you
to
be
here
asked
the
doctor
.
well
you
know
i
wanted
to
see

.

.

.
yes
yes
there
will
be
something
to
see

pierre
got
out
and
talked
to
the
doctor
ex
plaining
his
intention
of
taking
part
in
a
bat
tle
.
the
doctor
advised
him
to
apply
direct
to
kutiizov
.
why
should
you
be
god
knows
where
out
of
sight
during
the
battle
he
said
exchang
ing
glances
with
his
young
companion
.
any
how
his
serene
highness
knows
you
and
will
receive
you
graciously
.
thats
what
you
must
do
.
the
doctor
seemed
tired
and
in
a
hurry
.
you
think
so

..
.
ah
i
also
wanted
to
ask
you
where
our
position
is
exactly
said
pierre
.
the
position
repeated
the
doctor
.
well
thats
not
my
line
.
drive
past
tatdrinova
a
lot
of
digging
is
going
on
there
.
go
up
the
hill
ock
and
youll
see
.
can
one
see
from
there

..
.
if
you
would
but
the
doctor
interrupted
him
and
moved
toward
his
gig
.
i
would
go
with
you
but
on
my
honor
im
up
to
here
and
he
pointed
to
his
throat
.
im
galloping
to
the
commander
of
the
corps
.
how
do
matters
stand

.

.

.
you
know
count
therell
be
a
battle
tomorrow
.
out
of
an
army
of
a
hun
dred

we
must
expect
at
least
twenty
thousand
wounded
and
we
havent
stretchers
or
bunks
or
dressers
or
doctors
enough
for
six
thousand
.
we
have
ten
thousand
carts
but
we
need
other
things
as
well
we
must
manage
as
best

who
had
stared
with

at

had

inevitably
doomed

amazed
pierre
.
they
may
die
tomorrow
why
are
they
thinking
of
anything
but
death
and
by
some
latent
sequence
of
thought
the
descent
of
the
mozhdysk
hill
the
carts
with
the
wounded
the
ringing
bells
the
slanting
rays
of
the
sun
and
the
songs
of
the
cavalrymen
vividly
recurred
to
his
mind
.
the
cavalry
ride
to
battle
and
meet
the
wounded
and
do
not
for
a
moment
think
of
what
awaits
them
but
pass
by
winking
at
the
wounded
.
yet
from
among
these
men
twenty
thousand
are
doomed
to
die
and
they
wonder
at
my

strange
thought
pierre
continu
ing
his
way
to
tatarinova
.
in
front
of
a
landowners
house
to
the
left
of
the
road
stood
carriages
wagons
and
crowds
of
orderlies
and
sentinels
.
the
commander
in
chief
was
putting
up
there
but
just
when
pierre
arrived
he
was
not
in
and
hardly
any
of
the
staff
were
therethey
had
gone
to
the
church
service
.
pierre
drove
on
toward
g6rki
.
when
he
had
ascended
the
hill
and
reached
the
little
village
street
he
saw
for
the
first
time
peasant
militiamen
in
their
white
shirts
and
with
crosses
on
their
caps
who
talking
and
laughing
loudly
animated
and
perspiring
were
at
work
on
a
huge
knoll
overgrown
with
grass
to
the
right
of
the
road
.
some
of
them
were
digging
others
were
wheeling
barrowloads
of
earth
along
planks
while
others
stood
about
doing
nothing
.
two
officers
were
standing
on
the
knoll
di
recting
the
men
.
on
seeing
these
peasants
who
were
evidently
still
amused
by
the
novelty
of
their
position
as
soldiers
pierre
once
more
thought
of
the
wounded
men
at
mozhdysk
and
understood
what
the
soldier
had
meant
when
he
said
they
want
the
whole
nation
to
fall
on
them
.
the
sight
of
these
bearded
peasants
at
work
on
the
battlefield
with
their
queer
clumsy
boots
and
perspiring
necks
and
their
shirts
opening
from
the
left
toward
the
middle
unfastened
exposing
their
sunburned
collar
bones
impressed
pierre
more
strongly
with
the
solemnity
and
importance
of
the
moment
than
anything
he
had
yet
seen
or
heard
.
chapter

pierre
stepped
out
of
his
carriage
and
pass
ing
the
toiling
militiamen
ascended
the
knoll
from
which
according
to
the
doctor
the
battlefield
could
be
seen
.
it
was
about
eleven
oclock
.
the
sun
shone
somewhat
to
the
left
and
behind
him
and
brightly
lit
up
the
enormous
panorama
which
rising
like
an

extended
before
him
in

with

some

and

was

to

the
enemys
.
the
ground
to
the
right
along
the
course
of
the
kolochd
and
moskvd
rivers
was
broken
and
hilly
.
between
the
hollows
the
villages
of
bez
ziibova
and
zakhdrino
showed
in
the
distance
.
on
the
left
the
ground
was
more
level
there
were
fields
of
grain
and
the
smoking
ruins
of
semenovsk
which
had
been
burned
down
could
be
seen
.
all
that
pierre
saw
was
so
indefinite
that
neither
the
left
nor
the
right
side
of
the
field
fully
satisfied
his
expectations
.
nowhere
could
he
see
the
battlefield
he
had
expected
to
find
but
only
fields
meadows
troops
woods
the
smoke
of
campfires
villages
mounds
and
streams
and
try
as
he
would
he
could
descry
no
military
position
in
this
place
which
teemed
with
life
nor
could
he
even
distinguish
our
troops
from
the
enemys
.
i
must
ask
someone
who
knows
bethought
and
addressed
an
officer
who
was
looking
with
curiosity
at
his
huge
unmilitary
figure
.
may
i
ask
you
said
pierre
what
village
that
is
in
front
biirdino
isnt
it
said
the
officer
turning
to
his
companion
.
borodin6
the
other
corrected
him
.
the
officer
evidently
glad
of
an
opportu
nity
for
a
talk
moved
up
to
pierre
.
are
those
our
men
there
pierre
inquired
.
yes
and
there
further
on
are
the
french
said
the
officer
.
there
they
are
there

.

.

.
you
can
see

where
where
asked
pierre
.
one
can
see
them
with
the
naked
eye
.

.

.

.
why
therel
the
officer
pointed
with
his
hand
to
the
smoke
visible
on
the
left
beyond
the
river
and
the
same
stern
and
serious
expression
that
pierre
had
noticed
on
many
of
the
faces
he
had
met
came
into
his
face
.
ah
so
those
are
the
french
and
over
there

.

.

.
pierre
pointed
to
a
knoll
on
the
left
near
which
some
troops
could
be
seen
.
those
are
ours
.
ah
ours
i
and
there

.

.

.
pierre
pointed
to
another
knoll
in
the
distance
with
a
big
tree
on
it
near
a
village
that
lay
in
a
hollow
where
also
some
campfires
were
smoking
and
something
black
was
visible
.
thats
his
again
said
the
officer
.
it
was
the
shevdrdino
redoubt
.
it
was
ours
yester
day
but
now
it
is
his
then
how
about
our
position
our
position
replied
the
officer
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
.
i
can
tell
you
quite
clear
ly
because
i
constructed
nearly
all
our
en
trenchments
.
there
you
see
theres
our
cen
ter
at
borodin6
just
there
and
he
pointed
to
the
village
in
front
of
them
with
the
white
church
.
thats
where
one
crosses
the
kolocha
.
you
see
down
there
where
the
rows
of
hay
are
lying
in
the
hollow
theres
the
bridge
.
thats
our
center
.
our
right
flank
is
over
there
he
pointed
sharply
to
the
right
far
away
in
the
broken
ground
thats
where
the
moskva
river
is
and
we
have
thrown
up
three
redoubts
there
very
strong
ones
.
the
left
flank

.

.

.
here
the
officer
paused
.
well
you
see
thats
difficult
to
explain
.

.

.

.
yesterday
our
left
flank
was
there
at
shevdrdino
you
see
where
the
oak
is
but
now
we
have
withdrawn
our
left
wing
now
it
is
over
there
do
you
see
that
vil
lage
and
the
smoke
thats
semenovsk
yes
there
he
pointed
to
ravskis
knoll
.
but
the
battle
will
hardly
be
there
.
his
having
moved
his
troops
there
is
only
a
ruse
he
will
probably
pass
round
to
the
right
of
the
moskva
.
but
wherever
it
may
be
many
a
man
will
be
miss
ing
tomorrow
1
he
remarked
.
an
elderly
sergeant
who
had
approached
the
officer
while
he
was
giving
these
explanations
had
waited
in
silence
for
him
to
finish
speak
ing
but
at
this
point
evidently
not
liking
the
officers
remark
interrupted
him
.
gabions
must
be
sent
for
said
he
stern
iy
the
officer
appeared
abashed
as
though
he
understood
that
one
might
think
of
how
many
men
would
be
missing
tomorrow
but
ought
not
to
speak
of
it
.
well
send
number
three
company
again
the
officer
replied
hurriedly
.
and
you
are
you
one
of
the
doctors
no
ive
come
on
my
own
answered
pierre
and
he
went
down
the
hill
again
passing
the
militiamen
.
oh
those
damned
fellows
muttered
the
officer
who
followed
him
holding
his
nose
as
he
ran
past
the
men
at
work
.
there
they
are

.

.

.
bringing
her
coming

.

.

.
there
they
are

.

.

.
theyll
be
here
in
a
minute

.

.

.
voices
were
suddenly
heard
saying
and
officers
soldiers
and
militiamen
began
run
ning
forward
along
the
road
.
a
church
procession
was
coming
up
the
hill
from
borodim
.
first
along
the
dusty
road
came
the
infantry
in
ranks
bareheaded
and
with
arms
reversed
.
from
behind
them
came
the
sound
of
church
singing
.
soldiers
and
militiamen
ran
bareheaded
past
pierre
toward
the
procession
.
they
are
bringing
her
our
protectress

.

.

.
the
iberian
mother
of
god
someone
cried
.
the
smolensk
mother
of
god
another
corrected
him
.
the
militiamen
both
those
who
had
been
in
the
village
and
those
who
had
been
at
work
on
the
battery
threw
down
their
spades
and
ran
to
meet
the
church
procession
.
following
the
battalion
that
marched
along
the
dusty
road
came
priests
in
their
vestments
one
little
old
man
in
a
hood
with
attendants
and
singers
.
behind
them
soldiers
and
officers
bore
a
large
darkfaced
icon
with
an
embossed
metal
cover
.
this
was
the
icon
that
had
been
brought
from
smolensk
and
had
since
accompanied
the
army
.
behind
before
and
on
both
sides
crowds
of
militiamen
with
bared
heads
walked
ran
and
bowed
to
the
ground
.
at
the
summit
of
the
hill
they
stopped
with
the
icon
the
men
who
had
been
holding
it
up
by
the
linen
bands
attached
to
it
were
relieved
by
others
the
chanters
relit
their
censers
and
service
began
.
the
hot
rays
of
the
sun
beat
down
vertically
and
a
fresh
soft
wind
played
with
the
hair
of
the
bared
heads
and
with
the
ribbons
decorating
the
icon
.
the
singing
did
not
sound
loud
under
the
open
sky
.
an
im
mense
crowd
of
bareheaded
officers
soldiers
and
militiamen
surrounded
the
icon
.
behind
the
priest
and
a
chanter
stood
the
notabilities
on
a
spot
reserved
for
them
.
a
bald
general
with
a
st
.
georges
cross
on
his
neck
stood
just
be
hind
the
priests
back
and
without
crossing

war
and
peace
himself
he
was
evidently
a
german
patiently
awaited
the
end
of
the
service
which
he
con
sidered
it
necessary
to
hear
to
the
end
prob
ably
to
arouse
the
patriotism
of
the
russian
people
.
another
general
stood
in
a
martial
pose
crossing
himself
by
shaking
his
hand
in
front
of
his
chest
while
looking
about
him
.
standing
among
the
crowd
of
peasants
pierre
recognized
several
acquaintances
among
these
notables
but
did
not
look
at
them
his
whole
attention
was
absorbed
in
watching
the
serious
expression
on
the
faces
of
the
crowd
of
soldiers
and
militia
men
who
were
all
gazing
eagerly
at
the
icon
.
as
soon
as
the
tired
chanters
who
were
sing
ing
the
service
for
the
twentieth
time
that
day
began
lazily
and
mechanically
to
sing
save
from
calamity
thy
servants
o
motherof
god
and
the
priest
and
deacon
chimed
in
for
to
thee
under
god
we
all
flee
as
to
an
inviolable
bulwark
and
protection
there
again
kindled
in
all
those
faces
the
same
expression
of
con
sciousness
of
the
solemnity
of
the
impending
moment
that
pierre
had
seen
on
the
faces
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
at
mozmysk
and
momen
tarily
on
many
and
many
faces
he
had
met
that
morning
and
heads
were
bowed
more
fre
quently
and
hair
tossed
back
and
sighs
and
the
sound
men
made
as
they
crossed
themselves
were
heard
.
the
crowd
round
the
icon
suddenly
parted
and
pressed
against
pierre
.
someone
a
very
important
personage
judging
by
the
haste
with
which
way
was
made
for
him
was
approaching
the
icon
.
it
was
kutuzov
who
had
been
riding
round
the
position
and
on
his
way
back
to
tatdrino
va
had
stopped
where
the
service
was
being
held
.
pierre
recognized
him
at
once
by
his
pe
culiar
figure
which
distinguished
him
from
ev
erybody
else
.
with
a
longovercoat
on
his
exceedingly
stout
roundshouldered
body
with
uncovered
white
head
and
puffy
face
showing
the
white
ball
of
the
eye
he
had
lost
kutuzov
walked
with
plunging
swaying
gait
into
the
crowd
and
stopped
behind
the
priest
.
he
crossed
himself
with
an
accustomed
movement
bent
till
he
touched
the
ground
with
his
hand
and
bowed
his
white
head
with
a
deep
sigh
.
behind
kutu
zov
was
bennigsen
and
the
suite
.
despite
the
presence
of
the
commander
in
chief
who
at
tracted
the
attention
of
all
the
superior
officers
the
militiamen
and
soldiers
continued
their
prayers
without
looking
at
him
.
when
the
service
was
over
kutuzov
stepped
up
to
the
icon
sank
heavily
to
his
knees
bowed
to
the
ground
and
for
a
long
time
tried
vainly
to
rise
but
could
not
do
so
on
account
of
his
weakness
and
weight
.
his
white
head
twitched
with
the
effort
.
at
last
he
rose
kissed
the
icon
as
a
child
does
with
naively
pouting
lips
and
again
bowed
till
he
touched
the
ground
with
his
hand
.
the
other
generals
followed
his
ex
ample
then
the
officers
and
after
them
with
excited
faces
pressing
on
one
another
crowd
ing
panting
and
pushing
scrambled
the
sol
diers
and
militiamen
.
chapter
xxii
staggering
amid
the
crush
pierre
looked
about
him
.
count
peter
kirilovich
how
did
you
get
here
said
a
voice
.
pierre
looked
round
.
boris
drubetsk6y
brushing
his
knees
with
his
hand
he
had
probably
soiled
them
when
he
too
had
knelt
before
the
icon
came
up
to
him
smiling
.
boris
was
elegantly
dressed
with
a
slightly
martial
touch
appropriate
to
a
campaign
.
he
wore
a
long
coat
and
like
kutuzov
had
a
whip
slung
across
his
shoulder
.
meanwhile
kutuzov
had
reached
the
village
and
seated
himself
in
the
shade
of
the
nearest
house
on
a
bench
which
one
cossack
had
run
to
fetch
and
another
had
hastily
covered
with
a
rug
.
an
immense
and
brilliant
suite
surround
ed
him
.
the
icon
was
carried
further
accompanied
by
the
throng
.
pierre
stopped
some
thirty
paces
from
kutuzov
talking
to
boris
.
he
explained
his
wish
to
be
present
at
the
battle
and
to
see
the
position
.
this
is
what
you
must
do
said
boris
.
i
will
do
the
honors
of
the
camp
to
you
.
you
will
see
everything
best
from
where
count
ben
nigsen
will
be
.
i
am
in
attendance
on
him
you
know
ill
mention
it
to
him
.
but
if
you
want
to
ride
round
the
position
come
along
with
us
.
we
are
just
going
to
the
left
flank
.
then
when
we
get
back
do
spend
the
night
with
me
and
well
arrange
a
game
of
cards
.
of
course
you
know
dmitri
sergeevich
those
are
his
quar
ters
and
he
pointed
to
the
third
house
in
the
village
of
g6rki
.
but
i
should
like
to
see
the
right
flank
.
they
say
its
very
strong
said
pierre
.
i
should
like
to
start
from
the
moskva
river
and
ride
round
the
whole
position
.
well
you
can
do
that
later
but
the
chief
thing
is
the
left
flank
.
yes
yes
.
but
where
is
prince
bolk6nskis
regiment
can
you
point
it
out
to
me
book
ten
437
prince
andrews
we
shall
pass
it
and
ill
take
you
to
him
.
what
about
the
left
flank
asked
pierre
.
to
tell
you
the
truth
between
ourselves
god
only
knows
what
state
our
left
flank
is
in
said
boris
confidentially
lowering
his
voice
.
it
is
not
at
all
what
count
bennigsen
intend
ed
.
he
meant
to
fortify
that
knoll
quite
differ
ently
but

.

.

.
boris
shrugged
his
shoulders
his
serene
highness
would
not
have
it
or
someone
persuaded
him
.
you
see

.

.

.
but
boris
did
not
finish
for
at
that
moment
kaysa
rov
kutuzovs
adjutant
came
up
to
pierre
.
ah
kaysarov
said
boris
addressing
him
with
an
unembarrassed
smile
i
was
just
try
ing
to
explain
our
position
to
the
count
.
it
is
amazing
how
his
serene
highness
could
so
fore
see
the
intentions
of
the
french
you
mean
the
left
flank
asked
kaysarov
.
yes
exactly
the
left
flank
is
now
extremely
strong
.
though
kutuzov
had
dismissed
all
unneces
sary
men
from
the
staff
boris
had
contrived
to
remain
at
headquarters
after
the
changes
.
he
had
established
himself
with
count
bennigsen
who
like
all
on
whom
boris
had
been
in
at
tendance
considered
young
prince
drubet
sk6y
an
invaluable
man
.
in
the
higher
command
there
were
two
sharp
ly
defined
parties
kutuzovs
party
and
that
of
bennigsen
the
chief
of
staff
.
boris
belonged
to
the
latter
and
no
one
else
while
showing
ser
vile
respect
to
kutuzov
could
so
create
an
im
pression
that
the
old
fellow
was
not
much
good
and
that
bennigsen
managed
everything
.
now
the
decisive
moment
of
battle
had
come
when
kutuzov
would
be
destroyed
and
the
power
pass
to
bennigsen
or
even
if
kutuzov
won
the
battle
it
would
be
felt
that
everything
was
done
by
bennigsen
.
in
any
case
many
great
re
wards
would
have
to
be
given
for
tomorrows
action
and
new
men
would
come
to
the
front
.
so
boris
was
full
of
nervous
vivacity
all
day
.
after
kaysdrov
others
whom
pierre
knew
came
up
to
him
and
he
had
not
time
to
reply
to
all
the
questions
about
moscow
that
were
showered
upon
him
or
to
listen
to
all
that
was
told
him
.
the
faces
all
expressed
animation
and
apprehension
but
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
the
cause
of
the
excitement
shown
in
some
of
these
faces
lay
chiefly
in
questions
of
personal
success
his
mind
however
was
occupied
by
the
different
expression
he
saw
on
other
faces
an
expression
that
spoke
not
of
personal
matters
but
of
the
universal
questions
of
life
and
death
.
kutuzov
noticed
pierres
figure
and
the
group
gathered
round
him
.
call
him
to
me
said
kutuzov
.
an
adjutant
told
pierre
of
his
serene
high
ness
wish
and
pierre
went
toward
kutuzovs
bench
.
but
a
militiaman
got
there
before
him
.
it
was
d61okhov
.
how
did
that
fellow
get
here
asked
pierre
.
hes
a
creature
that
wriggles
in
anywhere
was
the
answer
.
he
has
been
degraded
you
know
.
now
he
wants
to
bob
up
again
.
hes
been
proposing
some
scheme
or
other
and
has
crawled
into
the
enemys
picket
line
at
night
.

.

.

.
hes
a
brave
fellow
.
pierre
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
respectful
ly
to
kutuzov
.
i
concluded
that
if
i
reported
to
your
se
rene
highness
you
might
send
me
away
or
say
that
you
knew
what
i
was
reporting
but
then
i
shouldnt
lose
anything

.

.

.
d61okhov
was
saying
.
yes
yes
.
but
if
i
were
right
i
should
be
rendering
a
service
to
my
fatherland
for
which
i
am
ready
to
die
.
yes
yes
.
and
should
your
serene
highness

repeated
his
laughing
eye
narrowing
more
and
more
as
he
looked
at

just
then
boris
with
his
courtierlike
adroit
ness
stepped
up
to
pierres
side
near
kutuzov
and
in
a
most
natural
manner
without
raising
his
voice
said
to
pierre
as
though
continuing
an
interrupted
conversation
the

have
put
on
clean
white
shirts
to
be

evidently
said
this
to

to
be

by

he

would
be
caught
by

came
up

and
took

aloud

in

at

with

half

left

pointed
out
as
being
the

of

position
and
where
rows
of
fragrant

lay
by

they
rode
across

and
came
to
a
high
knoll
where
mi
litiamen
were
digging
.
this
was
the
redoubt
as
yet
unnamed
which
afterwards
became
known
as
the
ratfvski
redoubt
or
the
knoll
battery
but
pierre
paid
no
special
attention
to
it
.
he
did
not
know
that
it
would
become
more
memorable
to
him
than
any
other
spot
on
the
plain
of
borodin6
.
they
then
crossed
the
hollow
to
semenovsk
where
the
soldiers
were
dragging
away
the
last
logs
from
the
huts
and
barns
.
then
they
rode
downhill
and
uphill
across
a
rycfield
trodden
and
beaten
down
as
if
by
hail
following
a
track
freshly
made
by
the
artillery
over
the
fur
rows
of
the
plowed
land
and
reached
some
fleches
a
which
were
still
being
dug
.
at
the
fleches
bennigsen
stopped
and
began
looking
at
the
shevdrdino
redoubt
opposite
which
had
been
ours
the
day
before
and
where
several
horsemen
could
be
descried
.
the
offi
cers
said
that
either
napoleon
or
murat
was
there
and
they
all
gazed
eagerly
at
this
little
group
of
horsemen
.
pierre
also
looked
at
them
trying
to
guess
which
of
the
scarcely
discernible
figures
was
napoleon
.
at
last
those
mounted
men
rode
away
from
the
mound
and
disap
peared
.
bennigsen
spoke
to
a
general
who
ap
proached
him
and
began
explaining
the
whole
position
of
our
troops
.
pierre
listened
to
him
straining
each
faculty
to
understand
the
es
sential
points
of
the
impending
battle
but
was
mortified
to
feel
that
his
mental
capacity
was
inadequate
for
the
task
.
he
could
make
noth
ing
of
it
.
bennigsen
stopped
speaking
and
noticing
that
pierre
was
listening
suddenly
said
to
him
i
dont
think
this
interests
you
on
the
contrary
its
very
interesting
re
plied
pierre
not
quite
truthfully
.
from
the
fleches
they
rode
still
farther
to
the
left
along
a
road
winding
through
a
thick
lowgrowing
birch
wood
.
in
the
middle
of
the
wood
a
brown
hare
with
white
feet
sprang
out
and
scared
by
the
tramp
of
the
many
horses
grew
so
confused
that
it
leaped
along
the
road
in
front
of
them
for
some
time
arousing
gen
eral
attention
and
laughter
and
only
when
sev
eral
voices
shouted
at
it
did
it
dart
to
one
side
and
disappear
in
the
thicket
.
after
going
through
the
wood
for
about
a
mile
and
a
half
they
came
out
on
a
glade
where
troops
of
tiich
kovs
corps
were
stationed
to
defend
the
left
flank
.

talked
a
great
deal
and
with
much
heat
and
as
it
seemed
to
pierre
gave
orders
of
great
mil
itary
importance
.
in
front
of
tuchkovs
troops
was
some
high
ground
not
occupied
by
troops
.
bennigsen
loudly
criticized
this
mistake
say
ing
that
it
was
madness
to
leave
a
height
which
commanded
the
country
around
unoccupied
and
to
place
troops
below
it
.
some
of
the
gen
erals
expressed
the
same
opinion
.
one
in
par
ticular
declared
with
martial
heat
that
they
were
put
there
to
be
slaughtered
.
bennigsen
on
his
own
authority
ordered
the
troops
to
occu
py
the
high
ground
.
this
disposition
on
the
left
flank
increased
pierres
doubt
of
his
own
capacity
to
understand
military
matters
.
lis
tening
to
bennigsen
and
the
generals
criticiz
ing
the
position
of
the
troops
behind
the
hill
he
quite
understood
them
and
shared
their
opinion
but
for
that
very
reason
he
could
not
understand
how
the
man
who
put
them
there
behind
the
hill
could
have
made
so
gross
and
palpable
a
blunder
.
pierre
did
not
know
that
these
troops
were
not
as
bennigsen
supposed
put
there
to
de
fend
the
position
but
were
in
a
concealed
po
sition
as
an
ambush
that
they
should
not
be
seen
and
might
be
able
to
strike
an
approaching
enemy
unexpectedly
.
bennigsen
did
not
know
this
and
moved
the
troops
forward
according
to
his
own
ideas
without
mentioning
the
mat
ter
to
the
commander
in
chief
.

princc

lay
leaning
on

elbow
in
a
broken
down
shed
in
the
village
of

at
the
further
end
of

.
through
a
gap
in
the
broken
wall
he
could
see
beside
the
wooden
fence
a
row
of
thirty
yearold
birches
with
their
lower
branches
lopped
off
a
field
on
which

were
standing

bushes
near
which
rose

and
useless

his

to
him
prince

drew
on
the
eve
of

felt
agitated
and
ir

as
he
had
done
seven
years
before
at
austerlitz
.
he
had
received
and
given
the
orders
for

and
had
nothing
more
to
do
.
but
his
thoughts
the
simplest
clearest
and
therefore
most
terrible
thoughts
would
give
him
no
peace
.
he
knew
that
tomorrows
battle
would
be
the
most
terrible
of
all
he
had
taken
part
in
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
pos
sibility
of
death
presented
itself
to
him

in

to
any
worldly
matter
or
with
ref
erence
to
its
effect
on
others
but
simply
in
re
lation
to
himself
to
his
own
soul
vividly
plainly
terribly
and
almost
as
a
certainty
.
and
from
the
height
of
this
perception
all
that
had
previously
tormented
and
preoccupied
him
suddenly
became
illumined
by
a
cold
white
light
without
shadows
without
perspective
and
without
distinction
of
outline
.
all
life
appeared
to
him
like
magiclantern
pictures
at
which
he
had
long
been
gazing
by
artificial
light
through
a
glass
.
now
he
suddenly
saw
those
badly
daubed
pictures
in
clear
daylight
and
without
a
glass
.
yes
yes
there
they
are
those
false
images
that
agitated
enraptured
and
tormented
me
said
he
to
himself
passing
in
review
the
princi
pal
pictures
of
the
magic
lantern
of
life
and
regarding
them
now
in
the
cold
white
daylight
of
his
clear
perception
of
death
.
there
they
are
those
rudely
painted
figures
that
once
seemed
splendid
and
mysterious
.

how
important
these
pictures
appeared
to
me
with
what
profound
meaning
they
seemed
to
be
filled
and
it
is
all
so
simple
pale
and
crude
in
the
cold
white
light
of
this
morn
ing
which
i
feel
is
dawning
for
me

the
three
great
sorrows
ot

life
held
his

his
love
for

and

with

oh
what
a

i
was
he
said
aloud
bitterly

ah

i
believed
in
some
ideal
love
which
was
to
keep
her
faithful
to
me
for
the
whole
year
of
my
absence

the
gentle

in

was

was

father
built

place

came
and
swept
him
aside
un

of

existence
as
lie
might
brush
a
chip
from
his
path
and
his

hills
and
his

with

and

the
curly
clouds

smoke
of

campfires

all
that
was
around

and
seemed

ran
down

spine

out
of

and
began
to

rose
hastily
listened
to
the
business
they
had
come
about
gave
them
some
further
instructions
and
was
about
to
dismiss
them
when
he
heard
a
familiar
lisping
voice
behind
the
shed
.
devil
take
it
said
the
voice
of
a
man
stumbling
over
something
.
prince
andrew
looked
out
of
the
shed
and
saw
pierre
who
had
tripped
over
a
pole
on
the
ground
and
had
nearly
fallen
coming
his
way
.
it
was
unpleasant
to
prince
andrew
to
meet
people
of
his
own
set
in
general
and
pierre
especially
for
he
reminded
him
of
all
the
pain
ful
moments
of
his
last
visit
to
moscow
.
you
what
a
surprise
said
he
.
what
brings
you
here
this
is
unexpected
as
he
said
this
his
eyes
and
face
expressed
more
than
coldness
they
expressed
hostility
which
pierre
noticed
at
once
.
he
had
ap
proached
the
shed
full
of
animation
but
on
seeing
prince
andrews
face
he
felt
constrained
and
ill
at
ease
.
i
have
come

.

.
simply

.

.

.
you

said

who
had
so
often
that

senselessly
repeated

.
oh
yes
and
what
do
the

say
about

how
would

stop
it
said
prince

sarcastically
.
well
and
hows

and
my
people
have
they
reached
moscow

he
asked
seriously

so

went

chapter

the
officers
were
about
to
take
leave
but
prince
andrew
apparently
reluctant
to
be
left
alone
with
his
friend
asked
them
to
stay
and
have
tea
.
seats
were
brought
in
and
so
was
the
tea
.
the
officers
gazed
with
surprise
at
pierres
huge
stout
figure
and
listened
to
his
talk
of
moscow
and
the
position
of
our
army
round
which
he
had
ridden
.
prince
andrew
remained
silent
and
his
expression
was
so
forbidding
that
pierre
addressed
his
remarks
chiefly
to
ti
m6khin
the
goodnatured
battalion
com
mander
.
so
you
understand
the
whole
position
of
our
troops
prince
andrew
interrupted
him

that
is
how
do
you
mean
said

not

i
have
understood
it
fully
but
i
understand
the
gen
eral
position
.
well
then
you
know
more
than
anyone
else
be
it
who
it
may
said
prince
andrew
.
oh
said
pierre
looking
over
his
spectacles
in
perplexity
at
prince
andrew
.
well
and
what
do
you
think
of
kutiizovs
appointment
he
asked
.
i
was
very
glad
of
his
appointment
thats
all
i
know
replied
prince
andrew
.
and
tell
me
your
opinion
of
barclay
de
tolly
.
in
moscow
they
are
saying
heaven
knows
what
about
him
.

.

.

.
what
do
you
think
of
him
ask
them
replied
prince
andrew
indicat
ing
the
officers
.
pierre
looked
at
timokhin
with
the
conde
scendingly
interrogative
smile
with
which
ev
erybody
involuntarily
addressed
that
officer
.
we
see
light
again
since
his
serenity
has
been
appointed
your
excellency
said
timo
khin
timidly
and
continually
turning
to
glance
at
his
colonel
.
why
so
asked
pierre
.
well
to
mention
only
firewood
and
fodder
let
me
inform
you
.
why
when
we
were
retreat
ing
from
sventsyani
we
dare
not
touch
a
stick
or
a
wisp
of
hay
or
anything
.
you
see
we
were
going
away
so
he
would
get
it
all
wasnt
it
so
your
excellency
and
again
tim6khin
turned
to
the
prince
.
but
we
darent
.
in
our
regi
ment
two
officers
were
courtmartialed
for
that
kind
of
thing
.
but
when
his
serenity
took
com
mand
every
thing
became
straightforward
.
now
we
see
light
.

.

.

.
then
why
was
it
forbidden
book
ten
441
tim6khin
looked
about
in
confusion
not
knowing
what
or
how
to
answer
such
a
ques
tion
.
pierre
put
the
same
question
to
prince
andrew
.
why
so
as
not
to
lay
waste
the
country
we
were
abandoning
to
the
enemy
said
prince
andrewwith
venomous
irony
.
it
is
very
sound
one
cant
permit
the
land
to
be
pillaged
and
ac
custom
the
troops
to
marauding
.
at
smolensk
too
he
judged
correctly
that
the
french
might
outflank
us
as
they
had
larger
forces
.
but
he
could
not
understand
this
cried
prince
an
drew
in
a
shrill
voice
that
seemed
to
escape
him
involuntarily
he
could
not
understand
that
there
for
the
first
time
we
were
fighting
for
russian
soil
and
that
there
was
a
spirit
in
the
men
such
as
i
had
never
seen
before
that
we
had
held
the
french
for
two
days
and
that
that
success
had
increased
ourstrength
tenfold
.
he
ordered
us
to
retreat
and
all
our
efforts
and
losses
went
for
nothing
.
he
had
no
thought
of
betraying
us
he
tried
to
do
the
best
he
could
he
thought
out
everything
and
that
is
why
he
is
unsuitable
.
he
is
unsuitable
now
just
because
he
plans
out
everything
very
thor
oughly
and
accurately
as
every
german
has
to
.
how
can
i
explain

.

.

.
well
say
your
father
has
a
german
valet
and
he
is
a
splendid
valet
and
satisfies
your
fathers
requirements
better
than
you
could
then
its
all
right
to
let
him
serve
.
but
if
your
father
is
mortally
sick
youll
send
the
valet
away
and
attend
to
your
father
with
your
own
un
practiced
awkward
hands
and
will
soothe
him
better
than
a
skilled
man
who
is
a
stranger
could
.
so
it
has
been
with
barclay
.
while
russia
was
well
a
foreigner
could
serve
her
and
be
a
splendid
minister
but
as
soon
as
she
is
in
danger
she
needs
one
of
her
own
kin
.
but
in
your
club
they
have
been
mak
ing
him
out
a
traitor
they
slander
him
as
a
traitor
and
the
only
result
will
be
that
after
wards
ashamed
of
their
false
accusations
they
will
make
him
out
a
hero
or
a
genius
instead
of
a
traitor
and
that
will
be
still
more
unjust
.
he
is
an
honest
and
very
punctilious
german
.
and
they
say
hes
a
skillful
commander
rejoined
pierre
.
i
dont
understand
what
is
meant
by
a
skill
ful
commander
replied
prince
andrew
iron
ically
.
a
skillful
commander
replied
pierre
.
why
one
who
foresees
all
contingencies

.

.

.
and
foresees
the
adversarys
intentions
.
but
thats
impossible
said
prince
andrew
as
if
it
were
a
matter
settled
long
ago
.
pierre
looked
at
him
in
surprise
.
and
yet
they
say
that
war
is
like
a
game
of
chess
he
remarked
.
yes
replied
prince
andrew
but
with
this
little
difference
that
in
chess
you
may
think
over
each
move
as
long
as
you
please
and
are
not
limited
for
time
and
with
this
difference
too
that
a
knight
is
always
stronger
than
a
pawn
and
two
pawns
are
always
stronger
than
one
while
in
war
a
battalion
is
sometimes
stronger
than
a
division
and
sometimes
weaker
than
a
company
.
the
relative
strength
of
bodies
of
troops
can
never
be
known
to
any
one
.
believe
me
he
went
on
if
things
de
pended
on
arrangements
made
by
the
staff
i
should
be
there
making
arrangements
but
in
stead
of
that
i
have
the
honor
to
serve
here
in
the
regiment
with
these
gentlemen
and
i
con
sider
that
on
us
tomorrows
battle
will
depend
and
not
on
those
others
.

.

.

.
success
never
de
pends
and
never
will
depend
on
position
or
equipment
or
even
on
numbers
and
least
of
all
on
position
.
but
on
what
then
on
the
feeling
that
is
in
me
and
in
him
he
pointed
to
tim6khin
and
in
each
soldier
.
prince
andrew
glanced
at
timokhin
who
looked
at
his
commander
in
alarm
and
bewil
derment
.
in
contrast
to
his
former
reticent
taci
turnity
prince
andrew
now
seemed
excited
.
he
could
apparently
not
refrain
from
express
ing
the
thoughts
that
had
suddenly
occurred
to
him
.
a
battle
is
won
by
those
who
firmly
resolve
to
win
it
why
did
we
lose
the
battle
at
auster
litz
the
french
losses
were
almost
equal
to
ours
but
very
early
we
said
to
ourselves
that
we
were
losing
the
battle
and
we
did
lose
it
.
and
we
said
so
because
we
had
nothing
to
fight
for
there
we
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
battle
field
as
soon
as
we
could
.
weve
lost
so
let
us
run
and
we
ran
.
if
we
had
not
said
that
till
the
evening
heaven
knows
what
might
not
have
happened
.
but
tomorrow
we
shant
say
it
you
talk
about
our
position
the
left
flank
weak
and
the
right
flank
too
extended
he
went
on
.
thats
all
nonsense
theres
nothing
of
the
kind
.
but
what
awaits
us
tomorrow
a
hundred
million
most
diverse
chances
which
will
be
decided
on
the
instant
by
the
fact
that
our
men
or
theirs
run
or
do
not
run
and
that
this
man
or
that
man
is
killed
but
all
that
is
being
done
at
present
is
only
play
.
the
fact
is
that
those
men
with
whom
you
have
ridden
round
the
position
not
only
do
not
help
mat
ters
but
hinder
.
they
are
only
concerned
with
their
own
petty
interests
.
44
war
and
peace
at
such
a
moment
said
pierre
reproach
fully
.
at
such
a
moment
prince
andrew
re
peated
.
to
them
it
is
only
a
moment
afford
ing
opportunities
to
undermine
a
rival
and
ob
tain
an
extra
cross
or
ribbon
.
for
me
tomorrow
means
this
a
russian
army
of
a
hundred
thou
sand
and
a
french
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
have
met
to
fight
and
the
thing
is
that
these
two
hundred
thousand
men
will
fight
and
the
side
that
fights
more
fiercely
and
spares
itself
least
will
win
.
and
if
you
like
i
will
tell
you
that
whatever
happens
and
whatever
muddles
those
at
the
top
may
make
we
shall
win
to
morrows
battle
.
tomorrow
happen
what
may
we
shall
win
there
now
your
excellency
thats
the
truth
the
real
truth
said
tim6khin
.
who
would
spare
himself
now
the
soldiers
in
my
battalion
believe
me
wouldnt
drink
their
vodka
its
not
the
day
for
that
they
say
.
all
were
silent
.
the
officers
rose
.
prince
an
drew
went
out
of
the
shed
with
them
giving
final
orders
to
the
adjutant
.
after
they
had
gone
pierre
approached
prince
andrew
and
was
about
to
start
a
conversation
when
they
heard
theclatter
of
three
horses
hoof
son
the
road
not
far
from
the
shed
and
looking
in
that
direction
prince
andrew
recognized
wolzogen
and
clausewitz
accompanied
by
a
cossack
.
they
rode
close
by
continuing
to
converse
and
prince
andrew
involuntarily
heard
these
words
der
krieg
muss
in
raum
verlegt
werden
.
der
ansicht
kann
ich
nicht
genug
preis
ge
ben
l
said
one
of
them
.
oh
ja
said
the
other
der
zweck
ist
nur
den
feind
zu
schwtichen
so
kann
man
gewiss
nicht
den
verlust
der
priv
atpersonen
in
ach
tung
nehmen
.

oh
no
agreed
the
other
.
extend
widely
said
prince
andrew
with
an
angry
snort
when
they
had
ridden
past
.
in
that
extend
were
my
father
son
and
sis
ter
at
bald
hills
.
thats
all
the
same
to
him
thats
what
i
was
saying
to
youthose
german
gentlemen
wont
win
the
battle
tomorrow
but
will
only
make
all
the
mess
they
can
because
they
have
nothing
in
their
german
heads
but
theories
not
worth
an
empty
eggshell
and
havent
in
their
hearts
the
one
thing
needed
to
14
the
war
must
be
extended
widely
.
i
cannot
sufficiently
commend
that
view
.

oh
yes
the
only
aim
is
to
weaken
the
enemy
so
of
course
one
cannot
take
into
account
the
loss
of
private
individuals
.
morrow
that
which
timokhin
has
.
they
have
yielded
up
all
europe
to
him
f
and
have
now
come
to
teach
us
.
fine
teachers
and
again
his
voice
grew
shrill
.
so
you
think
we
shall
win
tomorrows
bat
tle
asked
pierre
.
yes
yes
answered
prince
andrew
absent
ly
.
one
thing
i
would
do
if
i
had
the
power
he
began
again
i
would
not
take
prisoners
.
why
take
prisoners
its
chivalry
the
french
have
destroyed
my
home
and
are
on
their
way
to
destroy
moscow
they
have
outraged
and
are
outraging
me
every
moment
.
they
are
my
ene
mies
.
in
my
opinion
they
are
all
criminals
.
and
so
thinks
timokhin
and
the
whole
army
.
they
should
be
executed
since
they
are
my
foes
they
cannot
be
my
friends
whatever
may
have
been
said
at
tilsit
.
yes
yes
muttered
pierre
looking
with
shining
eyes
at
prince
andrew
.
i
quite
agree
with
you
the
question
that
had
perturbed
pierre
on
the
mozhdysk
hill
and
all
that
day
now
seemed
to
him
quite
clear
and
completely
solved
.
he
now
understood
the
whole
meaning
and
im
portance
of
this
war
and
of
the
impending
bat
tle
.
all
he
had
seen
that
day
all
the
significant
and
stern
expressions
on
the
faces
he
had
seen
in
passing
were
lit
up
for
him
by
a
new
light
.
he
understood
that
latent
heat
as
they
say
in
physics
of
patriotism
which
was
present
in
all
these
men
he
had
seen
and
this
explained
to
him
why
they
all
prepared
for
death
calmly
and
as
it
were
lightheartedly
.
not
take
prisoners
prince
andrew
con
tinued
that
by
itself
would
quite
change
the
whole
war
and
make
it
less
cruel
.
as
it
is
we
have
played
at
war
thats
whats
vile
we
play
at
magnanimity
and
all
that
stuff
.
such
magna
nimity
and
sensibility
are
like
the
magnanimity
and
sensibility
of
a
lady
who
faints
when
she
sees
a
calf
being
killed
she
is
so
kindhearted
that
she
cant
look
at
blood
but
enjoys
eat
ing
the
calf
served
up
with
sauce
.
they
talk
to
us
of
the
rules
of
war
of
chivalry
of
flags
of
truce
of
mercy
to
the
unfortunate
and
so
on
.
its
all
rubbish
i
saw
chivalry
and
flags
of
truce
in
1805
they
humbugged
us
and
we
hum
bugged
them
.
they
plunder
other
peoples
houses
issue
false
paper
money
and
worst
of
all
they
kill
my
children
and
my
father
and
then
talk
of
rules
of
war
and
magnanimity
to
foes
take
no
prisoners
but
kill
and
be
killed
he
who
has
come
to
this
as
i
have
through
the
same
sufferings

..
.
prince
andrew
who
had
thought
it
was
all
book
ten
443
the
same
to
him
whether
or
not
moscow
was
taken
as
smolensk
had
been
was
suddenly
checked
in
his
speech
by
an
unexpected
cramp
in
his
throat
.
he
paced
up
and
down
a
few
times
in
silence
but
his
eyes
glittered
feverish
ly
and
his
lips
quivered
as
he
began
speaking
.
if
there
was
none
of
this
magnanimity
in
war
we
should
go
to
war
only
when
it
was
worth
while
going
to
certain
death
as
now
.
then
there
would
not
be
war
because
paul
ivdnovich
had
offended
michael
ivnovich
.
and
when
there
was
a
war
like
this
one
it
would
be
warl
and
then
the
detennination
of
the
troops
would
be
quite
different
.
then
all
these
westphalians
and
hessians
whom
na
poleon
is
leading
would
not
follow
him
into
russia
and
we
should
not
go
to
fight
in
aus
tria
and
prussia
without
knowing
why
.
war
is
not
courtesy
but
the
most
horrible
thing
in
life
and
we
ought
to
understand
that
and
not
play
at
war
.
we
ought
to
accept
this
terrible
necessity
sternly
and
seriously
.
it
all
lies
in
that
get
rid
of
falsehood
and
let
war
be
war
and
not
a
game
.
as
it
is
now
war
is
the
favor
ite
pastime
of
the
idle
and
frivolous
.
the
mili
tary
calling
is
the
most
highly
honored
.
but
what
is
war
what
is
needed
for
suc
cess
in
warfare
what
are
the
habits
of
the
military
the
aim
of
war
is
murder
the
meth
ods
of
war
are
spying
treachery
and
their
en
couragement
the
ruin
of
a
countrys
inhabit
ants
robbing
them
or
stealing
to
provision
the
army
and
fraud
and
falsehood
termed
mili
tary
craft
.
the
habits
of
the
military
class
are
the
absence
of
freedom
that
is
discipline
idle
ness
ignorance
cruelty
debauchery
and
drunkenness
.
and
in
spite
of
all
this
it
is
the
highest
class
respected
by
everyone
.
all
the
kings
except
the
chinese
wear
military
uni
forms
and
he
who
kills
most
people
receives
the
highest
rewards
.
they
meet
as
we
shall
meet
tomorrow
to
murder
one
another
they
kill
and
maim
tens
of
thousands
and
then
have
thanksgiving
serv
ices
for
having
killed
so
many
people
they
even
exaggerate
the
number
and
they
an
nounce
a
victory
supposing
that
the
more
peo
ple
they
have
killed
the
greater
their
achieve
ment
.
how
does
god
above
look
at
them
and
hear
them
exclaimed
prince
andrew
in
a
shrill
piercing
voice
.
ah
my
friend
it
has
of
late
become
hard
for
me
to
live
.
i
see
that
i
have
begun
to
understand
too
much
.
and
it
doesnt
do
for
man
to
taste
of
the
tree
of
knowl
edge
of
good
and
evil
.

.

.

.
ah
well
its
not
for
longl
he
added
.
however
youre
sleepy
and
its
time
for
me
to
sleep
.
go
back
to
g6rkil
said
prince
andrew
suddenly
.
oh
nol
pierre
replied
looking
at
prince
andrew
with
frightened
compassionate
eyes
.
go
gol
before
a
battle
one
must
have
ones
sleep
out
repeated
prince
andrew
.
he
came
quickly
up
to
pierre
and
embraced
and
kissed
him
.
goodby
be
offl
he
shouted
.
whether
we
meet
again
or
not

.

.

.
and
turning
away
hurriedly
he
entered
the
shed
.
it
was
already
dark
and
pierre
could
not
make
out
whether
the
expression
of
prince
andrews
face
was
angry
or
tender
.
for
some
time
he
stood
in
silence
consider
ing
whether
he
should
follow
him
or
go
away
.
no
he
does
not
want
itl
pierre
concluded
.
and
i
know
that
this
is
our
last
meeting
he
sighed
deeply
and
rode
back
to
g6rki
.
on
reentering
the
shed
prince
andrew
lay
down
on
a
rug
but
he
could
not
sleep
.
he
closed
his
eyes
.
one
picture
succeeded
another
in
his
imagination
.
on
one
of
them
he
dwelt
long
and
joyfully
.
he
vividly
recalled
an
evening
in
petersburg
.
natdsha
with
animated
and
excited
face
was
telling
him
how
she
had
gone
to
look
for
mushrooms
the
previous
sum
mer
and
had
lost
her
way
in
the
big
forest
.
she
incoherently
described
the
depths
of
the
forest
her
feelings
and
a
talk
with
a
beekeeper
she
met
and
constantly
interrupted
her
story
to
say
no
i
cant
im
not
telling
it
right
no
you
dont
understand
though
he
encouraged
her
by
saying
that
he
did
understand
and
he
really
had
understood
all
she
wanted
to
say
.
but
natasha
was
not
satisfied
with
her
own
words
she
felt
that
they
did
not
convey
the
passionately
poetic
feeling
she
had
experi
enced
that
day
and
wished
to
convey
.
he
was
such
a
delightful
old
man
and
it
was
so
dark
in
the
forest

.

.

.
and
he
had
such
kind

.

.

.
no
i
cant
describe
it
she
had
said
flushed
and
excited
.
prince
andrew
smiled
now
the
same
happy
smile
as
then
when
he
had
looked
into
her
eyes
.
i
understood
her
he
thought
.
i
not
only
understood
her
but
it
was
just
that
inner
spiritual
force
that
sincerity
that
frank
ness
of
soulthat
very
soul
of
hers
which
seemed
to
be
fettered
by
her
body
it
was
that
soul
i
loved

her

loved
so
strongly
and
happily

.

.

.
and
suddenly
he
remembered
how
his
love
had
ended
.
he
did
not
need
anything
of
that
kind
.
he
neither
saw
nor
understood
anything
of
the
sort
.
he
only
saw
in
her
a
pretty
and
fresh
young
girl
with
whom
he
did

not

still
alive
and
gay
prince

jumped
upas
if
someone
had

began
pacing
up

down

of
the

of

arrived
at

from

and
the
latter
from

donning
his
court
uniform
m
.
de
beausset
ordered
a
box
he
had
brought
for
the
emperor
to
be
carried
before
him
and
entered
the
first
compartment
of
napoleons
tent
where
he
be
gan
opening
the
boxwhile
conversingwith
na
poleons
aidesdecamp
who
surrounded
him
.
fabvier
not
entering
the
tent
remained
at
the
entrance
talking
to
some
generals
of
his
acquaintance
.
the
emperor
napoleon
had
not
yet
left
his
bedroom
and
was
finishing
his
toilet
.
slightly
snorting
and
grunting
he
presented
now
his
back
and
now
his
plump
hairy
chest
to
the
brush
with
which
his
valet
was
rubbing
him
down
.
another
valet
with
his
finger
over
the
mouth
of
a
bottle
was
sprinkling
eau
de
co
logne
on
the
emperors
pampered
body
with
an
expression
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
alone
knew
where
and
how
much
eau
de
co
logne
should
be
sprinkled
.
napoleons
short
hair
was
wet
and
matted
on
the
forehead
but
his
face
though
puffy
and
yellow
expressed
physical
satisfaction
.
go
on
harder
go
onl
he
muttered
to
the
valet
who
was
rubbing
him
slightly
twitching
and
grunting
.
an
aidede
camp
who
had
entered
the
bedroom
to
report
to
the
emperor
the
number
of
prisoners
taken
in
yesterdays
action
was
standing
by
the
door
after
delivering
his
message
awaiting
permis
sion
to
withdraw
.
napoleon
frowning
looked
at
him
from
under
his
brows
.
no
prisoners
said
he
repeating
the
aide
decamps
words
.
they
are
forcing
us
to
exter
minate
them
.
so
much
the
worse
for
the
rus
sian
army

..
.
go

..
.
harder
harder
he
muttered
hunching
his
back
and
presenting
his
fat
shoulders
.
all
right
.
let
monsieur
de
beausset
enter
and
fabvier
too
he
said
nodding
to
the
aide
decamp
.
yes
sire
and
the
aidedecamp
disappeared
through
the
door
of
the
tent
.
two
valets
rapidly
dressed
his
majesty
and
wearing
the
blue
uniform
of
the
guards
he
war
and
peace
and
he
went
with
firm
quick
steps
to
the
reception
room
.
de
beaussets
hands
meanwhile
were
busily
engaged
arranging
the
present
he
had
brought
from
the
empress
on
two
chairs
directly
in
front
of
the
entrance
.
but
napoleon
had
dressed
and
come
out
with
such
unexpected
ra
pidity
that
he
had
not
time
to
finish
arranging
the
surprise
.
napoleon
noticed
at
once
what
they
were
about
and
guessed
that
they
were
not
ready
.
he
did
not
wish
to
deprive
them
of
the
pleas
ure
of
giving
him
a
surprise
so
he
pretended
not
to
see
de
beausset
and
called
fabvier
to
him
listening
silently
and
with
a
stern
frown
to
what
fabvier
told
him
of
the
heroism
and
devotion
of
his
troops
fighting
at
salamanca
at
the
other
end
of
europe
with
but
one
thought
to
be
worthy
of
their
emperor
and
but
one
fear
to
fail
to
please
him
.
the
result
of
that
battle
had
been
deplorable
.
napoleon
made
ironic
remarks
during
fabviers
account
as
if
he
had
not
expected
that
matters
could
go
otherwise
in
his
absence
.
i
must
make
up
for
that
in
moscow
said
napoleon
.
ill
see
you
later
he
added
and
summoned
de
beausset
who
by
that
time
had
prepared
the
surprise
having
placed
something
on
the
chairs
and
covered
it
with
a
cloth
.
de
beausset
bowed
low
with
that
courtly
french
bow
which
only
the
old
retainers
of
the
bourbons
knew
how
to
make
and
ap
preached
him
presenting
an
envelope
.
napoleon
turned
to
him
gaily
and
pulled
his
ear
.
you
have
hurried
here
.
i
am
very
glad
.
well
what
is
paris
saying
he
asked
suddenly
changing
his
former
stern
expression
fora
most
cordial
tone
.
sire
all
paris
regrets
your
absence
re
plied
de
beausset
as
was
proper
.
but
though
napoleon
knew
that
de
beaus
set
had
to
say
something
of
this
kind
and
though
in
his
lucid
moments
he
knew
it
was
untrue
he
was
pleased
to
hear
it
from
him
.
again
he
honored
him
by
touching
his
ear
.
i
am
very
sorry
to
have
made
you
travel
so
far
said
he
.
sire
i
expected
nothing
less
than
to
find
you
at
the
gates
of
moscow
replied
de
beaus
set
.
napoleon
smiled
and
lifting
his
head
absent
mindedly
glanced
to
the
right
.
an
aidedecamp
approached
with
gliding
steps
and
offered
him
a
gold
snuffbox
which
he
took
.
yes
it
has
happened
luckily
for
you
he
book
ten
445
said
raising
the
open
snuffbox
to
his
nose
.
you
are
fond
of
travel
and
in
three
days
you
will
see
moscow
.
you
surely
did
not
expect
to
see
that
asiatic
capital
.
you
will
have
a
pleas
ant
journey
.
de
beausset
bowed
gratefully
at
this
regard
for
his
taste
for
travel
of
which
he
had
not
till
then
been
aware
.
ha
whats
this
asked
napoleon
noticing
that
all
the
courtiers
were
looking
at
some
thing
concealed
under
a
cloth
.
with
courtly
adroitness
de
beausset
half
turned
and
without
turning
his
back
to
the
emperor
retired
two
steps
twitching
off
the
cloth
at
the
same
time
and
said
a
present
to
your
majesty
from
the
em
press
.
it
was
a
portrait
painted
in
bright
colors
by
gerard
of
the
son
idorne
to
napoleon
by
the
daughter
of
the
emperor
of
austria
the
boy
whom
for
some
reason
everyone
called
the
king
of
rome
.
a
very
pretty
curlyheaded
boy
with
a
look
of
the
christ
in
the
sistine
madonna
was
de
picted
playing
at
stick
and
ball
.
the
ball
rep
resented
the
terrestrial
globe
and
the
stick
in
his
other
hand
a
scepter
.
though
it
was
not
clear
what
the
artist
meant
to
express
by
depicting
the
socalled
king
of
rome
spiking
the
earth
with
a
stick
the
alle
gory
apparently
seemed
to
napoleon
as
it
had
done
to
all
who
had
seen
it
in
paris
quite
clear
and
very
pleasing
.
the
king
of
rome
he
said
pointing
to
the
portrait
with
a
graceful
gesture
.
admi
rable
with
the
natural
capacity
of
an
italian
for
changing
the
expression
of
his
face
at
will
he
drew
nearer
to
the
portrait
and
assumed
a
look
of
pensive
tenderness
.
he
felt
that
what
he
now
said
and
did
would
be
historical
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
would
now
be
best
for
him
whose
grandeur
enabled
his
son
to
play
stick
and
ball
with
the
terrestrial
globe
to
show
in
contrast
to
that
grandeur
the
sim
plest
paternal
tenderness
.
his
eyes
grew
dim
he
moved
forward
glanced
round
at
a
chair
which
seemed
to
place
itself
under
him
and
sat
down
on
it
before
the
portrait
.
at
a
single
gesture
from
him
everyone
went
out
on
tiptoe
leaving
the
great
man
to
himself
and
his
emo
tion
.
having
sat
still
for
a
while
he
touched
him
self
not
knowing
why
the
thick
spot
of
paint
representing
the
highest
light
in
the
portrait
rose
and
recalled
de
beausset
and
the
officer
on
duty
.
he
ordered
the
portrait
to
be
carried
outside
his
tent
that
the
old
guard
stationed
round
it
might
not
be
deprived
of
the
pleas
ure
of
seeing
the
king
of
rome
the
son
and
heir
of
their
adored
monarch
.
and
while
lie
was
doing
m
.
de
beausset
the
honor
of
breakfasting
with
him
they
heard
as
napoleon
had
anticipated
the
rapturous
cries
of
the
officers
and
men
of
the
old
guard
who
had
run
up
to
see
the
portrait
.

came
those
ecstatic
cries
.
after
breakfast
napoleon
in
de
beaussets
presence
dictated
his
order
of
the
day
to
the
army
.

and

when
he

who
was
so
fond

to
accompany

ride
he
went
out

tent

where
the
horses
stood
sad
dled
.
your

replied
de

the

he

not

how

and
was
afraid

doing
so
.
but
napoleon
nodded
to
the
traveler
and
de
beausset
had
to
mount
.
when
napoleon
came
out
of
the
tent
theshouting
of

grew
still
louder

na

away
he
said
pointing
with
a
gracefully
majestic
gesture
to
the
portrait
.
it
is
too
soon
for
him
to
see
a
field
of
battle
.
de
beausset
closed
his
eyes
bowed
his
head
and
sighed
deeply
to
indicate
how
profoundly
he
valued
and
comprehended
the
emperors
words
.
chapter
xxvii
on
the
twentyfifth
of
august
so
his
histo
rians
tell
us
napoleon
spent
the
whole
day
on
horseback
inspecting
the
locality
considering
plans
submitted
to
him
by
his
marshals
and
personally
giving
commands
to
his
generals

war
and
peace
the
original
line
of
the
russian
forces
along
the
river
kolocha
had
been
dislocated
by
the
capture
of
the
shevdrdino
redoubt
on
the
twentyfourth
and
part
of
the
linethe
left
flank
had
been
drawn
back
.
that
part
of
the
line
was
not
entrenched
and
in
front
of
it
the
ground
was
more
open
and
level
than
else
where
.
it
was
evident
to
anyone
military
or
not
that
it
was
here
the
french
should
attack
.
it
would
seem
that
not
much
consideration
was
needed
to
reach
this
conclusion
nor
any
particular
care
or
trouble
on
the
part
of
the
emperor
and
his
marshals
nor
was
there
any
need
of
that
special
and
supreme
quality
called
genius
that
people
are
so
apt
to
ascribe
to
napoleon
yet
the
historians
who
described
the
event
later
and
the
men
who
then
sur
rounded
napoleon
and
he
himself
thought
otherwise
.
napoleon
rode
over
the
plain
and
surveyed
the
locality
with
a
profound
air
and
in
silence
nodded
with
approval
or
shook
his
head
du
biously
and
without
communicating
to
the
generals
around
him
the
profound
course
of
ideas
which
guided
his
decisions
merely
gave
them
his
final
conclusions
in
the
form
of
com
mands
.
having
listened
to
a
suggestion
from
davoutwho
was
now
called
prince
deckmiihl
to
turn
the
russian
left
wing
napoleon
said
it
should
not
be
done
without
explaining
why
not
.
to
a
proposal
made
by
general
campan
who
was
to
attack
the
fleches
to
lead
his
divi
sion
through
the
woods
napoleon
agreed
though
the
socalled
duke
of
elchingen
ney
ventured
to
remark
that
a
movement
through
the
woods
was
dangerous
and
might
disorder
the
division
.
having
inspected
the
country
opposite
the
shevardino
redoubt
napoleon
pondered
a
little
in
silence
and
then
indicated
the
spots
where
two
batteries
should
be
set
up
by
the
morrow
to
act
against
the
russian
entrench
ments
and
the
places
where
in
line
with
them
the
field
artillery
should
be
placed
.
after
giving
these
and
other
commands
he
returned
to
his
tent
and
the
dispositions
for
the
battle
were
written
down
from
his
dicta
tion
.
these
dispositions
of
which
the
french
his
torians
write
with
enthusiasm
and
other
his
torians
with
profound
respect
were

leons
instructions

the
second
order
was
that
poniatowski
moving
to
the
village
through
the
wood
should
turn
the
russian
left
flank
.
this
could
not

not

because

on

through

wood
met

driven
back
for
on
emerging
from
the
wood
it
had
to
re
form
under
grapeshot
of
which
napoleon
was
unaware
.
the
fourth
order
was
the
viceking
will
occupy
the
village
borodin6
and
cross
by
its
three
bridges
advancing
to
the

as

as

from
this
unintelligible
sentence
as
from
the
at
tempts
the
viceking
made
to

or
ders
given
him
he
was
to
advance
from
the
left
through
borodino
to
the
redoubt
while
the
divisions
of
morand
and
gerard
were
to
ad
vance
simultaneously
from
the
front
.
all
this
like
the
other
parts
of
the
disposi
tion
was
not
and
could
not
be
executed
.
aft
er
passing
through

the
viceking
was
driven
back
to
the
kolocha
and
could
get
no
farther
while
the
divisions
of

ge
rard
did
not
take
the
redoubt
but
were
driv
en

and
the
redoubt
was
only
taken
at
the
end
of
the
battle
by
the

a
thing
prob
ably
unforeseen

not

so
not
one
of
the
orders
in
the
disposition
was
or
could
be
executed
.

in
the
disposition
it
is
said
that
after
the
fight
has
commenced
in
this
manner
orders
will
be
given
in
accordance
with
the
enemys
movements
and
so
it
might
be
supposed
that
all
necessary
arrangements
would
be
made
by
napoleon
during
the
bat
tle
.
but
this
was
not
and
could
not
be
done
for
during
the
whole
battle
napoleon
was
so
far
away
that
as
appeared
later
he
could
not
know
the
course
of
the
battle
and
not
one
of
his
orders
during
the
fight
could
be

many
historians
say
that
the
french
did
not
win
the
battle
of
borodin6
because
napoleon
had
a
cold
and
that
if
he
had
not
had
a
cold
the
orders
he
gave
before
and
during
the
bat
tle
would
have
been
still
more
full
of
genius
and
russia
would
have
been
lost
and
the
face
of
the
world
have
been
changed
.
to
historians
who
believe
that
russia
was
shaped
by
the
will
of
one
manpeter
the
great
and
that
france
from
a
republic
became
an
empire
and
french
armies
went
to
russia
at
the
will
of
one
man
napoleon
to
say
that
russia
re
mained
a
power
because
napoleon
had
a
bad
cold
on
the
twentyfourth
of
august
may
seem
logical
and
convincing
.
if
it
had
depended
on
napoleons
will
to
fight
or
not
to
fight
the
battle
of
borodin6
and
if
this
or
that
other
arrangement
depended
on
his
will
then
evidently
a
cold
affecting
the
manifestation
of
his
will
might
have
saved
rus
sia
and
consequently
the
valet
who
omitted
to
bring
napoleon
his
waterproof
boots
on
the
twentyfourth
would
have
been
the
savior
of
russia
.
along
that
line
of
thought
such
a
de
duction
is
indubitable
as
indubitable
as
the
deduction
voltaire
made
in
jest
without
knowing
what
he
was
jesting
at
when
he
saw
that
the
massacre
of
st
.
bartholomew
was
due
to
charles
ixs
stomach
being
deranged
.
but
to
men
who
do
not
admit
that
russia
was
formed
by
the
will
of
one
man
peter
i
or
that
the
french
empire
was
formed
and
the
war
with
russia
begun
by
the
will
of
one
man
na
poleon
that
argument
seems
not
merely
un
true
and
irrational
but
contrary
to
all
human
reality
.
to
the
question
of
what
causes
historic
events
another
answer
presents
itself
namely
that
the
course
of
human
events
is
predeter
mined
from
on
high
depends
on
the
coinci
dence
of
the
wills
of
all
who
take
part
in
the
events
and
that
a
napoleons
influence
on
the
course
of
these
events
is
purely
external
and
fictitious
.
strange
as
at
first
glance
it
may
seem
to
sup
pose
that
the
massacre
of
st
.
bartholomew
was
not
due
to
charles
ixs
will
though
he
gave
the
order
for
it
and
thought
it
was
done
as
a
result
of
that
order
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
suppose
that
the
slaughter
of
eighty
thou
sand
men
at
borodin6
was
not
due
to
napo
leons
will
though
he
ordered
the
commence
ment
and
conduct
of
the
battle
and
thought
it
was
done
because
he
ordered
it
strange
as
these
suppositions
appear
yet
human
dignity
which
tells
me
that
each
of
us
is
if
not
more
448
war
and
peace
at
least
not
less
a
man
than
the
great
napole
ondemands
the
acceptance
of
that
solution
of
the
question
and
historic
investigation
abun
dantly
confirms
it
.
at
the
battle
of
borodin6
napoleon
shot
at
no
one
and
killed
no
one
.
that
was
all
done
by
the
soldiers
.
therefore
it
was
not
he
who
killed
people
.
the
french
soldiers
went
to
kill
and
be
killed
at
the
battle
of
borodin6
not
because
of
napoleons
orders
but
by
their
own
volition
.
the
whole
army
french
italian
german
polish
and
dutch
hungry
ragged
and
weary
of
the
campaign
felt
at
the
sight
of
an
army
blocking
their
road
to
moscow
that
the
wine
was
drawn
and
must
be
drunk
.
had
napoleon
then
forbidden
them
to
fight
the
russians
they
would
have
killed
him
and
have
proceeded
to
fight
the
russians
because
it
was
inevitable
.
when
they
heard
napoleons
proclamation
offering
them
as
compensation
for
mutilation
and
death
the
words
of
posterity
about
their
having
been
in
the
battle
before
moscow
they
cried
vive
iempereur
just
as
they
had
cried
vive
iempereur
at
the
sight
of
the
portrait
of
the
boy
piercing
the
terrestrial
globe
with
a
toy
stick
and
just
as
they
would
have
cried
vive
iempereur

at
any
nonsense
that
might
be
told
them
.
there
was
nothing
left
for
them
to
do
but
cry
vive
iempereur
and
go
to
fight
in
order
to
get
food
and
rest
as
conquer
ors
in
moscow
.
so
it
was
not
because
of
napo
leons
commands
that
they
killed
their
fellow
men
.
and
it
was
not
napoleon
who
directed
the
course
of
the
battle
for
none
of
his
orders
were
executed
and
during
the
battle
he
did
not
know
what
was
going
on
before
him
.
so
the
way
in
which
these
people
killed
one
another
was
not
decided
by
napoleons
will
but
oc
curred
independently
of
him
in
accord
with
the
will
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
who
took
part
in
the
common
action
.
it
only
seemed
to
napoleon
that
it
all
took
place
by
his
will
.
and
so
the
question
whether
he
had
or
had
not
a
cold
has
no
more
historic
interest
than
the
cold
of
the
least
of
the
transport
sol
diers
.
moreover
the
assertion
made
by
various
writ
ers
that
his
cold
was
the
cause
of
his
disposi
tions
not
being
as
well
planned
as
on
former
occasions
and
of
his
orders
during
the
battle
not
being
as
good
as
previously
is
quite
base
less
which
again
shows
that
napoleons
cold
on
the
twentysixth
of
august
was
unimpor
tant
.
the
dispositions
cited
above
are
not
at
all
worse
but
are
even
better
than
previous
dis
positions
by
which
he
had
won
victories
.
his
pseudoorders
during
the
battle
were
also
no
worse
than
formerly
but
much
the
same
as
us
ual
.
these
dispositions
and
orders
only
seem
worse
than
previous
ones
because
the
battle
of
borodin6
was
the
first
napoleon
did
not
win
.
the
profounclest
and
most
excellent
disposi
tions
and
orders
seem
very
bad
and
every
learned
militarist
criticizes
them
with
looks
of
importance
when
they
relate
to
a
battle
that
has
been
lost
and
the
very
worst
dispositions
and
orders
seem
very
good
and
serious
people
fill
whole
volumes
to
demonstrate
their
merits
when
they
relate
to
a
battle
that
has
been
won
.
the
dispositions
drawn
up
by
weyrother
for
the
battle
of
austerlitz
were
a
model
of
per
fection
for
that
kind
of
composition
but
still
they
were
criticized
criticized
for
their
very
perfection
for
their
excessive
minuteness
.
napoleon
at
the
battle
of
borodin6
fulfilled
his
office
as
representative
of
authority
as
well
as
and
even
better
than
at
other
battles
.
he
did
nothing
harmful
to
the
progress
of
the
bat
tle
he
inclined
to
the
most
reasonable
opin
ions
he
made
no
confusion
did
not
contradict
himself
did
not
get
frightened
or
run
away
from
the
field
of
battle
but
with
his
great
tact
and
military
experience
carried
out
his
role
of
appearing
to
command
calmly
and
with
dig
nity
.

having

napoleon
went
to

before
the
serious
busi
ness
which
he
considered
awaited
him
next
day

he
was
so
much
interested
in
that
task
that
he
was
unable
to
sleep
and
in
spite
of
his
cold
which
had
grown
worse
from
the
dampness
of
the
evening
he
went
into
the
large
division
of
the
tent
at
three
oclock
in

morning
loudly
blowing
his
nose
.
he
asked
whether
the
rus

had
not
withdrawn
and
was
told
that
the
enemys
fires
were
still
in

nodded
approval

we
shall

do
you
remember
at
braunau
he
commanded
an
army
for
three
weeks
and
did
not
once
mount
a
horse
to
inspect
his
entrenchments
.

.

.
we
shall
see
he
looked
at
his
watch
.
it
was
still
only
four
oclock
.
he
did
not
feel
sleepy
.
the
punch
was
finished
and
there
was
still
nothing
to
do
.
he
rose
walked
to
and
fro
put
on
a
warm
over
coat
and
a
hat
and
went
out
of
the
tent
.
the
night
was
dark
and
damp
a
scarcely
percepti
ble
moisture
was
descending
from
above
.
near
by
the
campfires
were
dimly
burning
among
the
french
guards
and
in
the
distance
those
of
the
russian
line
shone
through
the
smoke
.
the
weather
was
calm
and
the
rustle
and
tramp
of
the
french
troops
already
beginning
to
move
to
take
up
their
positions
were
clearly
audible
.
napoleon
walked
about
in
front
of
his
tent
looked
at
the
fires
and
listened
to
these
sounds
and
as
he
was
passing
a
tall
guardsman
in
a
shaggy
cap
who
was
standing
sentinel
before
his
tent
and
had
drawn
himself
up
like
a
black
pillar
at
sight
of
the
emperor
napoleon
stopped
in
front
of
him
.
what
year
did
you
enter
the
service
he
asked
with
that
affectation
of
military
blunt
ness
and
geniality
with
which
he
always
ad
dressed
the
soldiers
.
the
man
answered
the
question
.
ah
one
of
the
old
onesl
has
your
regi
ment
had
its
rice
it
has
your
majesty
.
napoleon
nodded
and
walked
away
.
at
halfpast
five
napoleon
rode
to
the
vil

of
shevardino
.
it
was
growing
light
the
sky
was
clearing
on
ly
a

cloud
lay
in
the
east
.
the
aban
doned
campfires
were
burning
themselves
out

in
the
faint
morning
light
.
on
the
right
a
single
deep
report
of
a

non
resounded
and
died
away
in
the
prevail
ing
silence
.
some
minutes
passed
.
a
second
and
a
third
report
shook
the
air
then
a
fourth
and
a
fifth
boomed
solemnly
near
by
on
the
right
.
the
first
shots
had
not
yet
ceased
to
rever
berate
before
others
rang
out
and
yet
more
were
heard
mingling
with
and
overtaking
one
another
.
napoleon
with
his
suite
rode
up
to

he
dismounted

the

to

in

before
he
was
thoroughly
awake
next

ing
everybody
had
already
left
the

the
panes
were
rattling
in
the
little
windows
and
his

was
shaking
him
.

he
kept
repeating
pertinaciously
while
he
shook
pierre
by
the
shoulder
without
looking
at
him
having
apparently
lost
hope
of
getting
him
to
wake
up
.
what
has
it
begun
is
it
time
pierre
asked
waking
up
.

the
groom
a

charged
soldier
.
all
the
gentlemen
have
gone
out
and
his
serene
highness
himself
rode
past
long
ago
.
pierre
dressed
hastily
and
ran
out
to
the
porch
.
outside
all
was
bright
fresh
dewy
and
cheerful
.
the
sun
just
bursting
forth
from
be
hind
a
cloud
that
had
concealed
it
was
shining
with
rays
still
half
broken
by
the
clouds
over
the

opposite
on

of

on

and
on

standing
before
the
hut
.
the
roar
of
guns
sounded
more
distinct
outside
.
an
adjutant
accompanied
by
a
cossack
passed
by
at
a
sharp
trot

went
down
the
street
to
the
knoll
from
which
he
had
looked
at
the
field
of
battle
the
day
before
.
a
crowd
of
military

was
assembled
there

of

could
be

gray
head
in
a
white
cap
with
a
red
band
was
visible
his
gray
nape
sunk
between
his
shoul

.
he
was
looking
through
a
field
glass
down
the
highroad
before
him
.
mounting
the
steps
to
the
knoll
pierre
looked
at
the
scene
before
him
spellbound
by
its
beau
ty
.
it
was
the
same
panorama
he
had
admired
from
that
spot
the
day
before
but
now
the
whole
place
was
full
of
troops
and
covered
by
smoke
clouds
from
the
guns
and
the
slanting
rays
of
the
bright
sun
rising
slightly
to
the
left
behind
pierre
cast
upon
it
through
the
clear
morning
air
penetrating
streaks
of
rosy
golden
tinted
light
and
long
dark
shadows
.
the
forest
at
the
farthest
extremity
of
the
panorama
seemed
carved
in
some
precious
stone
of
a
yel
lowishgreen
color
its
undulating
outline
was
silhouetted
against
the
horizon
and
was
pierced
beyond
valuevo
by
the
smolensk
highroad
crowded
with
troops
.
nearer
at
hand
glittered
golden
cornfields
interspersed
with
copses
.
there
were
troops
to
be
seen
everywhere
in
front
and
to
the
right
and
left
.
all
this
was
vivid
majestic
and
unexpected
but
what
im
pressed
pierre
most
of
all
was
the
view
of
the
battlefield
itself
of
borodin6
and
the
hollows
on
both
sides
of
the
kolocha
above
the
kolocha
in
borodin6
and
on
both
sides
of
it
especially
to
the
left
where
the
v6yna
flowing
between
its
marshy
banks
falls
into
the
kolochd
a
mist
had
spread
which
seemed
to
melt
to
dissolve
and
to
become
translucent
when
the
brilliant
sun
appeared
and
magically
colored
and
outlined
every
thing
.
the
smoke
of
the
guns
mingled
with
this
mist
and
over
the
whole
expanse
and
through
that
mist
the
rays
of
the
morning
sun
were
reflect
ed
flashing
back
like
lightning
from
the
water
from
the
dew
and
from
the
bayonets
of
the
troops
crowded
together
by
the
riverbanks
and
in
borodin6
.
a
white
church
could
be
seen
through
the
mist
and
here
and
there
the
roofs
of
huts
in
borodin6
as
well
as
dense
masses
of
soldiers
or
green
ammunition
chests
and
ordnance
.
and
all
this
moved
or
seemed
to
move
as
the
smoke
and
mist
spread
out
over
the
whole
space
.
just
as
in
the
mistenveloped
hollow
near
borodin6
so
along
the
entire
line
outside
and
above
it

especially
in

woods
and
fields
to
the
left
in
the
valleys
and
on
the
summits
of
the

clouds
of

seemed
continually
to

these
puffs
of
smoke
and
strange
to
say
the
sound
of
the
firing
produced
the
chief
beau
ty
of
the
spectacle
.
puff
suddenly
a
round
compact
cloud
of
smoke
was
seen
merging
from
violet
into
gray
and
milky
white
and
boom
came
the
re

a

later
.
puff

and
two
clouds
arose
pushing
one
another
and
blending
together
and
boom
boom
came
the
sounds
confirming
what
the
eye
had
seen
.
pierre
glanced
round
at
the
first
cloud
which
he
had
seen
as
a
round
compact
ball
and
in
its
place
already
were
balloons
of
smoke
floating
to
one
side
and
puff
with
a
pause
puff
puff
three
and
then
four
more
appeared
and
then
from
each
with
the
same
interval
boom
boom
boom
came
the
fine
firm
precise
sounds
in
reply
.
it
seemed
as
if
those
smoke
clouds
sometimes
ran
and
sometimes
stood
still
while
woods
fields
and
glittering
bayonets
ran
past
them
.
from
the
left
over
fields
and
bushes
those
large
balls
of
smoke
were
continually
appearing
followed
by
their
solemn
reports
while
nearer
still
in
the
hol
lows
and
woods
there
burst
from
the
muskets
small
cloudlets
that
had
no
time
to
become
balls
but
had
their
little
echoes
in
just
the
same
way
.
trakhtatatakh
came
the
fre
quent
crackle
of
musketry
but
it
was
irregular
and
feeble
in
comparison
with
the
reports
of
the
cannon
.
pierre
wished
to
be
there
with
that
smoke
those
shining
bayonets
that
movement
and
those
sounds
.
he
turned
to
look
at
kutuzov
and
his
suite
to
compare
his
impressions
with
those
of
others
.
they
were
all
looking
at
the
field
of
battle
as
he
was
and
as
it
seemed
to
him
with
the
same
feelings
.
all
their
faces
were
now
shining
with
that
latent
warmth
of
feeling
pierre
had
noticed
the
day
before
and
had
fully
understood
after
his
talk
with
prince
andrew
.
go
my
dear
fellow

and
christ
be
with
you
i
kutuzov
was
saying
to
a
general
who
stood
beside
him
not
taking
his
eye
from
the
battlefield
.
having
received
this
order
the
general
passed
by
pierre
on
his
way
down
the
knoll
.
to
the
crossing
said
the
general
coldly
and
sternly
in
reply
to
one
of
the
staff
who
asked
where
he
was
going
.
til
go
there
too
i
tool
thought
pierre
and
followed
the
general
.
the
general
mounted
a
horse
a
cossack
had
brought
him
.
pierre
went
to
his
groom
who
was
holding
his
horses
and
asking
which
was
the
quietest
clambered
onto
it
seized
it
by
the
mane
and
turning
out
his
toes
pressed
his
heels
against
its
sides
and
feeling
that
his
spectacles
were
slipping
off
but
unable
to
let
go
of
the
mane
and
reins
he
galloped
after
the
general
causing
the
staff
officers
to
imile
as
they
watched
him
from
the
knoll
.
chapter
xxxi
having
descended
the
hill
the
general
after
whom
pierre
was
galloping
turned
sharply
to
the
left
and
pierre
losing
sight
of
him
gal
loped
in
among
some
ranks
of
infantry
march
ing
ahead
of
him
.
he
tried
to
pass
either
in
front
of
them
or
to
the
right
or
left
but
there
were
soldiers
everywhere
all
with
the
same
pre
occupied
expression
and
busy
with
some
un
seen
but
evidently
important
task
.
they
all
gazed
with
the
same
dissatisfied
and
inquir
ing
expression
at
this
stout
man
in
a
white
hat
who
for
some
unknown
reason
threatened
to
trample
them
under
his
horses
hoofs
.
why
ride
into
the
middle
of
the
battalion
one
of
them
shouted
at
him
.
another
prodded
his
horse
with
the
butt
end
of
a
musket
and
pierre
bending
over
his
saddlebow
and
hardly
able
to
control
his
shy
ing
horse
galloped
ahead
of
the
soldiers
where
there
was
a
free
space
.
there
was
a
bridge
ahead
of
him
where
oth
er
soldiers
stood
firing
.
pierre
rode
up
to
them
.
without
being
aware
of
it
he
had
come
to
the
bridge
across
the
kolochd
between
g6rki
and
borodin6
which
the
french
having
occupied
borodin6
were
attacking
in
the
first
phase
of
the
battle
.
pierre
saw
that
there
was
a
bridge
in
front
of
him
and
that
soldiers
were
doing
something
on
both
sides
of
it
and
in
the
mead
ow
among
the
rows
of
newmown
hay
which
he
had
taken
no
notice
of
amid
the
smoke
of
the
campfires
the
day
before
but
despite
the
incessant
firing
going
on
there
he
had
no
idea
that
this
was
the
field
of
battle
.
he
did
not
no
tice
the
sound
of
the
bullets
whistling
from
every
side
or
the
projectiles
that
flew
over
him
did
not
see
the
enemy
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
for
a
long
time
did
not
notice
the
killed
and
wounded
though
many
fell
near
him
.
he
looked
about
him
with
a
smile
which
did
not
leave
his
face
.
whys
that
fellow
in
front
of
the
line
shouted
somebody
at
him

the

shouted
to
him
.
pierre
went
to
the
right
and
unexpectedly

war
and
peace
encountered
one
of
ravskis
adjutants
whom
he
knew
.
the
adjutant
looked
angrily
at
him
evidently
also
intending
to
shout
at
him
but
on
recognizing
him
he
nodded
.
how
have
you
got
here
he
said
and
gal
loped
on
.
pierre
feeling
out
of
place
there
having
nothing
to
do
and
afraid
of
getting
in
some
ones
way
again
galloped
after
the
adjutant
.
whats
happening
here
may
i
come
with
you
he
asked
.
one
moment
one
moment
replied
the
adjutant
and
riding
up
to
a
stout
colonel
who
was
standing
in
the
meadow
he
gave
him
some
message
and
then
addressed
pierre
.
why
have
you
come
here
count
he
asked
with
a
smile
.
still
inquisitive
yes
yes
assented
pierre
.
but
the
adjutant
turned
his
horse
about
and
rode
on
.
here
its
tolerable
said
he
but
with
ba
grati6n
on
the
left
flank
theyre
getting
it
frightfully
hot
.
really
said
pierre
.
where
is
that
come
along
with
me
to
our
knoll
.
we
can
get
a
view
from
there
and
in
our
battery
it
is
still
bearable
said
the
adjutant
.
will
you
come
yes
ill
come
with
you
replied
pierre
looking
round
for
his
groom
.
it
was
only
now
that
he
noticed
wounded
men
staggering
along
or
being
carried
on
stretchers
.
on
that
very
meadow
he
had
rid
den
over
the
day
before
a
soldier
was
lying
athwart
the
rows
of
scented
hay
with
his
head
thrown
awkwardly
back
and
his
shako
off
.
why
havent
they
carried
him
away
pierre
was
about
to
ask
but
seeing
the
stern
expres
sion
of
the
adjutant
who
was
also
looking
that
way
he
checked
himself
.
pierre
did
not
find
his
groom
and
rode
along
the
hollow
with
the
adjutant
to
racv
skis
redoubt
.
his
horse
lagged
behind
the
ad
jutants
and
jolted
him
at
every
step
.
you
dont
seem
to
be
used
to
riding
count
remarked
the
adjutant
.
no
its
not
that
but
her
action
seems
so
jerky
said
pierre
in
a
puzzled
tone
.

i
congratulate
you

on
your
baptism
of

having
ridden
in
the

past
the

corps
behind
the
artillery
which
had
been
moved
forward
and
was
in
action
deafening
them
with
the
noise
of
firing
they
came
to
a
small
wood
.
there
it
was
cool
and
quiet
with
a
scent
of
autumn
.
pierre
and
the
adjutant
dis
mounted
and
walked
up
the
hill
on
foot
.
is
the
general
here
asked
the
adjutant
on
reaching
the
knoll
.
he
was
here
a
minute
ago
but
has
just
gone
that
way
someone
told
him
pointing
to
the
right
.
the
adjutant
looked
at
pierre
as
if
puzzled
what
to
do
with
him
now
.
dont
trouble
about
me
said
pierre
.
ill
go
up
onto
the
knoll
if
i
may
yes
do
.
youll
see
everything
from
there
and
its
less
dangerous
and
ill
come
for
you
.
pierre
went
to
the
battery
and
the
adjutant
rode
on
.
they
did
not
meet
again
and
only
much
later
did
pierre
learn
that
he
lost
an
arm
that
day
.
the
knoll
to
which
pierre
ascended
was
that
famous
one
afterwards
known
to
the
russians
as
the
knoll
battery
or
rachskis
redoubt
and
to
the
french
as

grande

around
which
tens
of
thousands
fell
and
which
the
french
regarded
as
the
key
to
the
whole
po
sition
.
this
redoubt
consisted
of
a
knoll
on
three
sides
of
which
trenches
had
been
dug
.
within
the
entrenchment
stood
ten
guns
that
were
being
fired
through
openings
in
the
earth
work
.
in
line
with
the
knoll
on
both
sides
stood
other
guns
which
also
fired
incessantly
.
a
little
behind
the
guns
stood
infantry
.
when
ascend
ing
that
knoll
pierre
had
no
notion
that
this
spot
on
which
small
trenches
had
been
dug
and
from
which
a
few
guns
were
firing
was
the
most
important
point
of
the
battle
.
on
the
contrary
just
because
he
happened
to
be
there
he
thought
it
one
of
the
least
sig
nificant
parts
of
the
field
.
having
reached
the
knoll
pierre
sat
down
at
one
end
of
a
trench
surrounding
the
battery
and
gazed
at
what
was
going
on
around
him
with
an
unconsciously
happy
smile
.
occasion
ally
he
rose
and
walked
about
the
battery
still
with
that
same
smile
trying
not
to
obstruct
the
soldiers
who
were
loading
hauling
the
guns
and
continually
running
past
him
with
bags
and
charges
.
the
guns
of
that
battery
were
being
fired
continually
one
after
another
with
a
deafening
roar
enveloping
the
whole
neigh
borhood
in
powder
smoke
.
in
contrast
with
the
dread
felt
by
the
in
fantrymen
placed
in
support
here
in
the
bat
tery
where
a
small
number
of
men
busy
at
their
book
work
were
separated
from
the
rest
by
a
trench
everyone
experienced
a
common
and
as
it
were
family
feeling
of
animation
.
the
intrusion
of
pierres
nonmilitary
figure
in
a
white
hat
made
an
unpleasant
impression
at
first
.
the
soldiers
looked
askance
at
him
with
surprise
and
even
alarm
as
they
went
past
him
.
the
senior
artillery
officer
a
tall
longlegged
pockmarked
man
moved
over
to
pierre
as
if
to
see
the
action
of
the
farthest
gun
and
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
.
a
young
roundfaced
officer
quite
a
boy
still
and
evidently
only
just
out
of
the
cadet
col
lege
who
was
zealously
commanding
the
two
guns
entrusted
to
him
addressed
pierre
sternly
.
sir
he
said
permit
me
to
ask
you
to
stand
aside
.
you
must
not
be
here
.
the
soldiers
shook
their
heads
disapprov
ingly
as
they
looked
at
pierre
.
but
when
they
had
convinced
themselves
that
this
man
in
the
white
hat
was
doing
no
harm
but
either
sat
quietly
on
the
slope
of
the
trench
with
a
shy
smile
or
politely
making
way
for
the
soldiers
paced
up
and
down
the
battery
under
fire
as
calmly
as
if
he
were
on
a
boulevard
their
feel
ing
of
hostile
distrust
gradually
began
to
change
into
a
kindly
and
bantering
sympathy
such
as
soldiers
feel
for
their
dogs
cocks
goats
and
in
general
for
the
animals
that
live
with
the
regiment
.
the
men
soon
accepted
pierre
into
their
family
adopted
him
gave
him
a
nickname
our
gentleman
and
made
kind
ly
fun
of
him
among
themselves
.
a
shell
tore
up
the
earth
two
paces
from
pi
erre
and
he
looked
around
with
a
smile
as
he
brushed
from
his
clothes
some
earth
it
had
thrown
up
.
and
hows
it
youre
not
afraid
sir
really
now
a
redfaced
broadshouldered
soldier
asked
pierre
with
a
grin
that
disclosed
a
set
of
sound
white
teeth
.
are
you
afraid
then
said
pierre
.
what
else
do
you
expect
answered
the
soldier
.

cant
help
being

he
said
laughing
.
several
of
the
men
with
bright
kindly
faces
stopped
beside
pierre
.
they
seemed
not
to
have
expected
him
to
talk
like
anybody
else
and
the
discovery
that
he
did
so
delighted
them
.
its
the
business
of

but
in

its
wonderful
theres

cried
the
young
officer
to
the

gathered
round

the
young
officer
was
evidently
exercising
his
duties
for
the
first
or
second
time
and
therefore
treated
both
his
superiors
and
the
men
with
great
precision
and
formality
.
the
booming
cannonade
and
the
fusillade
of
musketry
were
growing
more
intense
over
the
whole
field
especially
to
the
left
where
ba
grati6ns
fleches
were
but
where
pierre
was
the
smoke
of
the
firing
made
it
almost
im
possible
to
distinguish
anything
.
moreover
his
whole
attention
was
engrossed
by
watch
ing
the
family
circle
separated
from
all
else
formed
by
the
men
in
the
battery
.
his
first
unconscious
feeling
of
joyful
animation
pro
duced
by
the
sights
and
sounds
of
the
battle
field
was
now
replaced
by
another
especially
since
he
had
seen
that
soldier
lying
alone
in
the
hayfield
.
now
seated
on
the
slope
of
the
trench
he
observed
the
faces
of
those
around
him
.
by
ten
oclock
some
twenty
men
had
already
been
carried
away
from
the
battery
two
guns
were
smashed
and
cannon
balls
fell
more
and
more
frequently
on
the
battery
and
spent
bullets
buzzed
and
whistled
around
.
but
the
men
in
the
battery
seemed
not
to
notice
this
and
merry
voices
and
jokes
were
heard
on
all
sides
.
a
live

shouted
a
man
as
a
whistling
shell
approached
.
not

to
the

added
an
other
with
loud
laughter
seeing
the
shell
fly
past
and
fall
into
the
ranks
of
the
supports
.
are
you
bowing
to
a
friend
eh
remarked
another
chaffing
a
peasant
who
ducked
low
as
a
cannon
ball
flew
over
.
several
soldiers
gathered
by
the
wall
of
the
trench
looking
out
to
see
what
was

ing
in

an

shouted
at

.
if
theyve
retired
its
because
theres
work
for
them
to
do

back
.
and
the
sergeant
taking
one
of
the
men
by
the
shoulders
gave
him
a
shove
with
his
knee
.
this
was
followed
by
a
burst
of
laughter
.
to
the
fifth
gun
wheel
it
up
came
shouts
from
one
side
.
now
then
all
together
like
bargees
rose
the
merry
voices
of

who
were

pierre
noticed
that
after
every
ball
that
hit
the
redoubt
and
after
every
loss
the
liveliness
increased
more
and
more
.
as
the
flames
of
the
fire
hidden
within
come
more
and
more
vividly
and
rapidly
from
an
approaching
thundercloud
so
as
if
in
opposi
tion
to
what
was
taking
place
the
lightning
of
hidden
fire
growing
more
and
more
intense
glowed
in
the
faces
of
these
men
.
pierre
did
not
look
out
at
the
battlefield
and
was
not
concerned
to
know
what
was
happen
ing
there
he
was
entirely
absorbed
in
watch
ing
this
fire
which
burned
ever
more
brightly
and
which
he
felt
was
flaming
up
in
the
same
way
in
his
own
soul
.
at
ten
oclock
the
infantry
that
had
been
among
the
bushes
in
front
of
the
battery
and
along
the
kdmenka
streamlet
retreated
.
from
the
battery
they
could
be
seen
running
back
past
it
carrying
their
wounded
on
their
mus
kets
.
a
general
with
his
suite
came
to
the
bat
tery
and
after
speaking
to
the
colonel
gave
pierre
an
angry
look
and
went
away
again
having
ordered
the
infantry
supports
behind
the
battery
to
lie
down
so
as
to
be
less
ex
posed
to
fire
.
after
this
from
amid
the
ranks
of
infantry
to
the
right
of
the
battery
came
the
sound
of
a
drum
and
shouts
of
command
and
from
the
battery
one
saw
how
those
ranks
of
infantry
moved
forward
.
pierre
looked
over
the
wall
of
the
trench
and
was
particularly
struck
by
a
pale
young
officer
who
letting
his
sword
hang
down
was
walking
backwards
and
kept
glancing
uneasily
around
.
the
ranks
of
the
infantry
disappeared
amid
the
smoke
but
their
longdrawn
shout
and
rap
id
musketry
firing
could
still
be
heard
.
a
few
minutes
later
crowds
of
wounded
men
and
stretcherbearers
came
back
from
that
direction
.
projectiles
began
to
fall
still
more
frequently
in
the
battery
.
several
men
were
lying
about
who
had
not
been
removed
.
around
the
cannon
the
men
moved
still
more
briskly
and
busily
.
no
one
any
longer
took
notice
of
pierre
.
once
or
twice
he
was
shouted
at
for
being
in
the
way
.
the
senior
officer
moved
with
big
rapid
strides
from
one
gun
to
another
with
a
frowning
face
.
the
young
officer
with
his
face
still
more
flushed
commanded
the
men
more
scrupulous
ly
than
ever

the
soldiers
handed
up
the
charges
turned
loaded
and
did
their
business
with
strained
smartness
.
they
gave
little
jumps
as
they
walked
as
though
they
were
on
springs
.
the
storrncloud
had
come
upon
them
and
in
every
face
the
fire
which
pierre
had
watched
kindle
burned
up
brightly
.

the

gave
a
gasp
and
benclingdouble
sat
down
on
the

on

became

beside

pierre
jumped
up
and
ran
back
to
the
battery
as
to
the
only
ref
uge
from
the
horrors
that
surrounded
him
.
on
entering
the
earthwork
he
noticed
that
there
were
men
doing
something
there
but
that
no
shots
were
being
fired
from
the
battery
.
he
had
no
time
to
realize
who
these
men
were
.
he
saw
the
senior
officer
lying
on
the
earth
wall
with
his
back
turned
as
if
he
were
examining
something
down
below
and
that
one
of
the
sol
diers
he
had
noticed
before
was
struggling
for
ward
shouting
brothers
and
trying
to
free
himself
from
some
men
who
were
holding
him
by
the
arm
.
he
also
saw
something
else
that
was
strange
.
but
he
had
not
time
to
realize
that
the
colo
nel
had
been
killed
that
the
soldier
shouting
brothers
was
a
prisoner
and
that
another
man
had
been
bayoneted
in

back
before
his
eyes
for
hardly
had
he
run
into
the
re

before
a
thin
sallowfaced

man
in
a

rushed
on
him

seized

a

by

with

and
by
the
throat
with
the
other
.
the
officer
dropping
his
sword
seized
pierre
by
his
collar
.
for
some
seconds
they
gazed
with
frightened
eyes
at
one
anothers
unfamiliar

and
both
were
perplexed
at
what
they
had

what
they

was

the

inclined
to
think
he
had
been
taken

because
pierres
strong
hand
impelled
by
instinctive
fear
squeezed
his
throat
ever
tight

and
tighter

the
frenchman
was
about
to
say
something
when
just
above
their
heads
terrible
and
low
a
cannon
ball
whistled
and
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
the
french
officers
head
had
been
torn
off
so
swiftly
had
he
ducked
it
.
pierre
too
bent
his
head
and
let
his
hands
fall
.
without
further
thought
as
to
who
had
taken

prisoner
the
frenchman
ran
back
to
the
battery
and
pierre
ran
down
the
slope
stumbling
over
the
dead
and
wounded
who
it
seemed
to
him
caught
at
his
feet
.
but
before
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
knoll
he
was
met
by
a
dense
crowd
of
russian

who

tripping
up

of

that

there
was
on
the

side
a

made
by

russians
with

cavalry
at
midday
and
on
the
other
side
beyond

with

but
these
two
were
detached
and
feeble
actions
in
comparison
with
what
took
place
in
the
center
of
the
battlefield
.
on
the
field
between
borodin6
and
the
fleches
be
side
the
wood
the
chief
action
of
the
day
took
place
on
an
open
space
visible
from
both
sides
and
was
fought
in
the
simplest
and
most
art
less
way
.
the
battle
began
on
both
sides
with
a
can
nonade
from
several
hundred
guns
.
then
when
the
whole
field
was
covered
with
smoke
two
divisions
campans
and
dessaixs
advanced
from
the
french
right
while
murats
troops
advanced
on
borodino
from
their
left
.
from
the
shevdrdino
redoubt
where
napo
leon
was
standing
the
fleches
were
two
thirds
of
a
mile
away
and
it
was
more
than
a
mile
as
the
crow
flies
to
borodin6
so
that
napoleon
could
not
see
what
was
happening
there
es
pecially
as
the
smoke
mingling
with
the
mist
hid
the
whole
locality
.
the
soldiers
of
dessaixs
division
advancing
against
the
fleches
could
only
be
seen
till
they
had
entered
the
hollow
that
lay
between
them
and
the
fleches
.
as
soon
as
they
had
descended
into
that
hollow
the
smoke
of
the
guns
and
musketry
on
the
fleches
grew
so
dense
that
it
covered
the
whole
ap
proach
on
that
side
of
it
.
through
the
smoke
glimpses
could
be
caught
of
something
black
probably
menand
at
times
the
glint
of
bayonets
.
but
whether
they
were
moving
or
stationary
whether
they
were
french
or
rus
sian
could
not
be
discovered
from
the
shevar
dino
redoubt
.
the
sun
had
risen
brightly
and
its
slanting
rays
struck
straight
into
napoleons
face
as
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
he
looked
at
the
fleches
.the
smoke
spread
out
before
them
and
at
times
it
looked
as
if
the
smoke
were
moving
at
times
as
if
the
troops
moved
.
some
times
shouts
were
heard
through
the
firing
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
was
being
done
there
.
napoleon
standing
on
the
.
knoll
looked
through
a
field
glass
and
in
its
small
circlet
saw
smoke
and
men
sometimes
his
own
and
sometimes
russians
but
when
he
looked
again
with
the
naked
eye
he
could
not
tell
where
what
he
had
seen
was
.
he
descended
the
knoll
and
began
walking
up
and
down
before
it
.
occasionally
he
stopped
listened
to
the
fir
ing
and
gazed
intently
at
the
battlefield
.
but
not
only
was
it
impossible
to
make
out
what
was
happening
from
where
he
was
stand
ing
down
below
or
from
the
knoll
above
on
which
some
of
his
generals
had
taken
their
stand
but
even
from
the
fleches
themselves
in
which
by
this
time
there
were
now
russian
and
now
french
soldiers
alternately
or
to
gether
dead
wounded
alive
frightened
or
maddened
even
at
those
fleches
themselves
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
what
was
taking
place
.
there
for
several
hours
amid
incessant
cannon
and
musketry
fire
now
russians
were
seen
alone
now
frenchmen
alone
now
in
fantry
and
now

not
knowing
what

screamed
and
ran
back
again
.
from
the
battlefield
adjutants
he
had
sent
out
and
orderlies
from
his
marshals
kept
galloping
up
to
napoleon
with
reports
of
the
progress
of
the
action
but
all
these
reports
were
false
both
because
it
was
impossible
in
the
heat
of
battle
to
say
what
was
happening
at
any
given
moment
and
because
many
of
the
adjutants
did
not
go
to
the
actual
place
of
conflict
but
reported
what
they
had
heard
from
others
and
also
because
while
an
adjutant
was
riding
more
than
a
mile
to
napoleon
circum
stances
changed
and
the
news
he
brought
was
already
becoming
false
.
thus
an
adjutant
gal
loped
up
from
murat
with
tidings
that
boro
din6
had
been
occupied
and
the
bridge
over
the
kolochd
was
in
the
hands
of
the
french
.
the
adjutant
asked
whether
napoleon
wished
the
troops
to
cross
it
napoleon
gave
orders
that
the
troops
should
form
up
on
the
farther
side
and
wait
.
but
before
that
order
was
given
almost
as
soon
in
fact
as
the
adjutant
had
book
ten
457
left
borodin6
the
bridge
had
been
retaken
by
the
russians
and
burned
in
the
very
skirmish
at
which
pierre
had
been
present
at
the
begin
ning
of
the
battle
.
an
adjutant
galloped
up
from
the
fleches
with
a
pale
and
frightened
face
and
reported
to
napoleon
that
their
attack
had
been
re
pulsed
campan
wounded
and
davout
killed
yet
at
the
very
time
the
adjutant
had
been
told
that
the
french
had
been
repulsed
the
fitches
had
in
fact
been
recaptured
by
other
french
troops
and
davout
was
alive
and
only
slightly
bruised
.
on
the
basis
of
these
necessarily
un
trustworthy
reports
napoleon
gave
his
orders
which
had
either
been
executed
before
he
gave
them
or
could
not
be
and
were
not
exe
cuted
.
the
marshals
and
generals
who
were
nearer
to
the
field
of
battle
but
like
napoleon
did
not
take
part
in
the
actual
fighting
and
only
occasionally
went
within
musket
range
made
their
own
arrangements
without
asking
napo
leon
and
issued
orders
where
and
in
what
di
rection
to
fire
and
where
cavalry
should
gallop
and
infantry
should
run
.
but
even
theirorders
like
napoleons
were
seldom
carried
out
and
then
but
partially
.
for
the
most
part
things
happened
contrary
to
their
orders
.
soldiers
ordered
to
advance
ran
back
on
meetinggrape
shot
soldiers
ordered
to
remain
where
they
were
suddenly
seeing
russians
unexpectedly
before
them
sometimes
rushed
back
and
some
times
forward
and
the
cavalry
dashed
without
orders
in
pursuit
of
the
flying
russians
.
in
this
way
two
cavalry
regiments
galloped
through
the
semenovsk
hollow
and
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
top
of
the
incline
turned
round
and
galloped
full
speed
back
again
.
the
in
fantry
moved
in
the
same
way
sometimes
run
ning
to
quite
other
places
than
those
they
were
ordered
to
go
to
.
all
orders
as
to
where
and
when
to
move
the
guns
when
to
send
in
fantry
to
shoot
or
horsemen
to
ride
down
the
russian
infantry
all
such
orders
were
given
by
the
officers
on
the
spot
nearest
to
the
units
concerned
without
asking
either
ney
davout
or
murat
much
less
napoleon
.
they
did
not
fear
getting
into
trouble
for
not
fulfilling
or
ders
or
for
acting
on
their
own
initiative
for
in
battle
what
is
at
stake
is
what
is
dearest
to
manhis
own
life
and
it
sometimes
seems
that
safety
lies
in
running
back
sometimes
in
run
ning
forward
and
these
men
who
were
right
in
the
heat
of
the
battle
acted
according
to
the
mood
of
the
moment
.
in
reality
however
all
these
movements
forward
and
backward
did
not
improve
or
alter
the
position
of
the
troops
.
all
their
rushing
and
galloping
at
one
another
did
little
harm
the
harm
of
disablement
and
death
was
caused
by
the
balls
and
bullets
that
flew
over
the
fields
on
which
these
men
were
floundering
about
.
as
soon
as
they
left

and
bullets
were

superiors

back

them
and
brought
them
under
discipline
and
under
the
influence
of
that
discipline
led
them
back
to
the
zone
of
fire
where
under
the
influence
of
fear
of
death
they
lost
their
discipline
and
rushed
about
ac
cording
to
the
chance
promptings
of
the
throng
.

the
handsome
boy
adjutant
with
the
long
hair
sighed
deeply
without
removing
his
hand
from
his
hat
and
galloped
back
to
where
men
were
being
slaughtered
.
napoleon
rose
and
having
summoned
caul
aincourt
and
berthier
began
talking
to
them
about
matters
unconnected
with
the
battle
.
in
the
midst
of
this
conversation
which
was
beginning
to
interest
napoleon
berthiers
eyes
turned
to
look
at
a
general
with
a
suite
who
was
galloping
toward
the
knoll
on
a
lathering
458
war
and
peace
horse
.
it
was
belliard
.
having
dismounted
he
went
up
to
the
emperor
with
rapid
strides
and
in
a
loud
voice
began
boldly
demonstrating
the
necessity
of
sending
reinforcements
.
he
swore
on
his
honor
that
the
russians
were
lost
if
the
emperor
would
give
another
division
.
napoleon
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
con
tinued
to
pace
up
and
down
without
replying
.
belliard
began
talking
loudly
and
eagerly
to
the
generals
of
the

around
him
.

before

galloped
up

napoleon
with

the

bent

affirmatively
and
began
to

but
the

turned
from
him

a
couple
of
steps

the

galloped
to

and
a

later
the
young

from
all
sides
adjutants
continued
to
arrive
at
a
gallop
and
as
if
by
agreement
all
said
the
same
thing
.
they
all
asked
for
reinforcements
and
all
said
that
the
russians
were
holding
their
positions
and
maintaining
a
hellish
fire
under
which
the
french
army
was
melting
away
.

after

flinging

about

already
been
employed
yet
not
only
was
there
no
victory
but
from
all
sides
came
the
same
news
of
generals
killed
and
wounded
of
rein
forcements
needed
of
the
impossibility
of
driv
ing
back
the
russians
and
of
disorganization
among
his
own
troops
.
formerly
after
he
had
given
two
or
three
orders
and
uttered
a
few
phrases
marshals
and
adjutants
had
come
galloping
up
with
con
gratulations
and
happy
faces
announcing
the
trophies
taken
the
corps
of
prisoners
bundles
book
ten
459
of
enemy
eagles
and
standards
cannon
and
stores
and
murat
had
only
begged
leave
to
loose
the
cavalry
to
gather
in
the
baggage
wagons
.
so
it
had
been
at
lodi
marengo
ar
cola
jena
austerlitz
wagram
and
so
on
.
but
now
something
strange
was
happening
to
his
troops
.
despite
news
of
the
capture
of
the
fitches
napoleon
saw
that
this
was
not
the
same
not
at
all
the
same
as
what
had
happened
in
his
former
battles
.
he
saw
that
what
he
was
feel
ing
was
felt
by
all
the
men
about
him
experi
enced
in
the
art
of
war
.
all
their
faces
looked
dejected
and
they
all
shunned
one
anothers
eyes
only
a
de
beausset
could
fail
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
what
was
happening
.
but
napoleon
with
hts
long
experience
of
war
well
knew
the
meaning
of
a
battle
not
gained
by
the
attacking
side
in
eight
hours
after
all
efforts
had
been
expended
.
he
knew
that
it
was
a
lost
battle
and
that
the
least
acci
dent
might
now
with
the
fight
balanced
on
such
a
strained
center
destroy
him
and
his
army
.
when
he
ran
his
mind
over
the
whole
of
this
strange
russian
campaign
in
which
not
one
battle
had
been
won
and
in
which
not
a
flag
or
cannon
or
army
corps
had
been
cap
tured
in
two
months
when
he
looked
at
the
concealed
depression
on
the
faces
around
him
and
heard
reports
of
the
russians
still
holding
their
ground
a
terrible
feeling
like
a
night
mare
took
possession
of
him
and
all
the
un
lucky
accidents
that
might
destroy
him
oc
curred
to
his
mind
.
the
russians
might
fall
on
his
left
wing
might
break
through
his
cen
ter
he
himself
might
be
killed
by
a
stray
can
non
ball
.
all
this
was
possible
.
in
former
battles
he
had
only
considered
the
possibilities
of
success
but
now
innumerable
unlucky
chances
presented
themselves
and
he
expected
them
all
.
yes
it
was
like
a
dream
in
which
a
man
fancies
that
a
ruffian
is
coming
to
attack
him
and
raises
his
arm
to
strike
that
ruffian
a
terrible
blow
which
he
knows
should
annihi
late
him
but
then
feels
that
his
arm
drops
powerless
and
limp
like
a
rag
and
the
horror
of
unavoidable
destruction
seizes
him
in
his
helplessness
.
the
news
that
the
russians
were
attacking
the
left
flank
of
the
french
army
aroused
that
horror
in
napoleon
.
he
sat
silently
on
a
camp
stool
below
the
knoll
with
head
bowed
and
elbows
on
his
knees
.
berthier
approached
and
suggested
that
they
should
ride
along
the
line
to
ascertain
the
position
of
affairs
.
what
what
do
you
say
asked
napoleon
.
yes
tell
them
to
bring
me
my
horse
.
he
mounted
and
rode
toward
semenovsk
.
amid
the
powder
smoke
slowly
dispersing
over
the
whole
space
through
which
napoleon
rode
horses
and
men
were
lying
in
pools
of
blood
singly
or
in
heaps
.
neither
napoleon
nor
any
of
his
generals
had
ever
before
seen
such
horrors
or
so
many
slain
in
such
a
small
area
.
the
roar
of
guns
that
had
not
ceased
for
ten
hours
wearied
the
ear
and
gave
a
peculiar
significance
to
the
spectacle
as
music
does
to
tableaux
vivants
.
napoleon
rode
up
the
high
ground
at
semenovsk
and
through
the
smoke
saw
ranks
of
men
in
uniforms
of
a
color
un
familiar
to
him
.
they
were
russians
.
the
russians
stood
in
serried
ranks
behind
semenovsk
village
and
its
knoll
and
their
guns
boomed
incessantly
along
their
line
and
sent
forth
clouds
of
smoke
.
it
was
no
longer
a
bat
tle
it
was
a
continuous
slaughter
which
could
be
of
no
avail
either
to
the
french
or
the
rus
sians
.
napoleon
stopped
his
horse
and
again
fell
into
the
reverie
from
which
berthier
had
aroused
him
.
he
could
not
stop
what
was
go
ing
on
before
him
and
around
him
and
was
supposed
to
be
directed
by
him
and
to
depend
on
him
and
from
its
lack
of
success
this
affair
for
the
first
time
seemed
to
him
unnecessary
and
horrible
.
one
of
the
generals
rode
up
to
napoleon
and
ventured
to
offer
to
lead
the
old
guard
into
action
.
ney
and
berthier
standing
near
napoleon
exchanged
looks
and
smiled
con
temptuously
at
this
generals
senseless
offer
.
napoleon
bowed
his
head
and
remained
si
lent
a
long
time
.
at
eight
hundred
leagues
from
france
i
will
not
have
my
guard
destroyed

he
said
and
turning
his
horse
rode
back

.
chapter
xxxv
on
the
rugcovered
bench
where
pierre
had
seen
him
in
the
morning
sat
kutuzov
his
gray
head
hanging
his
heavy
body
relaxed
.
he
gave
no
orders
but
only
assented
to
or
dis
sented
from
what
others
suggested
.
yes
yes
do
that
he
replied
to
various
proposals
.
yes
yes
go
dear
boy
and
have
a
look
he
would
say
to
one
or
another
of
those
about
him
or
no
dont
wed
better
wait
he
listened
to
the
reports
that
were
brought
him
and
gave
directions
when
his
subordinates
demanded
that
of
him
but
when
listening
to
the
reports
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
not
inter
ested
in
the
import
of
the
words
spoken
but
460
rather
in
something
elsein
the
expression
of
face
and
tone
of
voice
of
those
who
were
re
porting
.
by
long
years
of
military
experience
he
knew
and
with
the
wisdom
of
age
under
stood
that
it
is
impossible
for
one
man
to
direct
hundreds
of
thousands
of
others
strug
gling
with
death
and
he
knew
that
the
result
of
a
battle
is
decided
not
by
the
orders
of
a
commander
in
chief
nor
the
place
where
the
troops
are
stationed
nor
by
the
number
of
cannon
or
of
slaughtered
men
but
by
that
in
tangible
force
called
the
spirit
of
the
army
and
he
watched
this
force
and
guided
it
in
as
far
as
that
was
in
his
power
.
kutiizovs
general
expression
was
one
of
concentrated
quiet
attention
and
his
face
wore
a
strained
look
as
if
he
found
it
difficult
to
master
the
fatigue
of
his
old
and
feeble
body
.
at
eleven
oclock
they
brought
him
news
that
the
leches
captured
by
the
french
had
been
retaken
but
that
prince
bagration
was
wounded
.
kutiizov
groaned
and
swayed
his
head
.
ride
over
to
prince
peter
ivanovich
and
find
out
about
it
exactly
he
said
to
one
of
his
adjutants
and
then
turned
to
the
duke
of
wurttemberg
who
was
standing
behind
him
.
will
your
highness
please
take
command
of
the
first
army
soon
after
the
dukes
departure
before
he
could
possibly
have
reached
semenovsk
his
adjutant
came
back
from
him
and
told
kutii
zov
that
the
duke
asked
for
more
troops
.
kutuzov
made
a
grimace
and
sent
an
order
to
dokhtiirov
to
take
over
the
command
of
the
first
army
and
a
request
to
the
duke
whom
he
said
he
could
not
spare
at
such
an
important
moment
to
return
to
him
.
when
they
brought
him
news
that
murat
had
been
taken
prisoner
and
the
staff
officers
congratulated
him
ku
tuzov
smiled
.
wait
a
little
gentlemen
said
he
.
the
battle
is
won
and
there
is
nothing
extraordi
nary
in
the
capture
of
murat
.
still
it
is
better
to
wait
before
we
rejoice
.
but
he
sent
an
adjutant
to
take
the
news
round
the
army
.
when
scherbinin
came
galloping
from
the
left
flank
with
news
that
the
french
had
cap
tured
the
fleches
and
the
village
of
semenovsk
kutiizov
guessing
by
the
sounds
of
the
battle
and
by
scherbinins
looks
that
the
news
was
bad
rose
as
if
to
stretch
his
legs
and
taking
scherbinins
arm
led
him
aside
.
go
my
dear
fellow
he
said
to
erm61ov
and
see
whether
something
cant
be
done
.
war
and
peace
kutuzov
was
in
g6rki
near
the
center
of
the
russian
position
.
the
attack
directed
by
na
poleon
against
our
left
flank
had
been
several
times
repulsed
.
in
the
center
the
french
had
not
got
beyond
borodin6
and
on
their
left
flank
uvarovs
cavalry
had
put
the
french
to
flight
.
toward
three
oclock
the
french
attacks
ceased
.
on
the
faces
of
all
who
came
from
the
field
of
battle
and
of
those
who
stood
around
him
kutuzov
noticed
an
expression
of
extreme
tension
.
he
was
satisfied
with
the
days
success
a
success
exceeding
his
expectations
but
the
old
mans
strength
was
failing
him
.
several
times
his
head
dropped
low
as
if
it
were
falling
and
he
dozed
off
.
dinner
was
brought
him
.
adjutant
general
wolzogen
the
man
who
when
riding
past
prince
andrew
had
said
the
war
should
be
extended
widely
and
whom
bagrati6n
so
detested
rode
up
while
ku
tiizov
was
at
dinner
.
wolzogen
had
come
from
barclay
de
tolly
to
report
on
the
progress
of
affairs
on
the
left
flank
.
the
sagacious
barclay
de
tolly
seeing
crowds
of
wounded
men
run
ning
back
and
the
disordered
rear
of
the
army
weighed
all
the
circumstances
concluded
that
the
battle
was
lost
and
sent
his
favorite
officer
to
the
commander
in
chief
with
that
news
.
kutuzov
was
chew
ing
a
piece
of
roast
chicken
with
difficulty
and
glanced
at
wolzogen
with
eyes
that
brightened
under
their
puckering
lids
.
wolzogen
nonchalantly
stretching
his
legs
approached
kutuzov
with
a
halfcontemptu
ous
smile
on
his
lips
scarcely
touching
the
peak
of
his
cap
.
he
treated
his
serene
highness
with
a
some
what
affected
nonchalance
intended
to
show
that
as
a
highly
trained
military
man
he
left
it
to
russians
to
make
an
idol
of
this
useless
old
man
but
that
he
knew
whom
he
was
deal
ing
with
.
der
alte
herr
as
in
their
own
set
the
germans
called
kutuzov
is
making
him
self
very
comfortable
thought
wolzogen
and
looking
severely
at
the
dishes
in
front
of
ku
tuzov
he
began
to
report
to
the
old
gentle
man
the
position
of
affairs
on
the
left
flank
as
barclay
had
ordered
him
to
and
as
he
him
self
had
seen
and
understood
it
.
all
the
points
of
our
position
are
in
the
enemys
hands
and
we
cannot
dislodge
them
for
lack
of
troops
the
men
are
running
away
and
it
is
impossible
to
stop
them
he
re
ported
.
kutuzov
ceased
chewing
and
fixed
an
aston
ished
gaze
on
wolzogen
as
if
not
understand
ing
what
was
said
to
him
.
wolzogen
noticing
the
old
gentlemans
agitation
said
with
a
smile
i
have
not
considered
it
right
to
conceal
from
your
serene
highness
what
i
have
seen
.
the
troops
are
in
complete
disorder
.

.

.

.
you
have
seen
you
have
seen

.

.

.
kutii
zov
shouted
frowning
and
rising
quickly
he
went
up
to
wolzogen
.
how

.

.

.
how
dare
you

.

.

.
he
shouted
choking
and
making
a
threatening
gesture
with
his
trembling
arms
how
dare
you
sir
say
that
to
me
you
know
nothing
about
it
.
tell
general
barclay
from
me
that
his
infor
mation
is
incorrect
and
that
the
real
course
of
the
battle
is
better
known
to
me
the
com
mander
in
chief
than
to
him
.
wolzogen
was
about
to
make
a
rejoinder
but
kutuzov
interrupted
him
.
the
enemy
has
been
repulsed
on
the
left
and
defeated
on
the
right
flank
.
if
you
have
seen
amiss
sir
do
not
allow
yourself
to
say
what
you
dont
know
be
so
good
as
to
ride
to
general
barclay
and
inform
him
of
my
firm
intention
to
attack
the
enemy
tomorrow
said
kutuzov
sternly
.
all
were
silent
and
the
only
sound
audible
was
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
panting
old
general
.
they
are
repulsed
everywhere
for
which
i
thank
god
and
our
brave
army
the
enemy
is
beaten
and
tomorrow
we
shall
drive
him
from
the
sacred
soil
of
russia
said
kutuzov
cross
ing
himself
and
he
suddenly
sobbed
as
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
wolzogen
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
curl
ing
his
lips
stepped
silently
aside
marveling
at
the
old
gentlemans
conceited
stupidity
.
ah
here
he
is
my
hero
said
kutuzov
to
a
portly
handsome
darkhaired
general
who
was
just
ascending
the
knoll
.
this
was
raevski
who
had
spent
the
whole
day
at
the
most
important
part
of
the
field
of
borodin6
.
radvski
reported
that
the
troops
were
firmly
holding
their
ground
and
that
the
french
no
longer
ventured
to
attack
.
after
hearing
him
kutuzov
said
in
french
then
you
do
not
think
like
some
others
that
we
must
retreat
on
the
contrary
your
highness
in
inde
cisive
actions
it
is
always
the
most
stubborn
who
remain
victors
replied
ravski
and
in
my
opinion

.

.

.
kaysdrovl
kuttizov
called
to
his
adjutant
.
sit
down
and
write
out
the
order
of
the
day
book
ten
461
for
tomorrow
.
and
you
he
continued
address
ing
another
ride
along
the
line
and
an
nounce
that
tomorrow
we
attack
.
while
kutuzov
was
talking
to
ravski
and
dictating
the
order
of
the
day
wolzogen
re
turned
from
barclay
and
said
that
general
barclay
wished
to
have
written
confirmation
of
the
order
the
field
marshal
had
given
.
kutuzov
without
looking
at
wolzogen
gave
directions
ior
the
order
to
be
written
out
which
the
former
commander
in
chief
to
avoid
personal
responsibility
very
judiciously
wished
to
receive
.
and
by
means
of
that
mysterious
indefin
able
bond
which
maintains
throughout
an
army
one
and
the
same
temper
known
as
the
spirit
of
the
army
and
which
constitutes
the
chief
sinew
of
war
kutuzovs
words
his
order
for
a
battle
next
day
immediately
became
known
from
one
end
of
the
army
to
the
other
.
it
was
far
from
being
the
same
woids
or
the
same
order
that
reached
the
farthest
links
of
that
chain
.
the
tales
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
at
different
ends
of
the
army
did
not
even
resemble
what
kutuzov
had
said
but
the
sense
of
his
words
spread
everywhere
because
what
he
said
was
not
the
outcome
of
cunning
calculations
but
of
a
feeling
that
lay
in
the
commander
in
chiefs
soul
as
in
that
of
every
russian
.
and
on
learning
that
tomorrow
they
were
to
attack
the
enemy
and
hearing
from
the
high
est
quarters
a
confirmation
of
what
they
wanted
to
believe
the
exhausted
wavering
men
felt
comforted
and
inspirited
.
chapter
xxxvi

regiment
was
among
the
re
serves
which
till
after
one
oclock
were
stationed
inactive
behind
semenovsk
under
heavy
artil
lery
fire
.
toward
two
oclock
the
regiment
having
already
lost
more
than
two
hundred
men
was
moved
forward
into
a
trampled
oat
field
in
the
gap
between

where
thousands
of
men
per

on

an

fire
from
several
hundred

guns
was
directed
between
one
and
two
oclock
.
without
moving
from
that
spot
or
firing
a

shot
the
regiment
here
lost
another

from

unceasingly

at
times
as
if
to
allow
them
a
respite
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
during
which
the
cannon
balls
and
shells
all
flew
overhead
but
sometimes
several
men
were
torn
from
the
regiment
in
a
minute
and
the
slain
were
continually
being
dragged
away
and
the
wounded
carried
off
.
with
each
fresh
blow
less
and
less
chance
of
life
remained
for
those
not
yet
killed
.
the
regiment
stood
in
columns
of
battalion
three
hundred
paces
apart
but
nevertheless
the
men
were
always
in
one
and
the
same
mood
.
all
alike
were
taciturn
and
morose
.
talk
was
rarely
heard
in
the
ranks
and
it
ceased
alto
gether
every
time
the
thud
of
a
successful
shot
and
the
cry
of
stretchers
was
heard
.
most
of
the
time
by
their
officers
order
the
men
sat
on
the
ground
.
one

taken
off
his

of

ing

pulled

of

while
an
other
smoothed
and
refolded
his
leg

and
put
his
boots
on
again
.
some
built
little
houses
of
the
tufts
in
the
plowed
ground
or
plaited
baskets
from
the
straw
in
the
cornfield
.
all
seemed
fully
absorbed
in
these
pursuits
.
when
men
were
killed
or
wounded
when
rows
of
stretchers
went
past
when
some
troops
re
treated
and
when
great
masses
of
the
enemy
came
into
view
through
the
smoke
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
these
things
.
but
when
our
artillery
or
cavalry
advanced
or
some
of
our
infantry
were
seen
to
move
forward
words
of
approval
were
heard
on
all
sides
.
but
the
liveliest
attention
was
attracted
by
occurrences
quite
apart
from
and
unconnected
with
the
battle
.
it
was
as
if
the
minds
of
these
morally
exhausted
men
found
relief
in
everyday
com
monplace
occurrences
.
a
battery
of
artillery
was
passing
in
front
of
the
regiment
.
the
horse
of
an
ammunition
cart
put
its
leg
over
a
trace

came
identical
shouts
from
the
ranks
all
along
the
regiment
.
another
time
general
at
tention
was
attracted
by
a
small
brown
dog
coming
heaven
knows
whence
which
trotted
in
a
preoccupied
manner
in
front
of
the
ranks
with
tail
stiffly
erect
till
suddenly
a
shell
fell
close
by
when
it
yelped
tucked
its
tail
be
tween
its
legs
and
darted
aside
.
yells
and
shrieks
of
laughter
rose
from
the
whole
regi
ment
.
but
such
distractions
lasted
only
a
mo
ment
and
for
eight
hours
the
men
had
been
war
and
peace
inactive
without
food
in
constant
fear
of
death
and
their
pale
and
gloomy
faces
grew
ever
paler
and
gloomier
.
prince
andrew
pale
and
gloomy
like
every
one
in
the
regiment
paced
up
and
down
from
the
border
of
one
patch
to
another
at
the
edge
of
the
meadow
beside
an
oatfield
with
head
bowed
and
arms
behind
his
back
.
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
and
no
orders
to
be
given
.
everything
went
on
of
itself
.
the
killed
were
dragged
from
the
front
the
wounded
carried
away
and
the
ranks
closed
up
.
if
any
soldiers
ran
to
the
rear
they
returned
immedi
ately
and
hastily
.
at

sidering

duty
to
rouse
the
courage
of
the
men
and
to

them

example
walked
about
among
the
ranks
but
he
soon
became
con
vinced
that
this
was
unnecessary
and
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
teach
them
.
all
the
pow
ers
of
his
soul
as
of
every
soldier
there
were
unconsciously
bent
on
avoiding
the
contem
plation
of
the
horrors
of
their
situation
.
he
walked
along
the
meadow
dragging
his
feet
rustling
the
grass
and
gazing
at
the
dust
that
covered
his
boots
now
he
took
big
strides
try
ing
to
keep
to
the
footprints
left
on
the
mead
ow
by
the
mowers
then
he
counted
his
steps
calculating
how
often
he
must
walk
from
one
strip
to
another
to
walk
a
mile
then
he
stripped
the
flowers
from
the
wormwood
that
grew
a
long
a
boundary
rut
rubbed
them
in
his
palms
and
smelled
their
pungent
sweetly
bitter
scent
.
nothing
remained
of
the
previous
days
thoughts
.
he
thought
of
nothing
.
he
listened
with
weary
ears
to
the
everrecurring
sounds
distinguishing
the
whistle
of
flying
projectiles
from
the
booming
of
the
reports
glanced
at
the
tiresomely
familiar
faces
of
the
men
of
the
first
battalion
and
waited
.

he
stopped
and

but
this
one
has

and
again
he
started
trying
to
reach
the

in
sixteen
paces
.
a
whizz
and
a
thud
five
paces
from
him
a
cannon

tore
up
the
dry

and
disappeared
.
a
chill
ran
down
his

at
the

at

a

of
splinters
as
from
a

dow

a
suffocating
smell
of
powder
and
prince
andrew
started
to
one

raising
his

and
fell
on

.
several
officers
ran
up
to
him
.
from
the

blood
was
welling
out
making
a

the

had
trodden
down
to
the

those

an

seizing
by

were
walking
unevenly
and
jolting
the

when

your
excellency
eh
prince
said
the
trembling
voice
of
tim6khin
who
had
run
up
and
was
looking
down
on
the
stretcher
.
prince
andrew
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
up
at
the
speaker
from
the
stretcher
into
which
his
head
had
sunk
deep
and
again
his
eyelids
drooped
.
the
militiamen
carried
prince
andrew
to
the
dressing
station
by
the
wood
where
wagons
were
stationed
.
the
dressing
station
consisted
of
three
tents
with
flaps
turned
back
pitched
at
the
edge
of
a
birch
wood
.
in
the
wood
wag
ons
and
horses
were
standing
.
the
horses
were
eating
oats
from
their
movable
troughs
and
sparrows
flew
down
and
peeked
the
grains
that
fell
.
some
crows
scenting
blood
flew
among
the
birch
trees
cawing
impatiently
.
around
the
tents
over
more
than
five
acres
blood
stained
men
in
various
garbs
stood
sat
or
lay
.
around
the
wounded
stood
crowds
of
soldier
stretcherbearers
with
dismal
and
attentive
faces
whom
the
officers
keeping
order
tried
in
vain
to
drive
from
the
spot
.
disregarding
the
officers
orders
the
soldiers
stood
leaning
against
their
stretchers
and
gazing
intently
as
if
trying
to
comprehend
the
difficult
problem
of
what
was
taking
place
before
them
.
from
the
tents
came
now
loud
angry
cries
and
now
plaintive
groans
.
occasionally
dressers
ran
out
to
fetch
water
or
to
point
out
those
who
were
to
be
brought
in
next
.
the
wounded
men
awaiting
their
turn
outside
the
tents
groaned
sighed
wept
screamed
swore
or
asked
for
vodka
.
some
were
delirious

prince

bearers
stepping
over
the
wounded
who
had
not
yet
been
bandaged
took
him
as
a
regi
mental
commander
close
up
to
one
of
the
tents
and
there
stopped
awaiting
instructions
.
prince
andrew
opened
his
eyes
and
for
a
long
time
could
not
make
out
what
was
going
on
around
him
.
he
remembered
the
meadow
the
wormwood
the
field
the
whirling
black
ball
and
his
sudden
rush
of
passionate
love
of
life
.
two
steps
from
him
leaning
against
a
branch
and
talking
loudly
and
attracting

attention
stood
a

chapter
xxxvii
one
of
the
doctors
came
out
of
the
tent
in
a
bloodstained
apron
holding
a
cigar
between
the
thumb
and
little
finger
of
one
of
his
small
bloodstained
hands
so
as
not
to
smear
it
.
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
about
him
but
above
the
level
of
the
wounded
men
.
he
evi
dently
wanted
a
little
respite
.
after
turning
his
head
from
right
to
left
for
some
time
he
sighed
and
looked
down
.
all
right
immediately
he
replied
to
a
dresser
who
pointed
prince
andrew
out
to
him
and
he
told
them
to
carry
him
into
the
tent
.
murmurs
arose
among
the
wounded
who
were
waiting
.
it
seems
that
even
in
the
next
world
only
the
gentry
are
to
have
a
chance
remarked
one
.
prince
andrew
was
carried
in
and
laid
on
a
table
that
had
only
just
been
cleared
and
which
a
dresser
was
washing
down
.
prince
andrew
could
not
make
out
distinctly
what
was
in
that
tent
.
the
pitiful
groans
from
all
sides
and
the
torturing
pain
in
his
thigh
stomach
and
back
distracted
him
.
all
he
saw
about
him
merged
into
a
general
impression
of
naked
bleeding
human
bodies
that
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
of
the
low
tent
as
a
few
weeks
previously
on
that
hot
august
day
such
bodies
had
filled
the
dirty
pond
beside
the
smolensk
road
.
yes
it
was
the
same
flesh
the
same
chair

canon
the
sight
of
which
had
even
then
filled
him
with
horror
as
by
a
presentiment
.
there
were
three
operating
tables
in
the
tent
.
two
were
occupied
and
on
the
third
they
placed
prince
andrew
for
a
little
while
he
was
left
alone
and
involuntarily
witnessed
what
was
taking
place
on
the
other
two
tables
.
on
the
nearest
one
sat
a
tartar
probably
a
cossack
judging
by
the
uniform
thrown
down
beside
him
.
four
soldiers
were
holding
him
and
a
spectacled
doctor
was
cutting
into
his
muscular
brown
back
.
ooh
ooh
oohl
grunted
the
tartar
and
suddenly
lifting
up
his
swarthy
snubnosed
face
with
its
high
cheekbones
and
baring
his
white
teeth
he
began
to
wriggle
and
twitch
his
body
and
utter
piercing
ringing
and
pro
longed
yells
.
on
the
other
table
round
which
many
people
were
crowding
a
tall
wellfed
man
lay
on
his
back
with
his
head
thrown
back
.
his
curly
hair
its
color
and
the
shape
of
his
head
seemed
strangely
familiar
to
prince
andrew
.
several
dressers
were
pressing
on
his
chest
to
hold
him
down
.
one
large
white
plump
leg
twitched
rapidly
all
the
time
with
a
feverish
tremor
.
the
man
was
sobbing
and
choking
convulsively
.
two
doctors
one
of
whom
was
pale
and
trembling
were
silently
doing
something
to
this
mans
other
gory
leg
.
when
he
had
finished
with
the
tartar
whom
they
covered
with
an
overcoat
the
spectacled
doctor
came
up
to
prince
andrew
wiping
his
hands
.
he
glanced
at
prince
andrews
face
and
quickly
turned
away
.
undress
him
what
are
you
waiting
for
he
cried
angrily
to
the
dressers
.
his
very
first
remotest
recollections
of
child
hood
came
back
to
prince
andrews
mind
when
the
dresser
with
sleeves
rolled
up
began
hastily
to
undo
the
buttons
of
his
clothes
and
un
dressed
him
.
the
doctor
bent
down
over
the
wound
felt
it
and
sighed
deeply
.
then
he
made
a
sign
to
someone
and
the
torturing
pain
in
his
abdomen
caused
prince
andrew
to
lose
consciousness
.
when
he
came
to
himself
the
splintered
portions
of
his
thighbone
had
been
extracted
the
torn
flesh
cut
away
and
the
wound
bandaged
.
water
was
being
sprinkled
on
his
face
.
as
soon
as
prince
andrew
opened
his
eyes
the
doctor
bent
over
kissed
him
silent
ly
on
the
lips
and
hurried
away
.
after
the
sufferings
he
had
been
enduring
prince
andrew
enjoyed
a
blissful
feeling
such
as
he
had
riot
experienced
for
a
long
time
.
all
the
best
and
happiest
moments
of
his
life
es
pecially
his
earliest
childhood

the
terrible
spectacle
of
the
battlefield
cov
ered
with
dead
and
wounded
together
with
the
heaviness
of
his
head
and
the
news
that
some
twenty
generals
he
knew
personally
had
been
killed
or
wounded
and
the
consciousness
of
the
impotence
of
his
once
mighty
arm
pro
duced
an
unexpected
impression
on
napoleon
who
usually
liked
to
look
at
the
killed
and
wounded
thereby
he
considered
testing
his
strength
of
mind
.
this
day
the
horrible
ap
pearance
of
the
battlefield
overcame
that
strength
of
mind
which
he
thought
constitut
ed
his
merit
and
his
greatness
.
he
rode
hurried
ly
from
the
battlefield
and
returned
to
the
she
vardino
knoll
where
he
sat
on
his
campstool
his
sallow
face
swollen
and
heavy
his
eyes
dim
his
nose
red
and
his
voice
hoarse
involunta
rily
listening
with
downcast
eyes
to
the
sounds
of
firing
.
with
painful
dejection
he
awaited
the
end
of
this
action
in
which
he
regarded
himself
as
a
participant
and
which
he
was
un
able
to
arrest
.
a
personal
human
feeling
for
a
brief
moment
got
the
better
of
the
artificial
phantasm
of
life
he
had
served
so
long
.
he
felt
in
his
own
person
the
sufferings
and
death
he
had
witnessed
on
the
battlefield
.
the
heavi
ness
of
his
head
and
chest
reminded
him
of
the
possibility
of
suffering
and
death
for
himself
.
at
that
moment
he
did
not
desire
moscow
or
victory
or
glory
what
need
had
he
for
any
more
glory
.
the
one
thing
he
wished
for
was
rest
tranquillity
and
freedom
.
but
when
he
had
been
on
the
semenovsk
heights
the
artil
lery
commander
had
proposed
to
him
to
bring
several
batteries
of
artillery
up
to
those
heights
to
strengthen
the
fire
on
the
russian
troops
crowded
in
front
of
knyazkovo
.
napoleon
had
assented
and
had
given
orders
that
news
should
be
brought
him
of
the
effect
those
batteries
produced
.
an
adjutant
came
now
to
inform
him
that
the
fire
of
two
hundred
guns
had
been
concen
trated
on
the
russians
as
he
had
ordered

in

the

who
had

the
remark

frowning

let
them
have
it
even
before
he
gave
that
order
the
thing
he
did
not
desire
and
for
which
he
gave
the
order
only
because
he
thought
it
was
expected
of
him
was
being
done
.
and
he
fell
back
into
that
artificial
realmof
imaginary
greatness
and
againas
a
horse
walking
a
treadmill

it
is
doing

for

he
submissive
ly
fulfilled
the
cruel
sad
gloomy
and
inhuman
role
predestined
for
him
.
and
not
for
that
day
and
hour
alone
were
the
mind
and
conscience
darkened
of
this
man
on
whom
the
responsibility
for
what
was
happen
ing
lay
more
than
on
all
the
others
who
took
part
in
it
.
never
to
the
end
of
his
life
could
he
understand
goodness
beauty
or
truth
or
the
significance
of
his
actions
which
were
too
con
trary
to
goodness
and
truth
too
remote
from
everything
human
for
him
ever
to
be
able
to
grasp
their
meaning
.
he
could
not
disavow
his
actions
belauded
as
they
were
by
half
the
world
and
so
he
had
to
repudiate
truth
goodness
and
all
humanity
.
not
only
on
that
day
as
he
rode
over
the
battlefield
strewn
with
men
killed
and
maimed
by
his
will
as
he
believed
did
he
reckon
as
he
looked
at
them
how
many
russians
there
were
for
each
frenchman
and
deceiving
him
self
find
reason
for
rejoicing
in
the
calculation
that
there
were
five
russians
for
every
french
man
.
not
on
that
day
alone
did
he
write
in
a
letter
to
paris
that
the
battlefield
was
superb
because
fifty
thousand
corpses
lay
there

the

flew
just
as
swiftly
and
cruelly
from
both
sides
crushing
human
bod
ies
and
that
terrible
work
which
was
not
done
by
the
will
of
a
man
but
at
the
will
of
him
who
governs
men
and
worlds
continued
.
anyone
looking
at
the
disorganized
rear
of
the
russian
army
would
have
said
that
if
only
the
french
made
one
more
slight
effort
it
would
disappear
and
anyone
looking
at
the
rear
of
the
french
army
would
have
said
that
the
russians
need
only
make
one
more
slight
effort
and
the
french
would
be
destroyed
.
but
neither
the
french
nor
the
russians
made
that
effort
and
the
flame
of
battle
burned
slowly
out
.
the
russians
did
not
make
that
effort
be
cause
they
were
not
attacking
the
french

at
the

blocking

they
still
did
so
at

at

but
even
had
the
aim
of

they
could

all
their

with
the
consciousness
that
they
had
captured
part
of

a
quarter
of

men
and
still

their
guards
intact
twenty

have
made

effort
.
the
french
who
had
attacked
the
russian
army
in
order
to
drive
it
from
its
position
ought
to
have
made
that
effort
for
as
long
as
the
russians
continued
to
block
the
road
to
moscow
as
before
the
aim
of
the
french
had
not
been
attained
and
all
their
efforts
and
losses
were
in
vain
.
but
the
french
did
not
make
that
effort
.
some
historians
say
that
napoleon
need
only
have
used
his
old
guards
who
were
intact

the
battle
would
have

whether

laws
of
motion
of
any
kind
become
comprehensible
to
man
only
when
he
examines
arbitrarily
selected
el
ements
of
that
motion
but
at
the
same
time
a
large
proportion
of
human
error
comes
from
the
arbitrary
division
of
continuous
motion
into
discontinuous
elements
.
there
is
a
well
known
socalled
sophism
of
the
ancients
con
sisting
in
this
that
achilles
could
never
catch
up
with
a
tortoise
he
was
following
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
traveled
ten
times
as
fast
as
the
tortoise
.
by
the
time
achilles
has
covered
the
distance
that
separated
him
from
the
tortoise
the
tortoise
has
covered
one
tenth
of
that
dis
tance
ahead
of
him
when
achilles
has
covered
that
tenth
the
tortoise
has
covered
another
one
hundredth
and
so
on
forever
.
this
problem
seemed
to
the
ancients
insoluble
.
the
absurd
answer
that
achilles
could
never
overtake
the
tortoise
resulted
from
this
that
motion
was
arbitrarily
divided
into
discontinuous
ele
ments
whereas
the
motion
both
of
achilles
and
of
the
tortoise
was
continuous
.
by
adopting
smaller
and
smaller
elements
of
motion
we
only
approach
a
solution
of
the
problem
but
never
reach
it
.
only
when
we
have
admitted
the
conception
of
the
infinite
ly

and
the
resulting
geometrical
pro
gression
with
a
common
ratio
of
one

have
found
the

to

we
reach

this
modern
branch
of
mathematics
un
known
to
the
ancients
when
dealing
with

admits
the
conception
of

so
conforms
to
the
chief
condition

thereby
corrects
the
inevitable
error

the

cannot
avoid

with

in

of
examining

in
seeking
the
laws
of
historical
movement
just
the
same
thing
happens
.
the
movement
of
humanity
arising
as
it
does
from
innumerable
arbitrary
human
wills
is
continuous
.
to
understand
the
laws
of
this
continuous
movement
is
the
aim
of
history
.
but
to
arrive
at
these
laws
resulting
from
the
sum
of
all
those
human
wills
mans
mind
postulates
arbitrary
and
disconnected
units
.
the
first
method
of
history
is
to
take
an
arbitrarily
selected
series
of
continuous
events
and
examine
it
apart
from
others
though
there
is
and
can
be
no
be
ginning
to
any
event
for
one
event
always
flows
uninterruptedly
from
another
.
the
second
method
is
to
consider
the
ac
tions
of
some
one
man
a
king
or
a
command
eras
equivalent
to
the
sum
of
many
individ
ual
wills
whereas
the
sum
of
individual
wills
is
never
expressed
by
the
activity
of
a
single
his
toric
personage
.
historical
science
in
its
endeavor
to
draw
nearer
to
truth
continually
takes
smaller
and
smaller
units
for
examination
.
but
however
small
the
units
it
takes
we
feel
that
to
take
any
unit
disconnected
from
others
or
to
as
sume
a
beginning
of
any
phenomenon
or
to
say
that
the
will
of
many
men
is
expressed
by
the
actions
of
any
one
historic
personage
is
in
itself
false
.
it
needs
no
critical
exertion
to
reduce
utter
ly
to
dust
any
deductions
drawn
from
history
.
it
is
merely
necessary
to
select
some
larger
or
smaller
unit
as
the
subject
of
observation
as
criticism
has
every
right
to
do
seeing
that
whatever
unit
history
observes
must
always
be
arbitrarily
selected
.
only
by
taking
infinitesimally
small
units
for
observation
the
differential
of
history
that
is
the
individual
tendencies
of
men
and
attaining
to
the
art
of
integrating
them
that
is
finding
the
sum
of
these
infinitesimals
can
we
hope
to
arrive
at
the

the

one
another

are
plunged
in
de
spair
and
for
some
years
the
whole
course
of
life
is
altered
and
presents
an
intensive
move
ment
which
first
increases
and
then
slackens
.
what
was
the
cause
of
this
movement
by
what
laws
was
it
governed
asks
the
mind
of
man
.
the
historians
replying
to
this
question
lay
before
us
the
sayings
and
doings
of
a
few
dozen
men
in
a
building
in
the
city
of
paris
calling
these
sayings
and
doings
the
revolution
then
they
give
a
detailed
biography
of
napo
leon
and
of
certain
people
favorable
or
hostile
to
him
tell
of
the
influence
some
of
these
peo
ple
had
on
others
and
say
that
is
why
this
movement
took
place
and
those
are
its
laws
.
but
the
mind
of
man
not
only
refuses
to
be
lieve
this
explanation
but
plainly
says
that
this
method
of
explanation
is
fallacious
be
cause
in
it
a
weaker
phenomenon
is
taken
as
the
cause
of
a
stronger
.
the
sum
of
human
wills
produced
the
revolution
and
napoleon
and
only
the
sum
of
those
wills
first
tolerated
and
then
destroyed
them
.

every

there
have
been

there
have
been

indeed
hu

replies
every

there
have
been

but
this
does
not
prove
that
the
conquerors
caused
the
wars
and
that
it
is
possible
to
find
the
laws
of
a
war
in
the
personal
activity
of
a
single
man
.
when
ever
i
look
at
my
watch
and
its
hands
point
to
ten
i
hear
the
bells
of
the
neighbor
ing
church
but
because
the
bells
begin
to
ring
when
the
hands
of
the
clock
reach
ten
i
have
no
right
to
assume
that
the
movement
of
the
bells
is
caused
by
the
position
of
the
hands
of
the
watch
.
whenever
i
see
the
movement
of
a
locomo
tive
i
hear
the
whistle
and
see
the
valves
open
ing
and
wheels
turning
but
i
have
no
right
to
conclude
that
the
whistling
and
the
turning
of
wheels
are
the
cause
of
the
movement
of
the
engine
.
the
peasants
say
that
a
cold
wind
blows
in
late
spring
because
the
oaks
are
budding
and
really
every
spring
cold
winds
do
blow
when
the
oak
is
budding
.
but
though
i
do
not
know
what
causes
the
cold
winds
to
blow
when
the
oak
buds
unfold
i
cannot
agree
with
the
peas
ants
that
the
unfolding
of
the
oak
buds
is
the
war
and
peace
cause
of
the
cold
wind
for
the
force
of
the
wind
is
beyond
the
influence
of
the
buds
.
i
see
only
a
coincidence
of
occurrences
such
as
hap
pens
with
all
the
phenomena
of
life
and
i
see
that
however
much
and
however
carefully
i
observe
the
hands
of
the
watch
and
the
valves
and
wheels
of
the
engine
and
the
oak
i
shall
not
discover
the
cause
of
the
bells
ringing
the
engine
moving
or
of
the
winds
of
spring
.
todo
that
i
must
entirely
change
my
point
of
view
and
study
the
laws
of
the
movement
of
steam
of
the
bells
and
of
the
wind
.
history
must
do
the
same
.
and
attempts
in
this
direction
have
already
been
made
.
to
study
the
laws
of
history
we
must
com
pletely
change
the
subject
of
our
observation
must
leave
aside
kings
ministers
and
generals
and
study
the
common
infmitcsimally
small
elements
by
which
the
masses
are
moved
.
no
one
can
say
in
how
far
it
is
possible
for
man
to
advance
in
this
way
toward
an
understanding
of
the
laws
of
history
but
it
is
evident
that
on
ly
along
that
path
does
the
possibility
of
discov
ering
the
laws
of
history
lie
and
that
as
yet
not
a
millionth
part
as
much
mental
effort
has
been
applied
in
this
direction
by
historians

has
been
devoted
to
describing
the

reported

he
gave
orders
to
prepare
for
a
fresh
conflict
to
finish
the
enemy
and
did
this
not
to
deceive
anyone
but
because
he
knew
that
the
enemy
was
beat

as
everyone
who
had
taken

in

knew
it

all

came

the
activity
of
a
commander
in

does
not
at
all
resemble
the
activity
we
imagine
to
ourselves

we
sit
at

some
campaign
on

a

at

tinuous

the
commander

is
in
the

of
a
most
complex
play
of
intrigues

projects
counsels

deceptions

is
continually

to

to
innumerable
questions
addressed
to
him
which
constantly
conflict
with
one
another

learned
military
authorities
quite
seriously
tell
us
that
kutuzov
should
have
moved
his
ar
my
to
the
kaluga
road
long
before
reaching
fih
and
that
somebody
actually
submitted
such
a
proposal
to
him
.
but
a
commander
in
chief
especially
at
a
difficult
moment
has
al
ways
before
him
not
one
proposal
but
dozens
simultaneously
.
and
all
these
proposals
based
on
strategics
and
tactics
contradict
each
other
.
a
commander
in
chiefs
business
it
would
seem
is
simply
to
choose
one
of
these
projects
.
but
even
that
he
cannot
do
.
events
and
time
do
not
wait
.
for
instance
on
the
twentyeighth
it
is
suggested
to
him
to
cross
to
the
kaluga
road
but
just
then
an
adjutant
gallops
up
from
milorddovich
asking
whether
he
is
to
engage
the
french
or
retire
.
an
order
must
be
given
him
at
once
that
instant
.
and
the
order
to
re
treat
carries
us
past
the
turn
to
the
kaluga
road
.
and
after
the
adjutant
comes
the
com
missary
general
asking
where
the
stores
are
to

war
and
peace
be
taken
and
the
chief
of
the
hospitals
asks
where
the
wounded
are
to
go
and
a
courier
from
petersburg
brings
a
letter
from
the
sov
ereign
which
does
not
admit
of
the
possibility
of
abandoning
moscow
and
the
commander
in
chiefs
rival
the
man
who
is
undermining
him
and
there
are
always
not
merely
one
but
several
such
presents
a
new
project
diametri
cally
opposed
to
that
of
turning
to
the
kaluga
road
and
the
commander
in

himself
needs
sleep
and
refreshment
to
maintain
his
energy
and
a
respectable
general
who
has
been
overlooked
in
the
distribution
of
rewards
comes
to
complain
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
pray
to
be
defended
and
an
officer
sent
to
inspect
the
locality
comes
in
and
gives
a
re
port
quite
contrary
to
what
was
said
by
the
officer

and
a
spy
a
prisoner
and
a
general
who
has
been
on
reconnaissance
all
describe
the
position
of
the
enemys
army
differently
.
people
accustomed
to
misunder
stand
or
to
forget
these
inevitable
conditions
of
a
commander
in
chiefs
actions
describe
to
us
for
instance
the
position
of
the
army
at
fill
and
assume
that
the
commander
in
chief
could
on
the
first
of
september
quite
freely
decide
whether
to
abandon
moscow
or
defend
it
whereas
with
the
russian
army
less
than
four
miles
from
moscow
no
such
question
existed
.
when
had
that
question
been
settled
at
drissa
and
at
smolensk
and
most
palpably
of
all
on
the
twentyfourth
of
august
at
she

and
on

at

chapter
iii
when
ermolov
having
been
sent
by
kutuzov
to
inspect
the
position
told
the
field
marshal
that
it
was
impossible
to
fight
there
before
moscow
and
that
they
must
retreat
kutuzov
looked
at
him
in
silence
.
give
me
your
hand
said
he
and
turning
it
over
so
as
to
feel
the
pulse
added
you
are
not
well
my
dear
fellow
.
think
what
you
are
saying
kutuzov
could
not
yet
admit
the
possibility
of
retreating
beyond
moscow
without
a
battle
.
on
the
poklonny
hill
four
miles
from
the
dorogomilov
gate
of
moscow
kutuzov
got
out
of
his
carriage
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
by
the
roadside
.
a
great
crowd
of
generals
gathered
round
him
and
count
rostopchin
who
had
come
out
from
moscow
joined
them
.
this
brilliant
company
separated
into
several
groups
who
all
discussed
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
position
the
state
of
the
army
the
plans
suggested
the
situation
of
moscow
and
military
questions
generally
.
though
they
had
not
been
summoned
for
the
purpose
and
though
it
was
not
so
called
they
all
felt
that
this
was
really
a
council
of
war
.
the
conversations
all
dealt
with
public
ques
tions
.
if
anyone
gave
or
asked
for
personal
news
it
was
done
in
a
whisper
and
they
im
mediately
reverted
to
general
matters
.
no
jokes
or
laughter
or
smiles
even
were
seen
among
all
these
men
.
they
evidently
all
made
an
ef
fort
to
hold
themselves
at
the
height
the
situa
tion
demanded
.
and
all
these
groups
while
talking
among
themselves
tried
to
keep
near
the
commander
in
chief
whose
bench
formed
the
center
of
the
gathering
and
to
speak
so
that
he
might
overhear
them
.
the
commander
in
chief
listened
to
what
was
being
said
and
sometimes
asked
them
to
repeat
their
remarks
but
did
not
himself
take
part
in
the
conversa
tions
or
express
any
opinion
.
after
hearing
what
was
being
said
by
one
or
other
of
these
groups
he
generally
turned
away
with
an
air
of
disappointment
as
though
they
were
not
speaking
of
anything
he
wished
to
hear
.
some
discussed
the
position
that
had
been
chosen
criticizing
not
the
position
itself
so
much
as
the
mental
capacity
of
those
who
had
chosen
it
.
others
argued
that
a
mistake
had
been
made
earlier
and
that
a
battle
should
have
been
fought
two
days
before
.
others
again
spoke
of
the
battle
of
salamanca
which
was
described
by
crosart
a
newly
arrived
frenchman
in
a
spanish
uniform
.
this
frenchman
and
one
of
the
german
princes
serving
with
the
rus
sian
army
were
discussing
the
siege
of
sara
gossaand
considering
the
possibility
of
defend
ing
moscow
in
a
similar
manner
.
count
ros
topchin
was
telling
a
fourth
group
that
he
was
prepared
to
die
with
the
city
train
bands
under
the
walls
of
the
capital
but
that
he
still
could
not
help
regretting
having
been
left
in
igno
rance
of
what
was
happening
and
that
had
he
known
it
sooner
things
would
have
been
dif
ferent
.

..
.
a
fifth
group
displaying
the
pro
fundity
of
their
strategic
perceptions
discussed
the
direction
the
troops
would
now
have
to
take
.
a
sixth
group
was
talking
absolute
non
sense
.
kutiizovs
expression
grew
more
and
more
preoccupied
and
gloomy
.
from
all
this
talk
he
sawonly
one
thing
that
to
defend
mos
cow
was
a
physical
impossibility
in
the
full
meaning
of
those
words
that
is
to
say
so
ut
terly
impossible
that
if
any
senseless
command
er
were
to
give
orders
to
fight
confusion
would
result
but
the
battle
would
still
not
take
place
.
it
would
not
take
place
because
the
command
ers
not
merely
all
recognized
the
position
to
be
impossible
but
in
their
conversations
were
only
discussing
what
would
happen
after
its
inevitable
abandonment
.
how
could
the
com
manders
lead
their
troops
to
a
field
of
battle
they
considered
it
impossible
to
hold
the
lowergrade
officers
and
even
the
soldiers
who
too
reason
also
considered
the
position
im
possible
and
therefore
could
not
go
to
fight
fully
convinced
as
they
were
of
defeat
.
if
ben
nigsen
insisted
on
the
position
being
defended
and
others
still
discussed
it
the
question
was
no
longer
important
in
itself
but
only
as
a
pre
text
for
disputes
and
intrigue
.
this
kutuzov
knew
well
.
bennigsen
who
had
chosen
the
position
warmly
displayed
his
russian
patriotism
ku
tuzov
could
not
listen
to
this
without
wincing
by
insisting
that
moscow
must
be
defended
.
his
aim
was
as
clear
as
daylight
to
kutuzov
if
the
defense
failed
to
throw
the
blame
on
ku
tuzov
who
had
brought
the
army
as
far
as
the
sparrow
hills
without
giving
battle
if
it
suc
ceeded
to
claim
the
success
as
his
own
or
if
battle
were
not
given
to
clear
himself
of
the
crime
of
abandoning
moscow
.
but
this
intrigue
did
not
now
occupy
the
old
mans
mind
.
one
terrible
question
absorbed
him
and
to
that
question
he
heard
no
reply
from
anyone
.
the
question
for
him
now
was
have
i
really
al
lowed
napoleon
to
reach
moscow
and
when
did
i
do
so
when
was
it
decided
can
it
have
been
yesterday
when
i
ordered
platov
to
retreat
or
was
it
the
evening
before
when
i
had
a
nap
and
told
bennigsen
to
issue
orders
or
was
it
earlier
still

.

.

.
when
when
was
this
terrible
affair
decided
moscow
must
be
abandoned
.
the
army
must
retreat
and
the
order
to
do
so
must
be
given
.
to
give
that
terrible
order
seemed
to
him
equivalent
to
resign
ing
the
com
mand
of
the
army
.
and
not
only
did
he
love
power
to
which
he
was
accustomed
the
hon
ours
awarded
to
prince
prozorovski
under
whom
he
had
served
in
turkey
galled
him
but
he
was
convinced
that
he
was
destined
to
save
russia
and
that
that
was
why
against
the
emperors
wish
and
by
the
will
of
the
people
he
had
been
chosen
commander
in
chief
.
he
was
convinced
that
he
alone
could
maintain
command
of
the
army
in
these
difficult
cir
cumstances
and
that
in
all
the
world
he
alone
could
encounter
the
invincible
napoleon
with
out
fear
and
he
was
horrified
at
the
thought
of
the
order
he
had
to
issue
.
but
something
had
book
eleven
473
to
be
decided
and
these
conversations
around
him
which
were
assuming
too
free
a
character
must
be
stopped
.
he
called
the
most
important
generals
to
him
.
my
head
be
it
good
or
bad
must
depend
on
itself
said
he
rising
from
the
bench
and
he
rode
to
fill
where
his
carriages
were
wait
ing
.
chapter
iv
the
council
of
war
began
to
assemble
at
two
in
the
afternoon
in
the
better
and
roomier
part
of
andrew

.
the
men

into

while
drinking
his
tea
remained
on
the
top
of
the

in

with

at
the

and
decorations
of
the
generals
who
one
after
another
came
into
the
room
and
sat
clown
on
the
broad
benches
in
the
corner
under
the
icons
.
grand

as

sat
sunk
deep
in
a
folding
armchair
and
continually
cleared
his
throat
and
pulled
at
the
collar
of
his
coat
which
though
it
was
unbuttoned
still
seemed
to
pinch
his
neck
.
those
who
entered
went
up
one
by
one
to
the
field
marshal
he
pressed
the
hands
of
some
and
nodded
to
others
.
his
ad
jutant
kaysarov
was
about
to
draw
back
the
curtain
of
the
window
facing
kutuzov
but
the
latter
moved
his
hand
angrily
and
kaysdrov
understood
that
his
serene
highness
did
not
wish
his
face
to
be
seen
.

put

and

who
had
just
arrived
sat
down
on

in
the
foremost
place
immediately
under

sat

his
high
forehead
merging
into
his

crown
.
he
had
a

cross
round
his
neck
and
looked
pale
and
ill
.
he
had
been
feverish
for
two
days
and
was
now
shivering
and
in
pain
.
beside
him
sat
uvdrov
who
with
rapid
gesticulations
was
giving
him
some
in
formation
speaking
in
low
tones
as
they
all
did

on

stomach
.
on
the
other
side
sat
count
ostermanntolst6y
seemingly
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
.
his
broad
head
with
its
bold
features
and
glittering
eyes
was
resting
on
his
hand
.
ravski
twitching
forward
the
black
hair
on
his
temples
as
was
his
habit
glanced
now
at
kutuzov
and
now
at
the
door
with
a
look
of
impatience
.
konovnitsyns
firm
hand
some
and
kindly
face
was
lit
up
by
a
tender
sly
smile
.
his
glance
met
maldshas
and
the
expression
of
his
eyes
caused
the
little
girl
to
smile
.
they
were
all
waiting
for
bennigsen
who
on
the
pretext
of
inspecting
the
position
was
finishing
his
savory
dinner
.
they
waited
for
him
from
four
till
six
oclock
and
did
not
be
gin
their
deliberations
all
that
time
but
talked
in
low
tones
of
other
matters
.
only
when
bennigsen
had
entered
the
hut
did
kutuzov
leave
his
corner
and
draw
toward
the
table
but
not
near
enough
for
the
candles
that
had
been
placed
there
to
light
up
his
face
.
bennigsen
opened
the
council
with
the
ques
tion
are
we
to
abandon
russias
ancient
and
sacred
capital
without
a
struggle
or
are
we
to
defend
it
a
prolonged
and
general
silence
followed
.
there
was
a
frown
on
every
face
and
only
kutuzovs
angry
grunts
and
occasional
cough
broke
the
silence
.
all
eyes
were
gazing
at
him
.
malsha
too
looked
at
granddad
.
she
was
nearest
to
him
and
saw
how
his
face
puckered
he
seemed
about
to
cry
but
this
did
not
last
long
.
russias
ancient
and
sacred
capital
he
suddenly
said
repeating
bennigsens
words
in
an
angry
voice
and
thereby
drawing
attention
to
the
false
note
in
them
.
allow
me
to
tell
you
your
excellency
that
that
question
has
no
meaning
fora
russian
.
he
lurched
hisheavy
body
forward
.
such
a
question
cannot
be
put
it
is
senseless
the
question
i
have
asked
these
gentlemen
to
meet
to
discuss
is
a
military
one
.
the
question
is
that
of
saving
russia
.
is
it
better
to
give
up
moscow
without
a
battle
or
by
accepting
battle
to
risk
losing
the
army
as
well
as
moscow
that
is
the
question
on
which
i
want
your
opinion
and
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
.
the
discussion
began
.
bennigsen
did
not
yet
consider
his
game
lost
.
admitting
the
view
of
barclay
and
others
that
a
defensive
battle
at
fili
was
impossible
but
imbued
with
rus
sian
patriotism
and
the
love
of
moscow
he
proposed
to
move
troops
from
the
right
to
the
left
flank
during
the
night
and
attack
the
french
right
flank
the
following
day
.
opin
ions
were
divided
and
arguments
were
ad
vanced
for
and
against
that
project
.
ermolov
dokhturov
and
ravski
agreed
with
bennig

.
sen
.
whether
feeling
it
necessary
to
make
a
sacrifice
before
abandoning
the
capital
or
guided
by
other
personal
considerations
these
generals
seemed
not
to
understand
that
this
council
could
not
alter
the
inevitable
course
of
events
and
that
moscow
was
in
effect
already
abandoned
.
the
other
generals
however
un
derstood
it
and
leaving
aside
the
question
of
moscow
spoke
of
the
direction
the
army
should
take
in
its
retreat
.
matesha
who
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
what
was
going
on
before
her
under
stood
the
meaning
of
the
council
differently
.
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
only
a
personal
struggle
between
granddad
and
longcoat
as
she
termed
bennigsen
.
she
saw
that
they
grew
spiteful
when
they
spoke
to
one
another
and
in
her
heart
she
sided
with
granddad
.
in
the
midst
of
the
conversation
she
noticed

give
bennigsen
a

subtle
glance
and
then
to
her
joy
she
saw
that
grand
dad
said
something
to
longcoat
which
set
tled
him
.
bennigsen
suddenly
reddened
and
paced
angrily
up
and
down
the
room
.
what
so
affected
him
was
kutuzovs
calm
and
quiet
comment
on
the
advantage
or
disadvantage
of
bennigsens
proposal
to
move
troops
by
night
from
the
right
to
the
left
flank
to
attack
the
french
right
wing
.
gentlemen
said
kutuzov
i
cannot
ap
prove
of
the
counts
plan
.
moving
troops
in
close
proximity
to
an
enemy
is
always
danger
ous
and
military
history
supports
that
view
.
for
instance

.

.

.
kutuzov
seemed
to
reflect
searching
for
an
example
then
with
a
clear
naive
look
at
bennigsen
he
added
oh
yes
take
the
battle
of
friedland
which
i
think
the
count
well
remembers
and
which
was

.

.

.
not
fully
successful
only
because
our
troops
were
rearranged
too
near
the
enemy
.

.

.

.
there
followed
a
momentary
pause
which
seemed
very
long
to
them
all
.
the
discussion
recommenced
but
pauses
fre
quently
occurred
and
they
all
felt
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
.
during
one
of
these
pauses
kuttizov
heaved
a
deep
sigh
as
if
preparing
to
speak
.
they
all
looked
at
him
.
well
gentlemen
i
see
that
it
is
i
who
will
have
to
pay
for
the
broken
crockery
said
he
and
rising
slowly
he
moved
to
the
table
.

some
of

he
paused
by
the

after
that
the
generals
began
to
disperse
with
the
solemnity
and
circumspect
silence
of
people
who
are
leaving
after
a
funeral
.
some
of
the
generals
in
low
tones
and
in
a
strain
very
different
from
the
way
they
had
spoken
during
the
council
communicated
something
to
their
commander
in
chief
.
malasha
who
had
long
been

for

climbed
carefully
backwards
down
from

oven
her
bare
little
feet
catching
at
its
projections
and
slipping
between
the
legs
of
the

she
darted
out
of
the
room
.
when
he
had
dismissed
the
generals
kutu
zov
sat
a
long
time
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
thinking
always
of
the
same
terrible
question
when
when
did
the
abandonment
of

become
inevitable
when

chapter
v
at
that
very
time
in
circumstances
even
more
important
than
retreating
without
a
battle
namely
the
evacuation
and
burning
of
mos
cow
rostopchfn
who
is
usually
represented
as
being
the
instigator
of
that
event
acted
in
an
altogether
different
manner
from
kutiizov
.
after
the
battle
of
borodin6
the
abandon
ment
and
burning
of
moscow
was
as
inevi
table
as
the
retreat
of
the
army
beyond
moscow
without
fighting
.
every
russian
might
have
predicted
it
not
by
reasoning
but
by
the
feeling
implanted
in
each
of
us
and
in
our
fathers
.
the
same
thing
that
took
place
in
moscow
had
happened
in
all
the
towns
and
villages
on
russian
soil
beginning
with
smolensk
with
out
the
participation
of
count
rostopchfn
and
his
broadsheets
.
the
people
awaited
the
en
emy
unconcernedly
did
not
riot
or
become
ex
cited
or
tear
anyone
to
pieces
but
faced
its
fate
feeling
within
it
the
strength
to
find
what
it
should
do
at
that
most
difficult
moment
.
and
as
soon
as
the
enemy
drew
near
the
weal
thy
classes
went
away
abandoning
their
property
while
the
poorer
remained
and
burned
and
destroyed
what
was
left
.
the
consciousness
that
this
would
be
so
and
would
always
be
so
was
and
is
present
in
the
heart
of
every
russian
.
and
a
consciousness
of
this
and
a
foreboding
that
moscow
would
be
taken
was
present
in
russian
moscow
society
in
1812
.
those
who
had
quitted
moscow
al
ready
in
july
and
at
the
beginning
of
august
showed
that
they
expected
this
.
those
who
went
away
taking
what
they
could
and
aban
doning
their
houses
and
half
their
belong
ings
did
so
from
the
latent
patriotism
which
expresses
itself
not
by
phrases
or
by
giving
ones
children
to
save
the
fatherland
and
similar
unnatural
exploits
but
unobtrusively
simply
organically
and
therefore
in
the
way
that
always
produces
the
most
powerful
re
sults
.
it
is
disgraceful
to
run
away
from
danger
only
cowards
are
running
away
from
moscow
they
were
told
.
in
his
broadsheets
rostopchin
impressed
on
them
that
to
leave
moscow
was
shameful
.
they
were
ashamed
to
be
called
cowards
ashamed
to
leave
but
still
they
left
knowing
it
had
to
be
done
.
why
did
they
go
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
rostopchfn
had
scared
them
by
his
accounts
of
horrors
na
poleon
had
committed
in
conquered
countries
.
the
first
people
to
go
away
were
the
rich
edu
cated
people
who
knew
quite
well
that
vienna
and
berlin
had
remained
intact
and
that
dur
ing
napoleons
occupation
the
inhabitants
had
spent
their
time
pleasantly
in
the
com
pany
of
the
charming
frenchmen
whom
the
russians
and
especially
the
russian
ladies
then
liked
so
much
.
they
went
away
because
for
russians
there
could
be
no
question
as
to
whether
things
would
go
well
or
ill
under
french
rule
in
mos
cow
.
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
be
under
french
rule
it
would
be
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
.
they
went
away
even
before
the
battle
of
borodin6
and
still
more
rapidly
after
it
despite
rostopchins
calls
to
defend
moscow
or
the
announcement
of
his
intention
to
take
the
wonderworking
icon
of
the
iberi
an
mother
of
god
and
go
to
fight
or
of
the
balloons
that
were
to
destroy
the
french
and
despite
all
the
nonsense
rostopchfn
wrote
in
his
broadsheets
.
they
knew
that
it
was
for
the
army
to
fight
and
that
if
it
could
not
succeed
it
would
not
do
to
take
young
ladies
and
house
serfs
to
the
three
hills
quarter
of
moscow
to
fight
napoleon
and
that
they
must
go
away
sorry
as
they
were
to
abandon
their
property
476
war
and
peace
to
destruction
.
they
went
away
without
think
ing
of
the
tremendous
significance
of
that
im
mense
and
wealthy
city
being
given
over
to
destruction
for
a
great
city
with
wooden
build
ings
was
certain
when
abandoned
by
its
in
habitants
to
be
burned
.
they
went
away
each
on
his
own
account
and
yet
it
was
only
in
con
sequence
of
their
going
away
that
the
momen
tous
event
was
accomplished
that
will
always
remain
the
greatest
glory
of
the
russian
peo
ple
.
the
lady
who
afraid
of
being
stopped
by
count
rostopchins
orders
had
already
in
june
moved
with
her
negroes
and
her
women
jesters
from
moscow
to
her
saratov
estate
with
a
vague
consciousness
that
she
was
not
bona

servant
was
really
simply
and
truly
carrying
out
the
great
work
which
saved
russia

now
taunted
those
who
left
moscow
and
now
had
the
govern

offices
removed
now
distributed
quite
useless
weapons
to
the
drunken
rabble
now
had
processions
displaying
the

arid
now
forbade
father
augustin
to
remove

or
the
relics

now
seized
all

carts
in
moscow
and
on
one

of
them
removed

was
being
constructed

now
hinted
that
he
would
burn
moscow
and
related
how
he
had
set
fire
to
his
own
house
now
wrote
a
proclamation
to
the
french
solemnly
upbraid
ing
them
for
having
destroyed
his
orphanage
now
claimed
the
glory
of
having
hinted
that
he
would
burn
moscow
and
now
repudiated
the
deed
now
ordered
the
people
to
catch
all
spies
and
bring
them
to
him
and
now
re
proached
them
for
doing
so
now
expelled
all
the
french
residents
from
moscow
and
now
allowed
madame
aubertchalme
the
center
of
the
whole
french
colony
in
moscow
to
re
main

ordered
the
venerable
old
postmas

be
arrested

offense

assembled
the
people
at

handed
over
to
them
a
man
to
be
killed
and
himself
drove
away
by
a
back
gate
now
declared
that
he
would
not
survive
the
fall
of
moscow
and
now
wrote
french
verses
in
albums
concerning
his
share
in
the
affair
this
man
did
not
understand
the
mean
ing
of
what
was
happening
but
merely
wanted
to
do
something
himself
that
would
astonish
people
to
perform
some
patriotically
heroic
feat
and
like
a
child
he
made
sport
of
the
mo
mentous
and
unavoidable
event
the
abandon
ment
and
burning
of
moscow
and
tried
with
his
puny
hand
now
to
speed
and
now
to
stay
the
enormous
popular
tide
that
bore
him
along
with
it

chapter
vi
helne
having
returned
with
the
court
from
vilna
to
petersburg
found
herself
in
a
difficult
position
.
in
petersburg
she
had
enjoyed
the
special
protection
of
a
grandee
who
occupied
one
of
the
highest
posts
in
the
empire
.
in
vilna
she
had
formed
an
intimacy
with
a
young
foreign
prince
.
when
she
returned
to
petersburg
both
the
magnate
and
the
prince
were
there
and
both
claimed
their
rights
.
helene
was
faced
by
a
new
problem
how
to
preserve
her
intimacy
with
both
without
offending
either
.
what
would
have
seemed
difficult
or
even
impossible
to
another
woman
did
not
cause
the
least
embarrassment
to
countess
bezukho
va
who
evidently
deserved
her
reputation
of
being
a
very
clever
woman
.
had
she
attempted
concealment
or
tried
to
extricate
herself
from
her
awkward
position
by
cunning
she
would
have
spoiled
her
case
by
acknowledging
her
self
guilty
.
but
hellene
like
a
really
great
man
who
can
do
whatever
he
pleases
at
once
as
sumed
her
own
position
to
be
correct
as
she
sincerely
believed
it
to
be
and
that
everyone
else
was
to
blame
.
the
first
time
the
young
foreigner
allowed
hirnselt
to
reproach
her
she
lifted
her
beauti
ful
head
and
half
turning
to
him
said
firmly
thats
just
like
a
man
selfish
and
cruel
i
expected
nothing
else
.
a
woman
sacrifices
her
self
for
you
she
suffers
and
this
is
her
reward
what
right
have
you
monseigneur
to
demand
an
account
of
my
attachments
and
friendships
he
is
a
man
who
has
been
more
than
a
father
to
me
i
the
prince
was
about
to
say
some
thing
but
helene
interrupted
him
.
well
yes
said
she
it
may
be
that
he
has
other
sentiments
for
me
than
those
of
a
father
but
that
is
not
a
reason
for
me
to
shut
my
door
on
him
.
i
am
not
a
man
that
i
should
repay
kindness
with
ingratitude
know
monsei
gneur
that
in
all
that
relates
to
my
intimate
feelings
i
render
account
only
to
god
and
to
my
conscience
she
concluded
layinghcr
hand
on
her
beautiful
fully
expanded
bosom
and
looking
up
to
heaven
.
but
for
heavens
sake
listen
to
mel
marry
me
and
i
will
be
your
slavel
but
thats
impossible
.
you
wont
deign
to
demean
yourself
by
marrying
me
you

.
said
helfcne
beginning
to
cry
.
the
prince
tried
to
comfort
her
but
hlene
as
if
quite
distraught
said
through
her
tears
that
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
her
marry
ing
that
there
were
precedents
there
were
up
to
that
time
very
few
but
she
mentioned
na
poleon
and
some
other
exalted
personages
that
she
had
never
been
her
husbands
wife
and
that
she
had
been
sacrificed
.
but

the

already

.
what
have
they
been
invented
for
if
they
cant
arrange
that
said
the
prince
was
surprised
that
so
simple
an
idea
had
not
occurred
to
him
and
he
ap
plied
for
advice
to
the
holy
brethren
of
the
society
of
jesus
with
whom
he
was
on
inti
mate
terms
.
a
few
days
later
at
one
of
those
enchanting
fetes
which
hlenc
gave
at
her
country
house
on
the
stone
island
the
charming
monsieur

was
presented
to

and
in
the
garden
by
the
light
of
the
illuminations
and
to
the
sound
of
music
talked
to
her
for
a
long
time
of
the
love
of
god
of
christ
of
the
sacred
heart
and
of
the
consolations
the
one
true
catholic
religion
affords
in
this
world
and
the
next
.
htflcne
was
touched
and
more
than
once
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
and
to
those
of
monsieur
de
jobert
and
their
voices
trembled
.
a
dance
for
which
her
partner
came
to
seek
her
put
an
end
to
her
discourse
with
her
future
directeur
de
conscience
but
the
next
evening
monsieur
de
jobert
came
to
see
helene
when
she
was
alone
and
after
that
often
came
again
.
one
day
he
took
the
countess
to
a
roman
catholic
church
where
she
knelt
down
before
the
altar
to
which
she
was
led
.
the
enchant
ing
middleaged
frenchman
laid
his
hands
on
her
head
and
as
she
herself
afterward
de
scribed
it
she
felt
something
like
a
fresh
breeze
wafted
into
her
soul
.
it
was
explained
to
her
that
this
was
la
grdce
.
after
that
a
longfrocked
abb
was
brought
to
her
.
she
confessed
to
him
and
he
absolved
her
from
her
sins
.
next
day
she
received
a
box
containing
the
sacred
host
which
was
left
at
her
house
for
her
to
partake
of
.
a
few
days
later
helene
learned
with
pleasure
that
she
had
now
been
admitted
to
the
true
catholic
church
and
that
in
a
few
days
the
pope
him
self
would
hear
of
her
and
would
send
her
a
certain
document

all
that
was
done
around
her
and
to
her
at
this
time
all
the
attention
devoted
to
her
by
so
many
clever
men
and
expressed
in
such
pleasant
refined
ways
and
the
state
of
dove
like
purity
she
was
now
in
she
wore
only
white
dresses
and
white
ribbons
all
that
time
gave
her
pleasure
but
her
pleasure
did
not
cause
her
for
a
moment
to
forget
her
aim
.
and
as
it
always
happens
in
contests
of
cunning
that
a
stupid
person
gets
the
better
of
cleverer
ones
htfltne
having
realized
that
the
main
object
of
all
these
words
and
all
this
trouble
was
after
converting
her
to
catholicism
to
obtain
money
from
her
for
jesuit
institutions
as
to
which
she
received
indications
before
parting
with
her
money
insisted
that
the
vari
ous
operations
necessary
to
free
her
from
her
husband
should
be
performed
.
in
her
view
the
aim
of
every
religion
was
merely
to
preserve
certain
proprieties
while
affording
satisfaction
to
human
desires
.
and
with
this
aim
in
one
of
her
talks
with
her
father
confessor
she
in
sisted
on
an
answer
to
the
question
in
how
far
was
she
bound
by
her

they

in

the

of

wearing

transparent
over

and

a

man
with
a

a
pleasant
firm
mouth
and
white
hands
meekly
folded
on

sat
close
to

with
a
subtle
smile
on
his
lips
and
a
peaceful
look
of
delight
at
her
beauty
occasionally
glanced
at
her
face
as
he
explained
his

on

helene
with
an
uneasy
smile
looked
at
his
curly
hair
and
his
plump
cleanshaven
blackish
cheeks
and
every
moment
expected
the
conversation
to
take
a
fresh
turn

though
he
evidently
enjoyed
the
beauty
of
his
compan

was
absorbed
in
his
mastery
of
the

.
the
course
of
the

ran
as
follows
ignorant
of
the
import
of
what
you
were
undertaking
you
made
a
vow
of
conjugal
fidelity
to
a
man
who
on
his
part
by
entering
the
married
state
without
faith
in
the
religious
significance
of
marriage
committed
an
act
of
sacrilege
.
that
marriage
lacked
the
dual
significance
it
should
have
had
.
yet
in
spite
of
this
your
vow
was
binding

you
swerved
from

what

so
acting

a

if

with

of

smiles

the
director
of
her
conscience
was
astounded
at
having
the
case
presented
to
him
thus
with
the
simplicity
of
columbus
egg
.
he
was
de
lighted
at
the
unexpected
rapidity
of
his
pu
pils
progress
but
could
not
abandon
the
edi
fice
of
argument
he
had
laboriously
constructed
.
let
us
understand
one
another
countess
said
he
with
a
smile
and
began
refuting
his
spiritual
daughters
arguments
.
chapter
vii
helene
understood
that
the
question
was
very
simple
and
easy
from
the
ecclesiastical
point
of
view
and
that
her
directors
were
making
difficulties
only
because
they
were
apprehen
sive
as
to
how
the
matter
would
be
regarded
by
the
secular
authorities
.
so
she
decided
that
it
was
necessary
to
pre
pare
the
opinion
of
society
.
she
provoked
the
jealousy
of
the
elderly
magnate
and
told
him
what
she
had
told
her
other
suitor
that
is
she
put
the
matter
so
that
the
only
way
for
him
to
obtain
a
right
over
her
was
to
marry
her
.
the
elderly
magnate
was
at
first
as
much
taken
aback
by
this
suggestion
of
marriage
with
a
woman
whose
husband
was
alive
as
the
young
er
man
had
been
but
helenes
imperturbable
conviction
that
it
was
as
simple
and
natural
as
marrying
a
maiden
had
its
effect
on
him
too
.
had
hellene
herself
shown
the
least
sign
of
hesitation
shame
or
secrecy
her
cause
would
certainly
have
been
lost
but
not
only
did
she
show
no
signs
of
secrecy
or
shame
on
the
con
trary
with
goodnatured
naivete
she
told
her
intimate
friends
and
these
were
all
peters
burg
that
both
the
prince
and
the
magnate
had
proposed
to
her
and
that
she
loved
both
and
was
afraid
of
grieving
either
.
a
rumor
immediately
spread
in
petersburg
not
that
helene
wanted
to
be
divorced
from
her
husband
had
such
a
report
spread
many
would
have
opposed
so
illegal
an
intention
but
simply
that
the
unfortunate
and
interest
ing
hellene
was
in
doubt
which
of
the
two
men
she
should
marry
.
the
question
was
no
longer
whether
this
was
possible
but
only
which
was
the
better
match
and
how
the
mat
ter
would
be
regarded
at
court
.
there
were
it
is
true
some
rigid
individuals
unable
to
rise
to
the
height
of
such
a
question
who
saw
in
the
project
a
desecration
of
the
sacrament
of
mar
war
and
peace
riage
but
there
were
not
many
such
and
they
remained
silent
while
the
majority
were
inter
ested
in
hellenes
good
fortune
and
in
the
question
which
match
would
be
the
more
ad
vantageous
.
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong
to
remarry
while
one
had
a
husband
living
they
did
not
discuss
for
that
question
had
evi
dently
been
settled
by
people
wiser
than
you
or
me
as
they
said
and
to
doubt
the
correct
ness
of
that
decision
would
be
to
risk
exposing
ones
stupidity
and
incapacity
to
live
in
society
.
only
marya
dmitrievna
akhrosimova
who
had
come
to
petersburg
that
summer
to
see
one
of
her
sons
allowed
herself
plainly
to
ex
press
an
opinion
contrary
to
the
general
one

meeting
hellene
at
a
ball
she
stopped
her
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
amid
general
si
lence
said
in
her
gruff
voice
so

in

as

in

this
letter
was
brought
to

house
when
he
was
on
the
field
of

toward
the
end
of
the
battle
of
borodin6
pierre
having
run
down
from
raevskis
bat
tery
a
second
time
made
his
way
through
a
gully
to
knyazk6vo
with
a
crowd
of
soldiers
reached
the
dressing
station
and
seeing
blood
and
hearing
cries
and
groans
hurried
on
still
entangled
in
the
crowds
of
soldiers
.
the
one
thing
he
now
desired
with
his
whole
soul
was
to
get
away
quickly
from
the
terrible
sensations
amid
which
he
had
lived
that
day
and
return
to
ordinary
conditions
of
life
and
sleep
quietly
in
a
room
in
his
own
bed
.
he
felt
that
only
in
the
ordinary
conditions
of
life
would
he
be
able
to
understand
himself
and
all
he
had
seen
and
felt
.
but
such
ordinary
conditions
of
life
were
nowhere
to
be
found
.
though
shells
and
bullets
did
not
whistle
over
the
road
along
which
he
was
going
still
on
all
sides
there
was
what
there
had
been
on
the
field
of
battle
.
there
were
still
the
same
suffering
exhausted
and
sometimes
strangely
indifferent
faces
the
same
blood
the
same
sol
diers
overcoats
the
same
sounds
of
firing
which
though
distant
now
still
aroused
terror
and
besides
this
there
were
the
foul
air
and
the
dust
.
having
gone
a
couple
of
miles
along
the
mozhaysk
road
pierre
sat
down
by
the
road
side
.
dusk
had
fallen
and
the
roar
of
guns
died
away
.
pierre
lay
leaning
on
his
elbow
for
a
long
time
gazing
at
the
shadows
that
moved
past
him
in
the
darkness
.
he
was
continually
imag
ining
that
a
cannon
ball
was
flying
toward
him
with
a
terrific
whizz
and
then
he
shuddered
and
sat
up
.
he
had
no
idea
how
long
he
had
been
there
.
in
the
middle
of
the
night
three
soldiers
having
brought
some
firewood
set
tled
down
near
him
and
began
lighting
a
fire
.
the
soldiers
who
threw
sidelong
glances
at
pierre
got
the
fire
to
burn
and
placed
an
iron
pot
on
it
into
which
they
broke
some
dried
bread
and
put
a
little
dripping
.
the
pleasant
odor
of
greasy
viands
mingled
with
the
smell
of
smoke
.
pierre
sat
up
and
sighed
.
the
three
soldiers
were
eating
and
talking
among
them
selves
taking
no
notice
of
him
.
and
who
may
you
be
one
of
them
sud
denly
asked
pierre
evidently
meaning
what
pierre
himself
had
in
mind
namely
if
you
want
to
eat
well
give
you
some
food
only
let
us
know
whether
you
are
an
honest
man

said
pierre
feeling
it
necessary
to
minimize
his
social
position
as
much
as
possi
ble
so
as
to
be
nearer
to
the
soldiers
and
better
understood
by
them
.
by
rights
i
am
a
militia
officer
but
my
men
are
not
here
.
i
came
to
the
battle
and
have
lost
them
.
there
now
said
one
of
the
soldiers
.
another
shook
his
head
.
would
you
like
a
little
mash
the
first
sol
dier
asked
and
handed
pierre
a
wooden
spoon
after
licking
it
clean
.
pierre
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
began
eating
the
mash
as
they
called
the
food
in
the
caul
dron
and
he
thought
it
more
delicious
than
any
food
he
had
ever
tasted
.
as
he
sat
bending
greedily
over
it
helping
himself
to
large
spoon
fuls
and
chewing
one
after
another
his
face
was
lit
up
by
the
fire
and
the
soldiers
looked
at
him
in
silence
.
where
have
you
to
go
to
tell

one
of
them

well

peter
kirilych
come
along
with
us
well

there
.
in
the
total
darkness
the
soldiers
walked
with
pierre
to
mozhdysk
.
by
the
time
they
got
near
mozhdysk
and
be
gan
ascending
the
steep
hill
into
the
town
the
cocks
were
already
crowing
.
pierre
went
on
with
the
soldiers
quite
forgetting
that
his
inn
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
that
he
had
already
passed
it
.
he
would
not
soon
have
re
membered
this
such
was
his
state
of
forgetful
ness
had
he
not
halfway
up
the
hill
stumbled
upon
his
groom
who
had
been
to
look
for
him
in
the
town
and
was
returning
to
the
inn
.
the
groom
recognized
pierre
in
the
darkness
by
his
white
hat
.
your
excellency
he
said
.
why
we
were
beginning
to
despair
how
is
it
you
are
on
foot
and
where
are
you
going
please
oh
yes
said
pierre
.
the
soldiers
stopped
.
so
youve
found
your
folk
said
one
of
them
.
well
goodby
peter
kirilychisnt
it
goodby
peter
kirilychl
pierre
heard
the
other
voices
repeat
.
goodby
he
said
and
turned
with
his
groom
toward
the
inn
.
i
ought
to
give
them
something
he
thought
and
felt
in
his
pocket
.
no
better
notl
said
another
inner
voice
.
book

there
was
not
a
room
to
be
had
at
the
inn
they
were
all
occupied
.
pierre
went
out
into
the
yard
and
covering
himself
up
head
and
all
lay
down
in
his
carriage
.
chapter
ix
scarcely
had
pierre
laid
his
head
on
the
pil
low
before
he
felt
himself
falling
asleep
but
suddenly
almost
with
the
distinctness
of
re
ality
he
heard
the
boom
boom
boom
of
fir
ing
the
thud
of
projectiles
groans
and
cries
and
smelled
blood
and
powder
and
a
feeling
of
horror
and
dread
of
death
seized
him
.
filled
with
fright
he
opened
his
eyes
and
lifted
his
head
from
under
his
cloak
.
all
was
tranquil
in
the
yard
.
only
someones
orderly
passed
through
the
gateway
splashing
through
the
mud
and
talked
to
the
innkeeper
.
above
pierres
head
some
pigeons
disturbed
by
the
movement
he
had
made
in
sitting
up
fluttered
under
the
dark
roof
of
the
penthouse
.
the
whole
courtyard
was
permeated
by
a
strong
peaceful
smell
of
stable
yards
delightful
to
pierre
at
that
moment
.
he
could
see
the
clear
starry
sky
between
the
dark
roofs
of
two
pent
houses
.
thank
god
there
is
no
more
of
that
he
thought
covering
up
his
head
again
.
oh
what
a
terrible
thing
is
fear
and
how
shame
fully
i
yielded
to
it
but
they

.

.

.
they
were
steady
and
calm
all
the
time
to
the
end

.

.

.
thought
he
.
they
in
pierres
mind
were
the
soldiers
those
who
had
been
at
the
battery
those
who
had
given
him
food
and
those
who
had
prayed
before
the
icon
.
they
those
strange
men
he
had
not
previously
known
stood
out
clearly
and
sharply
from
everyone
else
.
to
be
a
soldier
just
a
soldier
thought
pierre
as
he
fell
asleep
to
enter
communal
life
completely
to
be
imbued
by
what
makes
them
what
they
are
.
but
how
cast
off
all
the
superfluous
devilish
burden
of
my
outer
man
there
was
a
time
when
i
could
have
done
it
.
i
could
have
run
away
from
my
father
as
i
wanted
to
.
or
1
might
have
been
sent
to
serve
as
a
soldier
after
the
duel
with
d61okhov
.
and
the
memory
of
the
dinner
at
the
english
club
when
he
hacl
challenged
dolokhov
flashed
through
pierres
mind
and
then
he
remem
bered
his
benefactor
at
torzhok
.
and
now
a
picture
of
a
solemn
meeting
of
the
lodge
pre
sented
itself
to
his
mind
.
it
was
taking
place
at
the
english
club
and
someone
near
and
dear
to
him
sat
at
the
end
of
the
table
.
yes
that
is
hel
it
is
my
benefactor
.
but
he
died
thought
pierre
.
yes
he
died
and
i
did
not
know
he
was
alive
.
how
sorry
i
am
that
he
died
and
how
glad
i
am
that
he
is
alive
again
on
one
side
of
the
table
sat
anatole
dolokhov
nes
vftski
denisov
and
others
like
them
in
his
dream
the
category
to
which
these
men
be
longed
was
as
clearly
defined
in
his
mind
as
the
category
of
those
he
termed
they
and
he
heard
those
people
anatole
and
dolokhov
shouting
and
singing
loudly
yet
through
their
shouting
the
voice
of
his
benefactor
was
heard
speaking
all
the
time
and
the
sound
of
his
words
was
as
weighty
and
uninterrupted
as
the
booming
on
the
battlefield
but
pleasant
and
comforting
.
pierre
did
not
understand
what
his
benefactor
was
saying
but
he
knew
the
categories
of
thoughts
were
also
quite
distinct
in
his
dream
that
he
was
talking
of
goodness
and
the
possibility
of
being
what
they
were
.
and
they
with
their
simple
kind
firm
faces
surrounded
his
benefactor
on
all
sides
.
but
though
they
were
kindly
they
did
not
look
at
pierre
and
did
not
know
him
.
wishing
to
speak
and
to
attract
their
attention
he
got
up
but
at
that
moment
his
legs
grew
cold
and
bare
.
he
felt
ashamed
and
with
one
arm
covered
his
legs
from
whichhiscloakhad
in
factslipped
.
for
a
moment
as
he
was
rearranging
his
cloak
pierre
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
the
same
pent
house
roofs
posts
and
yard
but
now
they
were
all
bluish
lit
up
and
glittering
with
frost
or
dew
.
it
is
dawn
thought
pierre
.
but
thats
not
what
i
want
.
i
want
to
hear
and
understand
my
benefactors
words
.
again
he
covered
him
self
up
with
his
cloak
but
now
neither
the
lodge
nor
his
benefactor
was
there
.
there
were
only
thoughts
clearly
expressed
in
words
thoughts
that
someone
was
uttering
or
that
he
himself
was
formulating
.
afterwards
when
he
recalled
those
thought
pierre
was
convinced
that
someone
outside
himself
had
spoken
them
though
the
impres
sions
of
that
day
had
evoked
them
.
he
had
never
it
seemed
to
him
been
able
to
think
and
express
his
thoughts
like
that
when
awake
to
endure
war
is
the
most
difficult
subor
d
ination
of
mans
freedom
to
the
law
of
god
the
voice
had
said
.
simplicity
is
submission
tc
the
will
of
god
you
cannot
escape
from
him
and
they
are
simple
.
they
do
not
talk
but
act
the
spoken
word
is
silver
but
the
unspoken
ii
golden
.
man
can
be
master
of
nothing
whil
he
fears
death
but
he
who
does
not
fear
it
pos
sesses
all
.
if
there
were
no
suffering
man
woulc
war
and
peace
not
know
his
limitations
would
not
know
himself
.
the
hardest
thing
pierre
went
on
thinking
or
hearing
in
his
dream
is
to
be
able
in
your
soul
to
unite
the
meaning
of
all
.
to
unite
all
he
asked
himself
.
no
not
to
unite
.
thoughts
cannot
be
united
but
to
har
ness
all
these
thoughts
together
is
what
we
need
yes
one
must
harness
them
must
har
ness
them
he
repeated
to
himself
with
in
ward
rapture
feeling
that
these
words
and
they
alone
expressed
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
solved
the
question
that
tormented
him
.
yes
one
must
harness
it
is
time
to
harness
.
time
to
harness
time
to
harness
your
ex
cellency
your
excellency
some
voice
was
re
peating
.
we
must
harness
it
is
time
to
har
ness
.

.

.

.
it
was
the
voice
of
the
groom
trying
to
wake
him
.
the
sun
shone
straight
into
pierres
face
.
he
glanced
at
the
dirty
innyard
in
the
middle
of
which
soldiers
were
watering
their
lean
horses
at
the
pump
while
carts
were
passing
out
of
the
gate
.
pierre
turned
away
with
re
pugnance
and
closing
his
eyes
quickly
fell
back
on
the
carriage
seat
.
no
i
dont
want
that
i
dont
want
to
see
and
understand
that
.
i
want
to
understand
what
was
revealing
itself
to
me
in
my
dream
.
one
second
more
and
i
should
have
understood
it
all
but
what
am
1
to
do
harness
but
how
can
i
harness
every
thing
and
pierre
felt
with
horror
that
the
meaning
of
all
he
had
seen
and
thought
in
the
dream
had
been
destroyed
.
the
groom
the
coachman
and
the
innkeep
er
told
pierre
that
an
officer
had
come
with
news
that
the
french
were
already
near
moz
hiysk
and
that
our
men
were
leaving
it
.
pierre
got
up
and
having
told
them
to
har
ness
and
overtake
him
went
on
foot
through
the
town
.
the
troops
were
moving
on
leaving
about
ten
thousand
wounded
behind
them
.
there
were
wounded
in
the
yards
at
the
windows
of
the
houses
and
the
streets
were
crowded
with
them
.
in
the
streets
around
carts
that
were
to
take
some
of
the
wounded
away
shouts
curses
and
blows
could
be
heard
.
pierre
offered
the
use
of
his
carriage
which
had
overtaken
him
to
a
wounded
general
he
knew
and
drove
with
him
to
moscow
.
on
the
way
pierre
was
told
of
the
death
of
his
brotherinlaw
anatole
and
of
that
of
prince
andrew
.
chapter
x
on
the
thirtieth
of
august
pierre
reached
moscow
.
close
to
the
gates
of
the
city
he
was
met
by
count
rostopchfns
adjutant
.
we
have
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
said
the
adjutant
.
the
count
wants
to
see
you
particularly
.
he
asks
you
to
come
to
him
at
once
on
a
very
important
matter
.
without
going
home
pierre
took
a
cab
and
drove
to
see
the
moscow
commander
in
chief
.
count
rostopchfn
had
only
that
morning
returned
to
town
from
his
summer
villa
at
so
k61niki
.
the
anteroom
and
reception
room
of
his
house
were
full
of
officials
who
had
been
summoned
or
had
come
for
orders
.
vasflchi
kov
and
pldtov
had
already
seen
the
count
and
explained
to
him
that
it
was
impossible
to
de
fend
moscow
and
that
it
would
have
to
be
sur
rendered
.
though
this
news
was
being
con
cealed
from
the
inhabitants
the
officialsthe
heads
of
the
various
government
departments
knew
that
moscow
would
soon
be
in
the
en
emys
hands
just
as
count
rostopchin
himself
knew
it
and
to
escape
personal
responsibility
they
had
all
come
to
the
governor
to
ask
how
they
were
to
deal
with
their
various
depart
ments
.
as
pierre
was
entering
the
reception
room
a
courier
from
the
army
came
out
of
rostop
chins
private
room
.
in
answer
to
questions
with
which
he
was
greeted
the
courier
made
a
despairing
gesture
with
his
hand
and
passed
through
the
room
.
while
waiting
in
the
reception
room
pierre
with
weary
eyes
watched
the
various
officials
old
and
young
military
and
civilian
who
were
there
.
they
all
seemed
dissatisfied
and
uneasy
.
pierre
went
up
to
a
group
of
men
one
of
whom
he
knew
.
after
greeting
pierre
they
con
tinued
their
conversation
.
if
theyre
sent
out
and
brought
back
again
later
on
it
will
do
no
harm
but
as
things
are
now
one
cant
answer
for
anything
.
but
you
see
what
he
writes

.

.

.
said
an
other
pointing
to
a
printed
sheet
he
held
in
his
hand
.
thats
another
matter
.
thats
necessary
for
the
people
said
the
first
.
what
is
it
asked
pierre
.
oh
its
a
fresh
broadsheet
.
pierre
took
it
and
began
reading
.
his
serene
highness
has
passed
through
moz
hiysk
in
order
to
join
up
with
the
troops
moving
toward
him
and
has
taken
up
a
strong
position
where
the
enemy
will
not
soon
attack
him
.
forty
eight
guns
with
ammunition
have
been
sent
him
from
here
and
his
serene
highness
says
he
will
defend
moscow
to
the
last
drop
of
blood
and
is
even
ready
to
fight
in
the
streets
.
do
not
be
upset
brothers
that
the
law
courts
are
closed
things
have
to
be
put
in
order
and
we
will
deal
with
vil
lains
in
our
own
way
when
the
time
comes
i
shall
want
both
town
and
peasant
lads
and
will
raise
the
cry
a
day
or
two
beforehand
but
they
are
not
wanted
yet
so
i
hold
my
peace
.
an
ax
will
be
use
ful
a
hunting
spear
not
bad
but
a
threepronged
fork
will
be
best
of
all
a
frenchman
is
no
heavier
than
a
sheaf
of
rye
.
tomorrow
after
dinner
i
shall
take
the
iberian
icon
of
the
mother
of
god
to
the
wounded
in
the
catherine
hospital
where
we
will
have
some
water
blessed
.
that
will
help
them
to
get
well
quicker
.
i
too
am
well
now
one
of
my
eyes
was
sore
but
now
i
am
on
the
lookout
with
both
.
but
military
men
have
told
me
that
it
is
impossible
to
fight
in
the
town
said
pierre
and
that
the
position

.

.

.
well
of
course
thats
what
we
were
say
ing
replied
the
first
speaker
.
and
what
does
he
mean
by
one
of
my
eyes
was
sore
but
now
i
am
on
the
lookout
with
both
asked
pierre
.
the
count
had
a
sty
replied
the
adjutant
smiling
and
was
very
much
upset
when
i
told
him
people
had
come
to
ask
what
was
the
mat
ter
with
him
.
by
the
by
count
he
added
suddenly
addressing
pierre
with
a
smile
we
heard
that
you
have
family
troubles
and
that
the
countess
your
wife

.

.

.
i
have
heard
nothing
pierre
replied
un
concernedly
.
but
what
have
you
heard
oh
well
you
know
people
often
invent
things
.
i
only
say
what
i
heard
.
but
what
did
you
hear
well
they
say
continued
the
adjutant
with
the
same
smile
that
the
countess
your
wife
is
preparing
to
go
abroad
.
i
expect
its
nonsense
.

.

.

.
possibly
remarked
pierre
looking
about
him
absentmindedly
.
and
who
is
that
he
asked
indicating
a
short
old
man
in
a
clean
blue
peasant
overcoat
with
a
big
snowwhite
beard
and
eyebrows
and
a
ruddy
face
.
he
thats
a
tradesman
that
is
to
say
hes
the
restaurant
keeper
vereshchdgin
.
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
that
affair
with
the
procla
mation
.
oh
so
that
is
vereshchgin
said
pierre
looking
at
the
firm
calm
face
of
the
old
man
and
seeking
any
indication
of
his
being
a
traitor
.
thats
not
he
himself
thats
the
father
of
the
fellow
who
wrote
the
proclamation
said
the
adjutant
.
the
young
man
is
in
prison
and
i
expect
it
will
go
hard
with
him
.
an
old
gentleman
wearing
a
star
and
anoth
book
eleven
483
er
official
a
german
wearing
a
cross
round
his
neck
approached
the
speaker
.
its
a
complicated
story
you
know
said
the
adjutant
.
that
proclamation
appeared
about
two
months
ago
.
the
count
was
in
formed
of
it
.
he
gave
orders
to
investigate
the
matter
.
gabriel
ivdnovich
here
made
the
in
quiries
.
the
proclamation
had
passed
through
exactly
sixtythree
hands
.
he
asked
one
from
whom
did
you
get
it
from
soandso
.
he
went
to
the
next
one
.
from
whom
did
you
get
it
and
so
on
till
he
reached
vereshchgin
a
half
educated
tradesman
you
know
4
a
pet
of
a
trader

said
the
adjutant
smiling
.
they
asked
him
who
gave
it
you
and
the
point
is
that
we
knew
whom
he
had
it
from
.
he
could
only
have
had
it
from
the
postmaster
.
but
evi
dently
they
had
come
to
some
understanding
.
he
replied
from
no
one
i
made
it
up
my
self
.
they
threatened
and
questioned
him
but
he
stuck
to
that
i
made
it
up
myself
.
and
so
it
was
reported
to
the
count
who
sent
for
the
man
.
from
whom
did
you
get
the
procla
mation
i
wrote
it
myself
.
well
you
know
the
count
said
the
adjutant
cheerfully
with
a
smile
of
pride
he
flared
up
dreadfullyand
just
think
of
the
fellows
audacity
lying
and
obstinacy
and
the
count
wanted
him
to
say
it
was
from
klyucharev
i
understand
said
pierre
.
not
at
all
rejoined
the
adjutant
in
dis
may
.
klyucharev
had
his
own
sins
to
answer
for
without
that
and
that
is
why
he
has
been
banished
.
but
the
point
is
that
the
count
was
much
annoyed
.
how
could
you
have
written
it
yourself
said
he
arid
he
took
up
the
ham
burg
gazette
that
was
lying
on
the
table
.
here
it
is
you
did
not
write
it
yourself
but
translated
it
and
translated
it
abominably
be
cause
you
dont
even
know
french
you
fool
.
and
what
do
you
think
no
said
he
i
have
not
read
any
papers
i
made
it
up
myself
.
if
thats
so
youre
a
traitor
and
ill
have
you
tried
and
youll
be
hanged
say
from
whom
you
had
it
.
i
have
seen
no
papers
i
made
it
up
myself
.
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
.
the
count
had
the
father
fetched
but
the
fellow
stuck
to
it
.
he
was
sent
for
trial
and
con
demned
to
hard
labor
i
believe
.
now
the
fa
ther
has
come
to
intercede
for
him
.
but
hes
a
goodfornothing
lad
you
know
that
sort
of
tradesmans
son
a
dandy
and
ladykiller
.
he
attended
some
lectures
somewhere
and
imag
ines
that
the
devil
is
no
match
for
him
.
thats
the
sort
of
fellow
he
is
.
his
father
keeps
a
cook
shop
here
by
the
stone
bridge
and
you
know
war
and
peace
there
was
a
large
icon
of
god
almighty
painted
with
a
scepter
in
one
hand
and
an
orb
in
the
other
.
well
he
took
that
icon
home
with
him
for
a
few
days
and
what
did
he
do
he
found
some
scoundrel
of
a
painter

.

.
chapter
xi
in
the
middle
of
this
fresh
talc
pierre
was
summoned
to
the
commander
in
chief
.
when
he
entered
the
private
room
count
rostopchin
puckering
his
face
was
rubbing
his
forehead
and
eyes
with
his
hand
.
a
short
man
was
saying
something
but
when
pierre
entered
he
stopped
speaking
and
went
out
.
ah
how
do
you
do
great
warrior
said
rostopchin
as
soon
as
the
short
man
had
left
the
room
.
we
have
heard
of
your
prowess
.
but
thats
not
the
point
.
between
ourselves
mon
cher
do
you
belong
to
the
masons
he
went
on
severely
as
though
there
were
some
thing
wrong
about
it
which
he
nevertheless
intended
to
pardon
.
pierre
remained
silent
.
i
am
well
informed
my
friend
but
i
am
aware
that
there
are
masons
and
masons
and
i
hope
that
you
are
not
one
of
those
who
on
pretense
of
saving
mankind
wish
to
ruin
russia
.
yes
i
am
a
mason
pierre
replied
.
there
you
see
mon
cher
i
expect
you
know
that
messrs
.
spcranski
and
magnitski
have
been
deported
to
their
proper
place
.
mr
.
klyucharev
has
been
treated
in
the
same
way
and
so
have
others
who
on
the
plea
of
building
up
the
temple
of
solomon
have
tried
to
de
stroy
the
temple
of
their
fatherland
.
you
can
understand
that
there
are
reasons
for
this
and
that
i
could
not
have
exiled
the
postmaster
had
he
not
been
a
harmful
person
.
it
has
now
come
to
my
knowledge
that
you
lent
him
your
carriage
for
his
removal
from
town
and
that
you
have
even
accepted
papers
from
him
for
safe
custody
.
i
like
you
and
dont
wish
you
any
harm
and
as
you
are
only
half
my
age
i
ad
vise
you
as
a
father
would
to
cease
all
com
munication
with
men
of
that
stamp
and
to
leave
here
as
soon
as
possible
.
but
what
did
klyucharevdo
wrong
count
asked
pierre
.
that
is
for
me
to
know
but
not
for
you
to
ask
shouted
rostopchfn
.
if
he
is
accused
of
circulating
napoleons
proclamation
it
is
not
proved
that
he
did
so
said
pierre
without
looking
at
rostopchfn
and
vereshchdgin

..
.
there
we
are
rostopchin
shouted
at
pierre
louder
than
before
frowning
suddenly
.
vereshchgin
is
a
renegade
and
a
traitor
who
will
be
punished
as
he
deserves
said
he
with
the
vindictive
heat
with
which
people
speak
when
recalling
an
insult
.
but
i
did
not
sum
mon
you
to
discuss
my
actions
but
to
give
you
advice
or
an
order
if
you
prefer
it
.
i
beg
you
to
leave
the
town
and
break
off
all
communica
tion
with
such
men
as
klyucharev
.
and
i
will
knock
the
nonsense
outof
anybody
but
prob
ably
rcaliing
that
he
was
shouting
at
beziik
hov
who
so
far
was
not
guilty
of
anything
he
added
taking
pierres
hand
in
a
friendly
man
ner
we
arc
on
the
eve
of
a
public
disaster
and
i
havent
time
to
be
polite
to
everybody
who
has
business
with
me
.
my
head
is
some
times
in
a
whirl
.
well
mon
cher
what
are
you
doing
personally
why
nothing
answered
pierre
without
raising
his
eyes
or
changing
the
thoughtful
ex
pression
of
his
face
.
the
count
frowned
.
a
word
of
friendly
advice
mon
cher
.
be
off
as
soon
as
you
can
thats
all
i
have
to
tell
you
.
happy
he
who
has
ears
to
hear
.
goodby
my
dear
fellow
.
oh
by
the
by
he
shouted
through
the
doorway
after
pierre
is
it
true
that
the
countess
has
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
the
holy
fathers
of
the
society
of
jesus
pierre
did
not
answer
and
left
rostopchfns
room
more
sullen
and
angry
than
he
had
ever
before
shown
himself
.
when
he
reached
home
it
was
already
get
ting
dark
.
some
eight
people
had
come
to
see
him
that
evening
thesecretary
of
a
committee
the
colonel
of
his
battalion
his
steward
his
majordomo
and
various
petitioners
.
they
all
had
business
with
pierre
and
wanted
decisions
from
him
.
pierre
did
not
understand
and
was
not
interested
in
any
of
these
questions
and
only
answered
them
in
order
to
get
rid
of
these
people
.
when
left
alone
at
last
he
opened
and
read
his
wifes
letter
.

.
and
going
to
his
bed
he
threw
himself
on
it
without
undressing
and
immediately
fell
asleep
.
when
he
awoke
next
morning
the
major
domo
came
to
inform
him
that
a
special
mes
senger
a
police
officer
had
come
from
count
rostopchin
to
know
whether
count
beziikhov
had
left
or
was
leaving
the
town
.
a
dozen
persons
who
had
business
with
pierre
were
awaiting
him
in
the
drawing
room
.

pierre
dressed
hurriedly
and
instead
of
going
to
see
them
went
to
the
back
porch
and
out
through
the
gate
.
from
that
time
till
the
end
of
the
destruc
tion
of
moscow
no
one
of
beziikhovs
house

despite
all
the
search
they
made

again
or
knew
where
he
was
.
chapter
xii
the
rosi6vs
remained
in
moscow
till
the
first
of
september
that
is
till
the
eve
of
the
en
emys
entry
into
the
city
.
after
pkya
had
joined
oboldnskis
regi
ment
of
cossacks
and
left
for
belaya
tserkov
where
that
regiment
was
forming
the
countess
was
seized
with
terror
.
the
thought
that
both
her
sons
were
at
the
war
had
both
gone
from
under
her
wing
that
today
or
tomorrow
either
or
both
of
them
might
be
killed
like
the
three
sons
of
one
of
her
acquaintances
struck
her
that
summer
for
the
first
time
with
cruel
clear
ness
.
she
tried
to
get
nicholas
back
and
wished
to
go
herself
to
join
pkya
or
to
get
him
an
ap
pointment
somewhere
in
petersburg
but
nei
ther
of
these
proved
possible
.
ptya
could
not
return
unless
his
regiment
did
so
or
unless
he
was
transferred
to
another
regiment
on
active
service
.
nicholas
was
somewhere
with
the
army
and
had
not
sent
a
word
since
his
last
letter
in
which
he
had
given
a
detailed
account
of
his
meeting
with
princess
mary
.
the
countess
did
not
sleep
at
night
or
when
she
did
fall
asleep
dreamed
that
she
saw
her
sons
lying
dead
.
aft
er
many
consultations
and
conversations
the
count
at
last
devised
means
to
tranquillize
her
.
he
got
ptya
transferred
from
obolenskis
regi
ment
to
beziikhovs
which
was
in
training
near
moscow
.
though
pdtya
would
remain
in
the
service
this
transfer
would
give
the
coun
tess
the
consolation
of
seeing
at
least
one
of
her
sons
under
her
wing
and
she
hoped
to
ar
range
matters
for
her
phya
so
as
not
to
let
him
go
again
but
always
get
him
appointed
to
places
where
he
could
not
possibly
take
part
in
a
battle
.
as
long
as
nicholas
alone
was
in
danger
the
countess
imagined
that
she
loved
her
firstborn
more
than
all
her
other
children
and
even
reproached
herself
for
it
but
when
her
youngest
the
scapegrace
who
had
been
bad
at
lessons
was
always
breaking
things
in
the
house
and
making
himself
a
nuisance
to
everybody
that
snubnosed
ptya
with
his
merry
black
eyes
and
fresh
rosy
cheeks
where
soft
down
was
just
beginning
to
show
when
he
was
thrown
amid
those
big
dreadful
cruel
men
who
were
fighting
somewhere
about
some
thing
and
apparently
finding
pleasure
in
it
then
his
mother
thought
she
loved
him
more
much
more
than
all
her
other
children
.
the
nearer
the
time
came
for
ptya
to
return
the
more
uneasy
grew
the
countess
.
she
began
to
think
she
would
never
live
to
see
such
happi
ness
.
the
presence
of
sonya
of
her
beloved
natasha
or
even
of
her
husband
irritated
her
.
what
do
i
want
with
them
i
want
no
one
but
p6tya
she
thought
.
at
the
end
of
august
the
rost6vs
received
another
letter
from
nicholas
.
he
wrote
from
the
province
ot
vor6nezh
where
he
had
been
sent
to
procure
remounts
but
that
letter
did
riot
set
the
countess
at
ease
.
knowing
that
one
son
was
out
of
danger
she
became
the
more
anxious
about
ptya
.
though
by
the
twentieth
of
august
nearly
all
the
rostovs
acquaintances
had
left
mos
cow
and
though
everybody
tried
to
persuade
the
countess
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible

.she
would
not
hear
of
leaving
before
her
treas
ure
her
adored
petya
returned
.
on
the
twenty
eighth
of
august
he
arrived
.
the
passionate
tenderness
with
which
his
mother
received
him
did
not
please
the
sixteenyearold
officer
.
though
she
concealed
from
him
her
intention
of
keeping
him
under
her
wing
petya
guessed
her
designs
and
instinctively
fearing
that
he
might
give
way
to
emotion
when
with
her
might
become
womanish
as
he
termed
it
to
himselfhe
treated
her
coldly
avoided
her
and
during
his
stay
in
moscow
attached
him
self
exclusively
to
natasha
for
whom
he
had
al
ways
had
a
particularly
brotherly
tenderness
almost
loverlike
.
owing
to
the
counts
customary
carelessness
nothing
was
ready
for
their
departure
by
the
twentyeighth
of
august
and
the
carts
that
were
to
come
from
their
ryazdn
and
moscow
estates
to
remove
their
household
belongings
did
not
arrive
till
the
thirtieth
.
from
the
twentyeighth
till
the
thirty
first
all
moscow
was
in
a
bustle
and
commotion
.
every
day
thousands
of
men
wounded
at
boro
din6
were
brought
in
by
the
dorogomilov
gate
and
taken
to
various
parts
of
moscow
and
thousands
of
carts
conveyed
the
inhabitants
and
their
possessions
out
by
the
other
gates
.
in
spite
of
rostopchfns
broadsheets
or
be
cause
of
them
or
independently
of
them
the
strangest
and
most
contradictory
rumors
were
current
in
the
town
.
some
said
that
no
one
was
to
be
allowed
to
leave
the
city
others
on
the
contrary
said
that
all
the
icons
had
been
taken
out
of
the
churches
and
everybody
was
to
be
486
war
and
ordered
to
leave
.
some
said
there
had
been
an
other
battle
after
borodino
at
which
the
french
had
been
routed
while
others
on
the
contrary
reported
that
the
russian
army
had
been
de
stroyed
.
some
talked
about
the
moscow
militia
which
preceded
by
the
clergy
would
go
to
the
three
hills
others
whispered
that
augustin

had
been
forbidden
to
leave
that
traitors
had
been
seized
that
the
peasants
were
rioting
and
robbing
people
on
their
way
from
moscow
and
so
on
.
but
all
this
was
only
talk
in
reality
though
the
council
of
filf
at
which
it
was
decided
to
abandon
moscow
had
not
yet
been
held
both
those
who
went
away
and
those
who
remained
behind
felt
though
they
did
not
show
it
that
moscow
would
certainly
be
aban
doned
and
that
they
ought
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
and
save
their
belongings
.
it
was
felt
that
everything
would
suddenly
break
up
and
change
but
up
to
the
first
of
september
nothing
had
done
so
.
as
a
criminal
who
is
being
led
to
execution
knows
that
he
must
die
immediately
but
yet
looks
about
him
and
straightens
the
cap
that
is
awry
on
his
head
so
moscow
involuntarily
continued
its
wonted
life
though
it
knew
that
the
time
of
its
destruction
was
near
when
the
conditions
of
life
to
which
its
people
were
accustomed
to
submit
would
be
completely
upset
.
during
the
three
days
preceding
the
occupa
tion
of
moscow
the
whole
rostov
family
was
absorbed
in
various
activities
.
the
head
of
the
family
count
ilyd
rost6v
continually
drove
about
the
city
collecting
the
current
rumors
from
all
sides
and
gave
superficial
and
hasty
orders
at
home
about
the
preparations
for
their
departure
.
the
countess
watched
the
things
being
packed
was
dissatisfied
with
everything
was
constantly
in
pursuit
of
ptya
who
was
always
running
away
from
her
and
was
jealous
of
natisha
with
whom
he
spent
all
his
time
.
s6n

the
practical
side
of
matters
by
getting
things
packed
.
but
of
late

had
been
particularly

and
silent
.
nicholas

in
which

mentioned
princess
mary
had
elicited
in
her
presence
joyous
comments
from
the
countess
who
saw
an
intervention
of
providence
in
this
meeting
of
the
princess
and
nicholas
.
i
was
never
pleased

the

but
i

ways

peace
s6nya
felt
that
this
was
true
that
the
only
possibility
of
retrieving
the
rostovs
affairs
was
by
nicholas
marrying
a
rich
woman
and
that
the
princess
was
a
good
match
.
it
was
very

ter
for
her

but
despite
her
grief
or
perhaps
just
because
of
it
she
took
on
herself
all
the
difficult
work
of
directing
the
storingand
pack
ing
of
their
things
and
was
busy
for
whole
days
.
the
count
and
countess
turned
to
her
when
they
had
any
orders
to
give
.
ptya
and
nata
sha
on
the
contrary
far
from
helping
their
parents
were
generally
a
nuisance
and
a
hin
drance
to
everyone
.
almost
all
day
long
the
house
resounded
with
their
running
feet
their
cries
and
their
spontaneous
laughter
.
they
laughed
and
were
gay
not
because
there
was
any
reason
to
laugh
but
because
gaiety
and
mirth
were
in
their
hearts
and
so
everything
that
happened
was
a
cause
for
gaiety
and
laughter
to
them
.
phya
was
in
high
spirits
be
cause
having
left
home
a
boy
he
had
returned
as
everybody
told
him
a
fine
young
man
be
cause
he
was
at
home
because
he
had
left
be
laya
tscrkov
where
there
was
no
hope
of
soon
taking
part
in
a
battle
and
had
come
to
mos
cow
where
there
was
to
be
fighting
in
a
few
days
and
chiefly
because
natdsha
whose
lead
he
always
followed
was
in
high
spirits
.
nata
sha
was
gay
because
she
had
been
sad
too
long
and
now
nothing
reminded
her
of
the
cause
of
her
sadness
and
because
she
was
feeling
well
.
she
was
also
happy
because
she
had
someone
to
adore
her
the
adoration
of
others
was
a
lubricant
the
wheels
of
her
machine
needed
to
make
them
run
freely
and
pchya
adored
her
.
above
all
they
were
gay
because
there
was
a
war
near
moscow
there
would
be
fighting
at
the
town
gates
arms
were
being
given
out
everybody
was
escaping
going
away
some
where
and
in
general
something
extraordinary
was
happening
and
that
is
always
exciting
especially
to
the
young
.
chapter
xiii
on
saturday
the
thirtyfirst
of
august
every
thing
in
the
rost6vs
house
seemed
topsyturvy
.
all
the
doors
were
open
all
the
furniture
was
being
carried
out
or
moved
about
and
the
mirrors
and
pictures
had
been
taken
down
.
there
were
trunks
in
the
rooms
and
hay
wrapping
paper
and
ropes
were
scattered
about
.
the
peasants
and
house
serfs
carrying
out
the
things
were
treading
heavily
on
the
parquet
floors
.
the
yard
was
crowded
with
peasant
carts
some
loaded
high
and
already
corded
up
others
still
empty
.

the
voices
and
footsteps
of
the
many
serv
ants
and
of
the
peasants
who
had
come
with
the
carts
resounded
as
they
shouted
to
one
an
other
in
the
yard
and
in
the
house
.
the
count
had
been
out
since
morning
.
the
countess
had
a
headache
brought
on
by
all
the
noise
and
turmoil
and
was
lying
down
in
the
new
sitting
room
with
a
vinegar
compress
on
her
head
.
pdtya
was
not
at
home
he
had
gone
to
visit
a
friend
with
whom
he
meant
to
obtain
a
trans
fer
from
the
militia
to
the
active
army
.
s6nya
was
in
the
ballroom
looking
after
the
packing
of
the
glass
and
china
.
natdsha
was
sitting
on
the
floor
of
her
dismantled
room
with
dresses
ribbons
and
scarves
strewn
all
about
her
gaz
ing
fixedly
at
the
floor
and
holding
in
her
hands
the
old
ball
dress
already
out
of
fash
ion
which
she
had
worn
at
her
first
petersburg
ball
.
natasha
was
ashamed
of
doing
nothing
when
everyone
else
was
so
busy
and
several
times
that
morning
had
tried
to
set
to
work
but
her
heart
was
not
in
it
and
she
could
not
and
did
not
know
how
to
do
anything
except
with
all
her
heart
and
all
her
might
.
for
a
while
she
had
stood
beside
s6nya
while
the
china
was
being
packed
and
tried
to
help
but
soon
gave
it
up
and
went
to
her
room
to
pack
her
own
things
.
at
first
she
found
it
amusing
to
give
away
dresses
and
ribbons
to
the
maids
but
when
that
was
done
and
what
was
left
had
still
to
be
packed
she
found
it
dull
.
dunydsha
you
packl
you
will
wont
you
dear
and
when
dunydsha
willingly
prom
ised
to
do
it
all
for
her
natasha
sat
down
on
the
floor
took
her
old
ball
dress
and
fell
into
a
reverie
quite
unrelated
to
what
ought
to
have
occupied
her
thoughts
now
.
she
was
roused
from
her
reverie
by
the
talk
of
the
maids
in
the
next
room
which
was
theirs
and
by
the
sound
of
their
hurried
footsteps
going
to
the
back
porch
.
natdsha
got
up
and
looked
out
of
the
window
.
an
enormously
long
row
of
carts
full
of
wounded
men
had
stopped
in
the
street
.
the
housekeeper
the
old
nurse
the
cooks
coachmen
maids
footmen
postilions
and
scullions
stood
at
the
gate
staring
at
the
wounded
.
natdsha
throwing
a
clean
pocket
handker
chief
over
her
hair
and
holding
an
end
of
it
in
each
hand
went
out
into
the
street
.
the
former
housekeeper
old
mdvra
kuz
minichna
had
stepped
out
of
the
crowd
by
the
gate
gone
up
to
a
cart
with
a
hood
con
structed
of
bast
mats
and
was
speaking
to
a
pale
young
officer
who
lay
inside
.
natdsha
moved
a
few
steps
forward
and
stopped
shyly
still
holding
her
handkerchief
and
listened
to
what
the
housekeeper
was
saying
.
then
you
have
nobody
in
moscow
she
was
saying
.
you
would
be
more
comfortable
somewhere
in
a
house

..
.
in
ours
for
instance

.

.

.
the
family
are
leaving
.
i
dont
know
if
it
would
be
allowed
re
plied
the
officer
in
a
weak
voice
.
here
is
our
commanding
officer

.

.

.
ask
him
and
he
pointed
to
a
stout
major
who
was
walking
back
along
the
street
past
the
row
of
carts
.
natdsha
glanced
with
frightened
eyes
at
the
face
of
the
wounded
officer
and
at
once
went
to
meet
the
major
.
may
the
wounded
men
stay
in
our
house
she
asked
.
the
major
raised
his
hand
to
his
cap
with
a
smile
.
which
one
do
you
want
maamsellesaid
he
screwing
up
his
eyes
and
smiling
.
natdsha
quietly
repeated
her
question
and
her
face
and
whole
manner
were
so
serious
though
she
was
still
holding
the
ends
of
her
handkerchief
that
the
major
ceased
smiling
and
after
some
reflection
as
if
considering
in
how
far
the
thing
was
possiblereplied
in
the
affirmative
.
oh
yes
why
not
they
may
he
said
.
with
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
natd
sha
stepped
back
quickly
to
mdvra
kuzminich
na
who
stood
talking
compassionately
to
the
officer
.
they
may
.
he
says
they
mayl
whispered
natdsha
.
the
cart
in
which
the
officer
lay
was
turned
into
the
rostovs
yard
and
dozens
of
carts
with
wounded
men
tegan
at
the
invitation
of
the
townsfolk
ttf
turn
into
the
yards
and
to
draw
up
at
the
entrances
of
the
houses
in
po
varskdya
street
.
natdsha
was
evidently
pleased
to
be
dealing
with
new
people
outside
the
ordi
nary
routine
of
her
life
.
she
and
mdvra
kuz
minichna
tried
to
get
as
many
of
the
wounded
as
possible
into
their
yard
.
your
papa
must
be
told
though
said
md
vra
kuzminichna
.
never

never

what

for
one
day
we

.
they

have
all
our
half
of
the
house
.
there
now
young
lady
you

take
things
into
your
head
even
if
we
put
them
into
the
wing
the
mens
room
or
the
nurses
room
we
must
ask
permission
.
488
well
ill
ask
.
natdsha
ran
into
the
house
and
went
on
tip
toe
through
the
halfopen
door
into
the
sitting
room
where
there
was
a
smell
of
vinegar
and
hoffmans
drops
.

are

asleep
mamma
oh
what
sleep
said
the
countess
waking
up
just
as
she
was
dropping
into
a
doze
.
mamma
darlingl
said
natdsha
kneeling
by
her
mother
and
bringing
her
face
close
to
her
mothers
i
am
sorry
forgive
me
ill

er
do
it

they

nowhere

go
.
i
knew
youd
let
them
come

.

.

.
she
said
quickly
all
in
one
breath
.
what
officers
whom
have
they
brought
i
dont
understand
anything
about
it
said
the
countess
.
natdsha
laughed
and
the
countess
too
smiled
slightly
.
i
knew
youd
give
permission

..
.
so
ill
tell
them
and
having
kissed
her
mother
nata
sha
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
.
in
the
hall
she
met
her
father
who
had
re
turned
with
bad
news
.
weve
stayed
too
long
said
the
count
with
involuntary
vexation
.
the
club
is
closed
and
the
police
are
leaving
.
papa
is
it
all
right
ive
invited
some
of
the
wounded
into
the
house
said
natdsha
.
of
course
it
is
he
answered
absently
.
thats
not
the
point
.
i
beg
you
not
to
indulge
in
trifles
now
but
to
help
to
pack
and
tomor
row
we
must
go
go
go

.

.

.
and
the
count
gave
a
similar
order
to
the
majordomo
and
the
servants
.
at
dinner
ptya
having
returned
home
told
them
the
news
he
had
heard
.
he
said
the
peo
ple
had
been
getting
arms
in
the
kremlin
and
that
though
rostopchins
broadsheet
had
said
that
he
would
sound
a
call
two
or
three
days
in
advance
the
order
had
certainly
already
been
given
for
everyone
to
go
armed
to
the
three
hills
tomorrow
and
that
there
would
be
a
big
battle
there
.
the
countess
looked
with
timid
horror
at
her
sons
eager
excited
face
as
he
said
this
.
she
realized
that
if
she
said
a
word
about
his
not
going
to
the
battle
she
knew
he
enjoyed
the
thought
of
the
impending
engagement
he
would
say
something
about
men
honor
and
the
fatherland
something

war
and

and
obstinate
which
there
would
be
no

and
her
plans
would
be
spoiled
and
so
hoping
to
arrange
to
leave
before
then
and
take
pe
tya
with
her
as
their
protector
and
defender
she
did
not
answer
him
but
after
dinner
called
the
count
aside
and
implored
him
with
tears
to
take
her
away
quickly
that
very
night
if
possible
.
with
a
womans
invol
untary
loving
cunning
she
who
till
then
had
not
shown
any
alarm
said
that
she
would
die
of
fright
if
they
did
not
leave
that
very
night
.
without
any
pretense
she
was
now
afraid
of
everything
.
chapter
xiv
madame
schoss
who
had
been
out
to
visit
her
daughter
increased
the
countess
fears
still
more
by
telling
what
she
had
seen
at
a
spirit
dealers
in
myasnftski
street
.
when
returning
by
that
street
she
had
been
unable
to
pass
be
cause
of
a
drunken
crowd
rioting
in
front
of
the
shop
.
she
had
taken
a
cab
and
driven
home
by
a
side
street
and
the
cabman
had
told
her
that
the
people
were
breaking
open
the
bar
rels
at
the
drink
store
having
received
orders
to
do
so
.
after
dinner
the
whole
rost6v
household
set
to
work
with
enthusiastic
haste
packing
their
belongings
and
preparing
for
their
de
parture
.
the
old
count
suddenly
setting
to
work
kept
passing
from
the
yard
to
the
house
and
back
again
shouting
confused
instructions
to
the
hurrying
people
and
flurrying
themstill
more
.
pctya
directed
things
in
the
yard
.
s6nya
owing
to
the
counts
contradictory
orders
lost
her
head
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
the
servants
ran
noisily
about
the
house
and
yard
shouting
and
disputing
.
natdsha
with
the
ar
dor
characteristic
of
all
she
did
suddenly
set
to
work
too
.
at
first
her
intervention
in
the
business
of
packing
was
received
skeptically
.
everybody
expected
some
prank
from
her
and
did
not
wish
to
obey
her
but
she
resolutely
and
passionately
demanded
obedience
grew
angry
and
nearly
cried
because
they
did
not
heed
her
and
at
last
succeeded
in
making
them
believe
her
.
her
first
exploit
which
cost
her
immense
effort
and
established
her
authority
was
the
packing
of
the
carpets
.
the
count
had
valuable
gobelin
tapestries
and
persian
carpets
in
the
house
.
when
natdsha
set
to
work
two
cases
were
standing
open
in
the
ballroom
one
almost
full
up
with
crockery
the
other
with
carpets
.
there
was
also
much
china
standing
on
the
tables
and
still
more
was
being
brought
book
eleven
in
from
the
storeroom
.
a
third
case
was
needed
and
servants
had
gone
to
fetch
it
.
s6nya
wait
a
bit
well
pack
everything
in
to
these
said
natdsha
.
you
cant
miss
we
have
tried
to
said
the
butlers
assistant
.
no
wait
a
minute
please
.
and
natdsha
began
rapidly
taking
out
of
the
case
dishes
and
plates
wrapped
in
paper
.
the
dishes
must
go
in
here
among
the
car
pets
said
she
.
why
its
a
mercy
if
we
can
get
the
carpets
alone
into
three
cases
said
the
butlers
assist
ant
.
oh
wait
please
and
natdsha
began
rapidly
and
deftly
sorting
out
the
things
.
these
arent
needed
said
she
putting
aside
some
plates
of
kiev
ware
.
these
yes
these
must
go
among
the
carpets
she
said
referring
to
the
saxony
china
dishes
.
dont
natdsha
leave
it
alone
well
get
it
all
packed
urged
s6nya
reproachfully
.
what
a
young
lady
she
is
remarked
the
majordomo
.
but
natdsha
would
not
give
in
.
she
turned
everything
out
and
began
quickly
repacking
deciding
that
the
inferior
russian
carpets
and
unnecessary
crockery
should
not
be
taken
at
all
.
when
everything
had
been
taken
out
of
the
cases
they
recommenced
packing
and
it
turned
out
that
when
the
cheaper
things
not
worth
taking
had
nearly
all
been
rejected
the
valuable
ones
really
did
all
go
into
the
two
cases
.
only
the
lid
of
the
case
containing
the
carpets
would
not
shut
down
.
a
few
more
things
might
have
been
taken
out
but
natd
sha
insisted
on
having
her
own
way
.
she
packed
repacked
pressed
made
the
butlers
assistant
and
ptya
whom
she
had
drawn
in
to
the
business
of
packing
press
on
the
lid
and
made
desperate
efforts
herself
.
thats
enough
natdsha
said
s6nya
.
i
see
you
were
right
but
just
take
out
the
top
one
.
i
wont
cried
natdsha
with
one
hand
holding
back
the
hair
that
hung
over
her
per
spiring
face
while
with
the
other
she
pressed
down
the
carpets
.
now
press
petya
press
vasflich
press
hard
she
cried
.
the
carpets
yielded
and
the
lid
closed
na
tdsha
clapping
her
hands
screamed
with
de
light
and
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
.
but
this
only
lasted
a
moment
.
she
at
once
set
to
work
afresh
and
they
now
trusted
her
completely
.
the
count
was
not
angry
even
when
they
told
him
that
natdsha
had
countermanded
an
order
of
489
his
and
the
servants
now
came
to
her
to
ask
whether
a
cart
was
sufficiently
loaded
and
whether
it
might
be
corded
up
.
thanks
to
na
tashas
directions
the
work
now
tvent
on
ex
peditiously
unnecessary
things
were
left
and
the
most
valuable
packed
as
compactly
as
pos
sible
.
but
hard
as
they
all
worked
till
quite
late
that
night
they
could
not
get
everything
packed
.
the
countess
had
fallen
asleep
and
the
count
having
put

their
departure
till
next
morning
went
to
bed
.
s6nya
and
natasha
slept
in
the
sitting
room
without
undressing
.
that
night
another
wounded
man
was
driven
down
the
povarskdya
and
mdvra
kuz
mfnichna
who
was
standing
at
the
gate
had
him
brought
into
the
rost6vs
yard
.
mdvra
kuzminichna
concluded
that
he
wis
a
very
im
portant
man
.
he
was
being
conveyed
in
a
ca
idchevfitli
a
raised
hood
and
was
quite
covered
by
an
apron
.
on
the
box
beside
the
driver
sat
a
venerable
old
attendant
.
a
doctor
and
two
soldiers
followed
the
carriage
in
a
cart
.
please
come
in
here
.
the
masters
are
going
away
and
the
whole
house
will
be
empty
said
the
old
woman
to
the
old
attendant
.
well
perhaps
said
he
with
a
sigh
.
we
dont
expect
to
get
him
home
alive
we
have
a
house
of
our
own
in
moscow
but
its
a
long
way
from
here
and
theres
nobody
living
in
it
.
do
us
the
honor
to
come

theres
plenty
of
everything

the
masters
house
.
come

said
mdvra
kuzmfnichna
.
is
he
very
ill
she
asked
.
the
attendant
made
a
hopeless
gesture
.
we
dont
expect
to
get
him
home
we
must
ask
the
doctor
.
and
the
old
servant
got
down
from
the
box
and
went
up
to
the
cart
.
all
right
said
the
doctor
.
the
old
servant
returned
to
the
calche
looked
into
it
shook
his
head
disconsolately
told
the
driver
to
turn
into
the
yard
and
stopped
beside
mdvra
kuzminichna
.
o
lord
jesus
christ
she
murmured
.
she
invited
them
to
take
the
wounded
man
into
the
house
.
the
masters
wont
object

.

.

.
she
said
.
but
they
had
to
avoid
carrying
the
man
up
stairs
and
so
they
took
him
into
the
wing
and
put
him
in
the
room
that
had
been
madame
schoss
.
this
wounded
man
was

chapter

moscows
last
day
had
come
.
it
was
a
clear
bright
autumn
day
a
sunday
.
the
church
bells
everywhere
were
ringing
for
service
just
as
usual
on
sundays
.
nobody
seemed
yet
to
re
alize
what
awaited
the
city
.
only
two
things
indicated
the
social
condi
tion
of
moscow
the
rabble
that
is
the
poor
people
and
the
price
of
commodities
.
an
enormous
crowd
of
factory
hands
house
serfs
and
peasants
with
whom
some
officials
semi
narists
and
gentry
were
mingled
had
gone
early
that
morning
to
the
three
hills
.
having
waited
there
for
rostopchfn
who
did
not
turn
up
they
became
convinced
that
moscow
would
be
surrendered
and
then
dispersed
all
about
the
town
to
the
public
houses
and
cookshops
.
prices
too
that
day
indicated
the
state
of
af
fairs
.
the
price
of
weapons
of
gold
of
carts
and
horses
kept
rising
but
the
value
of
paper
money
and
city
articles
kept
falling
so
that
by
midday
there
were
instances
of
carters
re
moving
valuable
goods
such
as
cloth
and
re
ceiving
in
payment
a
half
of
what
they
carted
while
peasant
horses
were
fetching
five
hun
dred
rubles
each
and
furniture
mirrors
and
bronzes
were
being
given
away
for
nothing
.
in
the
rostovs
staid
oldfashioned
house
the
dissolution
of
former
conditions
of
life
was
but
little
noticeable
.
as
to
the
serfs
the
only
indi
cation
was
that
three
out
of
their
huge
retinue
disappeared
during
the
night
but
nothing
was
stolen
and
as
to
the
value
of
their
possessions
the
thirty
peasant
carts
that
had
come
in
from
their
estates
and
which
many
people
envied
proved
to
be
extremely
valuable
and
they
were
offered
enormous
sums
of
money
for
them
.
not
only
were
huge
sums
offered
for
the
horses
and
carts
but
on
the
previous
evening
and
early
in
the
morning
of
the
first
of
september
orderlies
and
servants
sent
by
wounded
officers
came
to
the
rost6vs
yard
and
wounded
men
dragged
themselves
there
from
the
rost6vs
and
from
neighboring
houses
where
they
were
accommodated
entreating
the
servants
to
try
to
get
them
a
lift
out
of
moscow
.
the
major
domo
to
whom
these
en
treaties
were
addressed
though
he
was
sorry
for
the
wounded
resolute
ly
refused
saying
that
he
dare
not
even
men
tion
the
matter
to
the
count
.
pity
these
wound
ed
men
as
one
might
it
was
evident
that
if
they
were
given
one
cart
there
would
be
no
reason
to
refuse
another
or
all
the
carts
and
ones
own
carriages
as
well
.
thirty
carts
could
not
save
all
the
wounded
and
in
the
general
catastrophe
one
could
not
disregard
oneself
and
ones
own
family
.
so
thought
the
majordomo
on
his
masters
behalf
.
on
waking
up
that
morning
count
ilyd
ros
t6v
left
his
bedroom
softly
so
as
not
to
wake
the
countess
who
had
fallen
asleep
only
toward
morning
and
came
out
to
the
porch
in
his
lilac
silk
dressing
gown
.
in
the
yard
stood
the
carts
ready
corded
.
the
carriages
were
at
the
front
porch
.
the
majordomo
stood
at
the
porch
talking
to
an
elderly
orderly
and
to
a
pale
young
officer
with
a
bandaged
arm
.
on
seeing
the
count
the
majordomo
made
a
significant
and
stern
gesture
to
them
both
to
go
away
.
well
vasflich
is
everything
ready
asked
the
count
and
stroking
his
bald
head
he
looked
goodnaturedly
at
the
officer
and
the
orderly
and
nodded
to
them
.
he
liked
to
see
new
faces
.
we
can
harness
at
once
your
excellency
.
well
thats
right
.
as
soon
as
the
countess
wakes
well
be
off
god
willing
what
is
it
gentlemen
he
added
turning
to
the
officer
.
are
you
staying
in
my
house
the
officer
came
nearer
and
suddenly
his
face
flushed
crimson
.
count
be
so
good
as
to
allow
me

.

.

.
for
gods
sake
to
get
into
some
corner
of
one
of
your
carts
i
i
have
nothing
here
with
me
.

..
.
i
shall
be
all
right
on
a
loaded
cart

before
the
officer
had
finished
speaking
the
orderly
made
the
same
request
on
behalf
of
his
master
.
oh
yes
yes
yes
said
the
count
hastily
.
i
shall
be
very
pleased
very
pleased
.
vasilich
youll
see
to
it
.
just
unload
one
or
two
carts
.
well
what
of
it

..
.
do
whats
necessary

.

.

.
said
the
count
muttering
some
indefinite
or
der
.
but
at
the
same
moment
an
expression
of
warm
gratitude
on
the
officers
face
had
al
ready
sealed
the
order
.
the
count
looked
around
him
.
in
the
yard
at
the
gates
at
the
window
of
the
wings
wounded
officers
and
their
orderlies
were
to
be
seen
.
they
were
all
looking
at
the
count
and
moving
toward
the
porch
.
please
step
into
the
gallery
your
excel
lency
said
the
majordomo
.
what
are
your
orders
about
the
pictures
the
count
went
into
the
house
with
him
repeating
his
order
not
to
refuse
the
wounded
who
asked
for
a
lift
.
well
never
mind
some
of
the
things
can
be
unloaded
he
added
in
a
soft
confidential
voice
as
though
afraid
of
being
overheard
.
at
nine
oclock
the
countess
woke
up
and
book
matrena
timoteevna
who
had
been
her
ladys
maid
before
her
marriage
and
now
performed
a
sort
of
chief
gendarmes
duty
for
her
came
to
say
that
madame
schoss
was
much
offended
and
the
young
ladies
summer
dresses
could
not
be
left
behind
.
on
inquiry
the
countess
learned
that
madame
schoss
was
offended
be
cause
her
trunk
had
been
taken
down
from
its
cart
and
all
the
loads
were
being
uncorded
and
the
luggage
taken
out
of
the
carts
to
make
room
for
wounded
men
whom
the
count
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
had
ordered
that
they
should
take
with
them
.
the
countess
sent
for
her
husband
.
what
is
this
my
dear
i
hear
that
the
lug
gage
is
being
unloaded
you
know
love
i
wanted
to
tell
you

.

.

.
countess
dear

..
.
an
officer
came
to
me
to
ask
for
a
few
carts
for
the
wounded
.
after
all
ours
are
things
that
can
be
bought
but
think
what
being
left
behind
means
to
them

.

.

.
really
now
in
our
own
yardwe
asked
them
in
our
selves
and
there
are
officers
among
them
.

.

.

.
you
know
i
think
my
dear

..
.
let
them
be
taken

.

.

.
wheres
the
hurry
the
count
spoke
timidly
as
he
always
did
when
talking
of
money
matters
.
the
countess
was
accustomed
to
this
tone
as
a
precursor
of
news
of
something
detrimental
to
the
chil
drens
interests
such
as
the
building
of
a
new
gallery
or
conservatory
the
inauguration
of
a
private
theater
or
an
orchestra
.
she
was
accus
tomed
always
to
oppose
anything
announced
in
that
timid
tone
and
considered
it
her
duty
to
do
so
.
she
assumed
her
dolefully
submissive
man
ner
and
said
to
her
husband
listen
to
me
count
you
have
managed
matters
so
that
we
are
getting
nothing
for
the
house
and
now
you
wish
to
throw
away
all
our
all
the
childrens
property
1
you
said
yourself
that
we
have
a
hundred
thousand
rubles
worth
of
things
in
the
house
.
i
dont
consent
my
dear
i
dont
do
as
you
please
its
the
governments
business
to
look
after
the
wounded
they
know
that
.
look
at
the
lopukhfns
opposite
they
cleared
out
everything
two
days
ago
.
thats
what
other
peo
ple
do
.
its
only
we
who
are
such
fools
.
if
you
have
no
pity
on
me
have
some
for
the
chil
dren
.
flourishing
his
arms
in
despair
the
count
left
the
room
without
replying
.
papa
what
are
you
doing
that
for
asked
natasha
who
had
followed
him
into
her
mothers
room
.
nothing

it
of
yours
eleven

muttered
the
count
angrily
.
but
i
heard
said
natdsha
.
why
does
mamma
object
what
business
is
it
of
yours
cried
the
count
.
natdsha
stepped
up
to
the
window
and
pon
dered
.
papa
heres
berg
coming
to
see
us
said
she
looking
out
of
the
window
.
chapter
xvi
berg
the
rost6vs
soninlaw
was
already
a
colonel
wearing
the
orders
of
vladimir
and
anna
and
he
still
filled
the
quiet
and
agree
able
post
of
assistant
to
the
head
of
the
staff
of
the
assistant
commander
of
the
first
division
of
the
second
army
.
on
the
first
of
september
he
had
come
to
moscow
from
the
army
.
he
had
nothing
to
do
in
moscow
but
he
had
noticed
that
everyone
in
the
army
was
asking
for
leave
to
visit
moscow
and
had
something
to
do
there
.
so
he
considered
it
necessary
to
ask
for
leave
of
absence
for
family
and
domes
tic
reasons
.
berg
drove
up
to
his
fatherinlaws
house
in
his
spruce
little
trap
with
a
pair
of
sleek
roans
exactly
like
those
of
a
certain
prince
.
he
looked
attentively
at
the
carts
in
the
yard
and
while
going
up
to
the
porch
took
out
a
clean
pocket
handkerchief
and
tied
a
knot
in
it
.
from
the
anteroom
berg
ran
with
smooth
though
impatient
steps
into
the
drawing
room
where
he
embraced
the
count
kissed
the
hands
of
natdsha
and
s6nya
and
hastened
to
inquire
after
mammas
health
.
health
at
a
time
like
this
said
the
count
.
come
tell
us
the
news
is
the
army
retreating
or
will
there
be
another
battle
god
almighty
alone
can
decide
the
fate
of
our
fatherland
papa
said
berg
.
the
army
is
burning
with
a
spirit
of
heroism
and
the
leaders
so
to
say
have
now
assembled
in
coun
cil
.
no
one
knows
what
is
coming
.
but
in
gen
eral
i
can
tell
you
papa
that
such
a
heroic
spirit
the
truly
antique
valor
of
the
russian
army
which
they
which
it
he
corrected
himself
has
shown
or
displayed
in
the
battle
of
the
twentysixththere
are
no
words
worthy
to
do
it
justice
i
tell
you
papa
he
smote
himself
on
the
breast
as
a
general
he
had
heard
speaking
had
done
but
berg
did
it
a
trifle
late
for
he
should
have
struck
his
breast
at
the
words
russian
army
i
tell
you
frankly
that
we
the
commanders
far
from
having
to
urge
the
men
on
or
anything
of
that
kind
could
hardly
49
restrain
those

those

.

.

.
yes
those
exploits
of
antique
valor
he
went
on
rapidly
.
gen

barclay
de
tollyrisked
his
life
everywhere
at
the
head
of
the
troops
i
can
assure
you
.
our
corps
was
stationed
on
a
hillside
.
you
can
im
agine
and
berg
related
all
that
he
remembered
of
the
various
talcs
he
had
heard
those
days
.
na
tdsha
watched
him
with
an
intent
gaze
that
confused
him
as
if
she
were
trying
to
find
in
his
face
the
answer
to
some
question
.
altogether
such
heroism
as
was
displayed
by
the
russian
warriors
cannot
be
imagined
or
adequately
praised
said
berg
glancing
round
at
natasha
and
as
if
anxious
to
conciliate
her
replying
to
her
intent
look
with
a
smile
.

rus
sia
is
not
in
moscow
she
lives
in
the
hearts
of
her
sons
isnt
it
so
papa
said
he
.
just
then
the
countess
came
in
from
the
sit
ting
room
with
a
weary
and
dissatisfied
expres
sion
.
berg
hurriedly
jumped
up
kissed
her
hand
asked
about
her
health
and
swaying
his
head
from
side
to
side
to
express
sympathy
re
mained
standing
beside
her
.
yes
mamma
i
tell
you
sincerely
that
these
are
hard
and
sad
times
for
every
russian
.
but
why
are
you
so
anxious
you
have
still
time
to
get
away
.

.

.

.
i
cant
think
what
the
servants
are
about
said
the
countess
turning
to
her
husband
.
i
have
just
been
told
that
nothing
is
ready
yet
.
somebody
after
all
must
see
to
things
.
one
misses
mitenka
at
such
times
.
there
wont
be
any
end
to
it
.
the
count
was
about
to
say
something
but
evidently
restrained
himself
.
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
went
to
the
door
.
at
that
moment
berg
drew
out
his
handker
chief
as
if
to
blow
his
nose
and
seeing
the
knot
in
it
pondered
shaking
his
head
sadly
and
sig
nificantly
.
and
i
have
a
great
favor
to
ask
of
you

he
.

.
said
the
count
and
stopped
.
i
was
driving
past
yusupovs
house
just
now
said
berg
with
a
laugh
when
the
stew
ard
a
man
i
know
ran
out
and
asked
me
whether
i
wouldnt
buy
something
.
i
went
in
out
of
curiosity

and
there
is
a
small
chiffonier
and
a
dressing
table
.

and
how

had
a
dispute

.
at

men
tion
of
the
chiffonier
and

berg
involuntarily
changed
his
tone
to
one
of
pleas

his
admirable
domestic
arrangements
.
and
its

berg

the

my

in

he
left
the

the
countess
began
to
cry
.

natdsha
left
the
room
with
her
father
and
as
if
finding
it
difficult
to
reach
some
decision
first
followed
him
and
then
ran
downstairs
.
petya
was
in
the
porch
engaged
in
giving
out
weapons
to
the
servants
who
were
to
leave
moscow
.
the
loaded
carts
were
still
standing
in
the
yard
.
two
of
them
had
been
uncorded
and
a
wounded
officer
was
climbing
into
one
of
them
helped
by
an
orderly
.

natasha

she
understood
that
he
meant
what
were
their
parents
quarreling
about

she
did
not
answer
.

her
throat
quivered
with
convulsive
sobs
and
afraid
of

and
letting
the
force
of
her
anger
run
to

she
turned
and
rushed
headlong
up
the
stairs
.
berg
was
sitting
beside
the
countess
consol
ing
her
with
the
respectful
attention
of
a
rela
tive
.
the
count
pipe
in
hand
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
when
natasha
her
face
distorted
by
anger
burst
in
like
a
tempest
and
approached
her
mother
with
rapid
steps
.
its
horrid
its
abominable
she
screamed
.
you
cant
possibly
have
ordered
it
berg
and
the
countess
looked
at
her
per
plexed
and
frightened
.
the
count
stood
still
at
the
window
and
listened
.

.

.

.
its

the
count
stood
by
the
window
and
listened
without
turning
round
.
suddenly
he
sniffed
and
put
his
face
closer
to
the
window
.
the
countess
glanced
at
her
daughter
saw
her
face
full
of
shame
for
her
mother
saw
her
agitation
and
understood
why
her
husband
did
not
turn
to
look
at
her
now
and
she
glanced
round
quite
disconcerted
.
oh

as
you

i

she
said
not
surrendering
at
once
.
mamma
darling
forgive

but
the
countess
pushed
her
daughter
away
and
went
up
to
her
husband
.
my
dear

what

.

.

.

.

she
dropping
her
eyes
shamefacedly
.

eggs

.

.

.
muttered
the
count
through
tears
of
joy
and
he
embraced
his
wife
who
was
glad
to
hide
her
look
of
shame
on
his
breast
.
papa
mamma
may
i
see

.

.
asked
natdsha
.
we
will
still
take
all
the
most
necessary
things
.
the
count
nodded
affirmatively
and
na
tdsha
at
the
rapid
pace
at
which
she
used
to
run
when
playing
at
tag
ran
through
the
ball
room
to
the
anteroom
and
downstairs
into
the
yard
.
the
servants
gathered
round
natdsha
but
could
not
believe
the
strange
order
she
brought
them
until
the
count
himself
in
his
wiles
name
confirmed
the
order
to
give
up
all
the
carts
to
the
wounded
and
take
the
trunks
to
the
storerooms
.
when
they
understood
that
order
the
servants
set
to
work
at
this
new
task
with
pleasure
and
zeal
.
it
no
longer
seemed
strange
to
them
but
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
the
only
thing
that
could
be
done
just
as
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
it
had
not
seemed
strange
to
anyone
that
the
wounded
should
be
left
be
hind
and
the
goods
carted
away
but
that
had
seemed
the
only
thing
to
do
.
the
whole
household
as
if
to
atone
for
not
having
done
it
sooner
set
eagerly
to
work
at
the
new
task
of
placing
the
wounded
in
the
carts
.
the
wounded
dragged
themselves
out
of
their
rooms
and
stood
with
pale
but
happy
faces
round
the
carts
.
the
news
that
carts
were
to
be
had
spread
to
the
neighboring
houses
from
which
wounded
men
began
to
come
into
the
rost6vs
yard
.
many
of
the
wounded
asked
them
not
to
unload
the
carts
but
only
to
let
them
sit
on
the
top
of
the
things
.
but
the
work
of
unloading
once
started
could
not
be
arrested
.
it
seemed
not
to
matter
whether
all
or
only
half
the
things
were
left
behind
.
cases
full
of
china
bronzes
pictures
and
mirrors
that
had
been
so
carefully
packed
the
night
before
now
lay
about
the
yard
and
still
they
went
on
searching
for
and
finding
possibili
ties
of
unloading
this
or
that
and
letting
the
wounded
have
another
and
yet
another
cart
.
we
can
take
four
more
men
said
the
steward
.
they
can
have
my
trap
or
else
what
is
to
become
of
them
let
them
have
my
wardrobe
cart
said
the
countess
.
dunyasha
can
go
with
me
in
the
carriage
.
they
unloaded
the
wardrobe
cart
and
sent
it
to
take
wounded
men
from
a
house
two
doors
off
.
the
whole
household
servants
in
cluded
was
bright
and
animated
.
natdsha
was
in
a
state
of
rapturous
excitement
such
as
she
had
not
known
for
a
long
time
.
what
could
we
fasten
this
onto
asked
the
servants
trying
to
fix
a
trunk
on
the
narrow
footboard
behind
a
carriage
.
we
must
keep
at
least
one
cart
.
whats
in
it
asked
natasha
.
the
counts
books
.
leave
it
vasilich
will
put
it
away
.
its
not
wanted
.
the
phaeton
was
full
of
people
and
there
was
a
doubt
as
to
where
count
peter
could
sit
.
on
the
box
.
youll
sit
on
the
box
wont
you
ptya
cried
natdsha
.
s6nya
too
was
busy
all
this
time
but
the
aim
of
her
efforts
was
quite
different
from
natd
shas
.
she
was
putting
away
the
things
that
had
to
be
left
behind
and
making
a
list
of
them
as
the
countess
wished
and
she
tried
to
get
as
much
taken
away
with
them
as
possible
.
chapter
xvii
before
two
oclock
in
the
afternoon
the
ros
t6vs
four
carriages
packed
full
and
with
the
horses
harnessed
stood
at
the
front
door
.
one
by
one
the
carts
with
the
wounded
had
moved
out
of
the
yard
.
the
caliche
in
which
prince
andrew
was
be
ing
taken
attracted
s6nyas
attention
as
it
passed
the
front
porch
.
with
the
help
of
a
maid
she
was
arranging
a
seat
for
the
countess
in
the
huge
high
coach
that
stood
at
the
entrance

whose
caleche
is
that
she
inquired
lean
ing
out
of
the
carriage
window
.
why
didnt

know
miss
replied
the
maid
.
the
wounded
prince
he
spent
the
night
in
our
house
and
is
going
with
us
.
but
who
is

whats
his
name
its
our
intended
that
was
prince
bolk6n
ski
himself
they
say
he
is
dying
replied
the
maid
with
a
sigh
.
s6nya
jumped
out
of
the
coach
and
ran
to
the
countess
.
the
countess
tired
out
and
al
ready
dressed
in
shawl
and
bonnet
for
her
journey
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
drawing
room
waiting
for
the
household
to
assemble
for
the
usual
silent
prayer
with
closed
doors
before
starting
.
natdsha
was
not
in
the
room
.
mamma
said
s6nya
prince
andrew
is
here
mortally
wounded
.
he
is
going
with
us
.
the
countess
opened
her
eyes
in
dismay
and
seizing
s6nyas
arm
glanced
around
.
natasha
she
murmured
.
at
that
moment
this
news
had
only
one
sig
nificance
for
both
of
them
.
they
knew
their
natdsha
and
alarm
as
to
what
would
happen
if
she
heard
this
news
stifled
all
sympathy
for
the
man
they
both
liked
.
natdsha
does
not
know
yet
but
he
is
go
ing
with
us
said
s6nya
.
you
say
he
is
dying
s6nya
nodded
.
the
countess
put
her
arms
around
s6nya
and
began
to
cry
.
the
ways
of
god
are
past
finding
out
she
thought
feeling
that
the
almighty
hand
hitherto
unseen
was
becoming
manifest
in
all
that
was
now
taking
place
.
well
mamma
everything
is
ready
.
whats
the
matter
asked
natdsha
as
with
animated
face
she
ran
into
the
room
.
nothing
answered
the
countess
.
if
ev
erything
is
ready
let
us
start
.
and
the
countess
bent
over
her
reticule
to
hide
her
agitated
face
.
s6nya
embraced
na
tsha
and
kissed
her
.
natdsha
looked
at
her
inquiringly
.
what
is
it
what
has
happened
nothing

.

.

.
no

.

.

.
is
it
something
very
bad
for
me
what
is
it
persisted
natdsha
with
her
quick
intuition
.
sonya
sighed
and
made
no
reply
.
the
count
pdtya
madame
schoss
mdvra
kuzmf
nichna
and
vasflich
came
into
the
drawing
room
and
having
closed
the
doors
they
all
sat
down
and
remained
for
some
moments
silently
seated
without
looking
at
one
an
other
.
the
count
was
the
first
to
rise
and
with
a
loud
sigh
crossed
himself
before
the
icon
.
all
the
others
did
the
same
.
then
the
count
em
braced
mdvra
kuzmfnichna
and
vasflich
who
were
to
remain
in
moscow
and
while
they
caught
at
his
hand
and
kissed
his
shoulder
he
patted
their
backs
lightly
with
some
vaguely
affectionate
and
comforting
words
.
the
count
ess
went
into
the
oratory
and
there
s6nya
found
her
on
her
knees
before
the
icons
that
had
been
left
here
and
there
hanging
on
the
wall
.
the
most
precious
ones
with
which
some
family
tradition
was
connected
were
being
taken
with
them
.
in
the
porch
and
in
the
yard
the
men
whom
ptya
had
armed
with
swords
and
daggers
with
trousers
tucked
inside
their
high
boots
and
with
belts
and
girdles
tightened
were
taking
leave
of
those
remaining
behind
.
as
is
always
the
case
at
a
departure
much
had
been
forgotten
or
put
in
the
wrong
place
and
for
a
long
time
two
menservants
stood
one
on
each
side
of
the
open
door
and
the
carnage
steps
waiting
to
help
the
countess
in
while
maids
rushed
with
cushions
and
bundles
from
the
house
to
the
carriages
the
caleche
the
pha
eton
and
back
again
.
they
always
will
forget
every
thingl
said
the
countess
.
dont
you
know
i
cant
sit
like
that
and
dunyasha
with
clenched
teeth
with
out
replying
but
with
an
aggrieved
look
on
her
face
hastily
got
into
the
coach
to
rearrange
the
seat
.
oh
those
servants
said
the
count
sway
ing
his
head
.
efim
the
old
coachman
who
was
the
only
one
the
countess
trusted
to
drive
her
sat
perched
up
high
on
the
box
and
did
not
so
much
as
glance
round
at
what
was
going
on
be
hind
him
.
from
thirty
years
experience
he
knew
it
would
be
some
time
yet
before
the
or
der
be
off
in
gods
name
would
be
given
him
and
he
knew
that
even
when
it
was
said
he
would
be
stopped
once
or
twice
more
while
they
sent
back
to
fetch
something
that
had
been
forgotten
and
even
after
that
he
would
again
be
stopped
and
the
countess
herself
would
lean
out
of
the
window
and
beg
him
for
the
love
of
heaven
to
drive
carefully
down
the
hill
.
he
knew
all
this
and
therefore
waited
calmly
for
what
would
happen
with
more
pa
tience
than
the
horses
especially
the
near
one
the
chestnut
falcon
who
was
pawing
the
ground
and
champing
his
bit
.
at
last
all
were
seated
the
carriage
steps
were
folded
and
book

pulled
up
the
door
was
shut
somebody
was
sent
for
a
traveling
case
and
the
countess
leaned
out
and
said
what
she
had
to
say
.
then
efim
deliberately
doffed
his
hat
and
began
crossing
himself

the

the
horses
the
off
pole

tugged
at
his
collar
the
high
springs
creaked
and
the
body
of
the
coach
swayed
.
the
foot
man
sprang
onto
the
box
of
the
moving
coach
which
jolted
as
it
passed
out
of
the
yard
onto
the
uneven
roadway
the
other
vehicles
jolted
in
their
turn
and
the
procession
of
carriages
moved
up
the
street
.
in
the
carriages
the
cale
che
f
and
the
phaeton
all
crossed
themselves
as
they
passed
the
church
opposite
the
house
.
those
who
were
to
remain
in
moscow
walked
on
either
side
of
the
vehicles
seeing
the
trav
elers
off
.
rarely
had
natasha
experienced
so
joyful
a
feeling
as
now
sitting
in
the
carriage
beside
the
countess
and
gazing
at
the
slowly
receding
walls
of
forsaken
agitated
moscow
.
occasion
ally
she
leaned
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
looked
back
and
then
forward
at
the
long
train
of
wounded
in
front
of
them
.
almost
at
the
head
of
the
line
she
could
see
the
raised
hood
of
prince
andrews
caliche
.
she
did
not
know
who
was
in
it
but
each
time
she
looked
at
the
procession
her
eyes
sought
that
caleche
.
she
knew
it
was
right
in
front
.
in
kiidrino
from
the
nikftski
prdsnya
and
podnovinsk
streets
came
several
other
trains
of
vehicles
similar
to
the
rost6vs
and
as
they
passed
along
the
sad6vaya
street
the
carriages
and
carts
formed
two
rows
abreast
.
as
they
were
going
round
the
siikharev
wa
ter
tower
natasha
who
was
inquisitively
and
alertly
scrutinizing
the
people
driving
or
walk

past
suddenly
cried
out
in
joyful
surprise

natdsha
putting
her
head
out
of
the
car
riage
and
staring
at
a
tall
stout
man
in
a
coach
mans
long
coat
who
from
his
manner
of
walk
ing
and
moving
was
evidently
a
gentleman
in
disguise
and
who
was
passing
under
the
arch
of
the
siikharev
tower
accompanied
by
a
small
sallowfaced
beardless
old
man
in
a
frieze
coat
.
yes
it
really
is
bezukhov
in
a
coachmans
coat
with
a
queerlooking
old
boy

natdsha

natdsha
ill

my
head
its
he

assure
you

she
cried
to
the
coachman
.
but
the
coachman
could
not
stop
for
from
the
meshchdnski
street
came
more
carts
and
carriages
and
the
rost6vs
were
being
shouted
at
to
move
on
and
not
block
the
way
.
in
fact
however
though
now
much
farther
off
than
before
the
rost6vs
all
saw

someone
extraordinarily
like
him
in
a
coach

coat
going
down
the
street
with
head
bent
and
a
serious
face
beside
a
small

old
man
who
looked
like
a
footman
.
that
old
man
noticed
a
face
thrust
out
of
the
car
riage
window
gazing
at
them
and
respectfully
touching
pierres
elbow
said
something
to
him
and
pointed
to
the
carriage
.
pierre
evidently
engrossed
in
thought
could
not
at
first
under
stand
him
.
at
length
when
he
had
understood
and
looked
in
the
direction
the
old
man
indi
cated
he
recognized
natdsha
and
following
his
first
impulse
stepped
instantly
and
rapidly
toward
the
coach
.
but
having
taken
a
dozen
steps
he
seemed
to
remember
something
and
stopped
.
natdshas
face
leaning
out
of
the
window
beamed
with
quizzical
kindliness
.

she
cried
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
.

this
pierre
took
her
outstretched
hand
and
kissed
it
awkwardly
as
he
walked
along
beside
her
while
the
coach
still
moved
on
.
what
is
the
matter
count
asked
the
countess
in
a
surprised
and
commiserating
tone
.
what

said
pierre
and
looked
round
at
natdsha
whose
radiant
happy
expression
of
which
he
was
conscious
without
looking
at
her
filled
him
with
enchantment
.

remaining
in
moscow
then
pierre
hesitated
.
in

he
said
in
a
questioning
tone
.

pierre
glanced
absently
at
natdsha
and
was
about
to
say
something
but
the
countess
inter
rupted
him
.

he
began
but
natdsha
interrupted
him
.

but

he
muttered
.
its
an
awful
time
and
dropping
behind
the
carriage
he
stepped
onto
the
pavement
.
natdsha
continued
to
lean
out
of
the
win
dow
for
a
long
time
beaming
at
him
with
her
kindly
slightly
quizzical
happy
smile

chapter
xviii
for
the
lasttwo
days
ever
since
leavinghome
pierre
had
been
living
in
the
empty
house
of
his
deceased
benefactor
bazddev
.
this
is
how
it
happened
.
when
he
woke
up
on
the
morning
after
his
return
to
moscow
and
his
interview
with
count
rostopchfn
he
could
not
for
some
time
make
out
where
he
was
and
what
was
expected
of
him
.
when
he
was
informed
that
among
others
awaiting
him
in
his
reception
room
there
was
a
frenchman
who
had
brought
a
let
ter
from
his
wife
the
countess
hellene
he
felt
suddenly
overcome
by
that
sense
of
confusion
and
hopelessness
to
which
he
was
apt
to
suc
cumb
.
he
felt
that
everything
was
now
at
an
end
all
was
in
confusion
and
crumbling
to
pieces
that
nobody
was
right
or
wrong
the
future
held
nothing
and
there
was
no
escape
from
this
position
.
smiling
unnaturally
and
muttering
to
himself
he
first
sat
down
on
the
sofa
in
an
attitude
of
despair
then
rose
went
to
the
door
of
the
reception
room
and
peeped
through
the
crack
returned
flourishing
his
arms
and
took
up
a
book
.
his
majordomo
came
in
a
second
time
to
say
that
the
french
man
who
had
brought
the
letter
from
the
countess
was
very
anxious
to
see
him
if
only
for
a
minute
and
that
someone
from
bazdevs
widow
had
called
to
ask
pierre
to
take
charge
of
her
husbands
books
as
she
herself
was
leav
ing
for
the
country
.
oh
yes
in
a
minute
wait

..
.
or
no
no
of
course

..
.
go
and
say
i
will
come
directly
pierre
replied
to
the
majordomo
.
but
as
soon
as
the
man
had
left
the
room
pierre
took
up
his
hat
which
was
lying
on
the
table
and
went
out
of
his
study
by
the
other
door
.
there
was
no
one
in
the
passage
.
he
went
along
the
whole
length
of
this
passage
to
the
stairs
and
frowning
and
rubbing
his
fore
head
with
both
hands
went
down
as
far
as
the
first
landing
.
the
hall
porter
was
standing
at
the
front
door
.
from
the
landing
where
pierre
stood
there
was
a
second
staircase
leading
to
the
back
entrance
.
he
went
down
that
stair
case
and
out
into
the
yard
.
no
one
had
seen
him
.
but
there
were
some
carriages
waiting
and
as
soon
as
pierre
stepped
out
of
the
gate
the
coachmen
and
the
yard
porter
noticed
him
and
raised
their
caps
to
him
.
when
he
felt
he
was
being
looked
at
he
behaved
like
an
ostrich
which
hides
its
head
in
a
bush
in
order
not
to
be
seen
he
hung
his
head
and
quickening
his
pace
went
down
the
street
.
of
all
the
affairs
awaiting
pierre
that
day
the
sorting
of
joseph
bazdevs
books
and
papers
appeared
to
him
the
most
necessary
.
he
hired
the
first
cab
he
met
and
told
the
driver
to
go
to
the
patriarchs
ponds
where
the
widow
bazdevs
house
was
.
continually
turning
round
to
look
at
the
rows
of
loaded
carts
that
were
making
their
way
from
all
sides
out
of
moscow
and
balanc
ing
his
bulky
body
so
as
not
to
slip
out
f
the
ramshackle
old
vehicle
pierre
experiencing
the
joyful
feeling
of
a
boy
escaping
from
school
began
to
talk
to
his
driver
.
the
man
told
him
that
arms
were
being
dis
tributed
today
at
the
krdmlin
and
that
tomor
row
everyone
would
be
sent
out
beyond
the
three
hills
gates
and
a
great
battle
would
be
fought
there
.
having
reached
the
patriarchs
ponds
pierre
found
the
bazddevs
house
where
he
had
not
been
for
a
long
time
past
.
he
went
up
to
the
gate
.
gerasim
that
sallow
beardless
old
man
pierre
had
seen
at
torzh6k
five
years
before
with
joseph
badcev
came
out
in
answer
to
his
knock
.
at
home
asked
pierre
.
owing
to
the
present
state
of
things
sophia
danilovna
has
gone
to
thetorzhok
estate
with
the
children
your
excellency
.
i
will
come
in
all
the
same
i
have
to
look
through
the
books
said
pierre
.
be
so
good
as
to
step
in
.
makar
alexevich
the
brother
of
my
late
master
may
the
king
dom
of
heaven
be
his
has
remained
here
but
he
is
in
a
weak
state
as
you
know
said
the
old
servant
.
pierre
knew
that
makar
alexevich
was
joseph
bazddevs
halfinsane
brother
and
a
hard
drinker
.
yes
yes
i
know
.
let
us
go
in

.

.

.
said
pierre
and
entered
the
house
.
a
tall
baldheaded
old
man
with
a
red
nose
wearing
a
dressing
gown
and
with
galoshes
on
his
bare
feet
stood
in
the
anteroom
.
on
seeing
pierre
he
muttered
something
angrily
and
went
away
along
the
passage
.
book
eleven
he
was
a
very
clever
man
but
has
now
grown
quite
feeble
as
your
honor
sees
said
gerasim
.
will
you
step
into
the
study
pierre
nodded
.
as
it
was
sealed
up
so
it
has
remained
but
sophia
danilovna
gave
orders
that
if
any
one
should
come
from
you
they
were
to
have
the
books
.
pierre
went
into
that
gloomy
study
which
he
had
entered
with
such
trepidation
in
his
bene
factors
lifetime
.
the
room
dusty
and
un
touched
since
the
death
of
joseph
bazdev
was
now
even
gloomier
.
gerdsim
opened
one
of
the
shutters
and
left
the
room
on
tiptoe
.
pierre
went
round
the
study
approached
the
cupboard
in
which
the
manuscripts
were
kept
and
took
out
what
had
once
been
one
of
the
most
important
the
holy
of
holies
of
the
order
.
this
was
the
authentic
scotch
acts
with
bazdevs
notes
and
explana
tion
..
he
sat
down
at
the
dusty
writing
table
and
having
laid
the
manuscripts
before
him
opened
them
out
closed
them
finally
pushed
them
away
and
resting
his
head
on
his
hand
sank
into
meditation
.
gerdsim
looked
cautiously
into
the
study
several
times
and
saw
pierre
always
sitting
in
the
same
attitude
.
more
than
two
hours
passed
and
gerasim
took
the
liberty
of
making
a
slight
noise
at
the
door
to
attract
his
attention
but
pierre
did
not
hear
him
.
is
the
cabman
to
be
discharged
your
hon
or
oh
yes
said
pierre
rousing
himself
and
rising
hurriedly
.
look
here
he
added
tak
ing
gerasim
by
a
button
of
his
coat
and
look
ing
down
at
the
old
man
with
moist
shining
and
ecstatic
eyes
i
say
do
you
know
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
battle
tomorrow
we
heard
so
replied
the
man
.
i
beg
you
not
to
tell
anyone
who
i
am
and
to
do
what
i
ask
you
.
yes
your
excellency
replied
gerasim
.
will
you
have
something
to
eat
no
but
i
want
something
else
.
i
want
peas
ant
clothes
and
a
pistol
said
pierre
unex
pectedly
blushing
.
yes
your
excellency
said
gcrdsim
after
thinking
for
a
moment
.
all
the
rest
of
that
day
pierre
spent
alone
in
his
benefactors
study
and
gerasim
heard
him
pacing
restlessly
from
one
corner
to
another
and
talking
to
himself
.
and
he
spent
the
night
on
a
bed
made
up
for
him
there
.
gerasim
being
a
servant
who
in
his
time
had
seen
many
strange
things
accepted
pierres
497
taking
up
his
residence
in
the
house
without
surprise
and
seemed
pleased
to
have
someone
to
wait
on
.
that
same
eveningwithout
even
asking
himself
what
they
were
wanted
for
he
procured
a
coachmans
coat
and
cap
for
pierre
and
promised
to
get
him
the
pistol
next
day
.
makar
alexevich
came
twice
that
evening
shuffling
along
in
his
galoshes
as
far
as
the
door
and
stopped
and
looked
ingratiatingly
at
pierre
.
but
as
soon
as
pierre
turned
toward
him
he
wrapped
his
dressing
gown
around
him
with
a
shamefaced
and
angry
look
and
hurried
away
.
it
was
when
pierre
wearing
the
coach
mans
coat
which
gerdsim
had
procured
for
him
and
had
disinfected
by
steam
was
on
his
way
with
the
old
man
to
buy
the
pistol
at
the
siikharev
market
that
he
met
the
rost6vs
.
chapter

kutuzovs
order
to
retreat
through
moscow
to
the
ryazan
road
was
issued
at
night
on
the
first
of
september
.
the
first
troops
started
at
once
and
during
the
night
they
marched
slowly
and
steadily
without
hurry
.
at
daybreak
however
those
nearing
the
town
at
the
dorogomilov
bridge
saw
ahead
of
them
masses
of
soldiers
crowding
and
hurrying
across
the
bridge
ascending
on
the
opposite
side
and
blocking
the
streets
and
alleys
while
endless
masses
of
troops
were
bear
ing
down
on
them
from
behind
and
an
un
reasoning
hurry
and
alarm
overcame
them
.
they
all
rushed
forward
to
the
bridge
onto
it
and
to
the
fords
and
the
boats
.
kutiizov
himself
had
driven
round
by
side
streets
to
the
other
side
of
moscow
.
by
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
of
the
second
of
september
only
the
rearguard
remained
in
the
dorogomilov
suburb
where
they
had
am
ple
room
.
the
main
army
was
on
the
other
side
of
moscow
or
beyond
it
.
at
that
very
time
at
ten
in
the
morning
of
the
second
of
september
napoleon
was
stand
ing
among
his
troops
on
the
pokl6nny
hill
looking
at
the
panorama
spread
out
before
him
.
from
the
twentysixth
of
august
to
the
second
of
september
that
is
from
the
battle
of
borodinti
to
the
entry
of
the
french
into
mos
cow
during
the
whole
of
that
agitating
mem
orable
week
there
had
been
the
extraordi
nary
autumn
weather
that
always
comes
as
a
surprise
when
the
sun
hangs
low
and
gives
more
heat
than
in
spring
when
everything
shines
so
brightly
in
the
rare
clear
atmosphere
that
the
eyes
smart
when
the
lungs
are
strength
ened
and
refreshed
by
inhaling
the
aromatic

war
and
peace
autumn
air
when
even
the
nights
are
warm
and
when
in
those
dark
warm
nights
golden
stars
startle
and
delight
us
continually
by
fall
ing
from
the
sky
.
at
ten
in
the
morning
of
the
second
of
sep
tember
this
weather
still
held
.
the
brightness
of
the
morning
was
magical
.
moscow
seen
from
the
pokl6nny
hill
lay
spa
ciously
spread
out
with
her
river
her
gardens
and
her
churches
and
she
seemed
to
be
living
her
usual
life
her
cupolas
glittering
like
stars
in
the
sunlight
.
the
view
of
the
strange
city
with
its
pecul
iar
architecture
such
as
he
had
never
seen
be
fore
filled
napoleon
with
the
rather
envious
and
uneasy
curiosity
men
feel
when
they
see
an
alien
form
of
life
that
has
no
knowledge
of
them
.
this
city
was
evidently
living
with
the
full
force
of
its
own
life
.
by
the
indefinite
signs
which
even
at
a
distance
distinguish
a
living
body
from
a
dead
one
napoleon
from
the
po
k6nny
hill
perceived
the
throb
of
life
in
the
town
and
felt
as
it
were
the
breathing
of
that
great
and
beautiful
body
.
every
russian
looking
at
moscow
feels
her
to
be
a
mother
every
foreigner
who
sees
her
even
if
ignorant
of
her
significance
as
the
mother
city
must
feel
her
feminine
character
and
napoleon
felt
it
.

dismounting
he
ordered

to

out

from

point

he
gazed
at
the
oriental

it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
his
longfelt
wish
which
had
seemed
unattainable

at

been

in

at

two

napoleon
had
lunched
and
was
again
standing
in
the
same
place
on
the
pokl6nny
hill
awaiting
the
deputation
.
his
speech
to
the
boyars
had
already
taken
definite
shape
in
his
imagination
.
that
speech
was
full
of
dignity
and
greatness
as
napoleon
understood
it
.
he
was
himself
carried
away
by
the
tone
of
magnanimity
he
intended
to
adopt
toward
moscow
.
in
his
imagination
he
appointed
days
for
assemblies
at
the
palace
of
the
tsars
at
which
russian
notables
and
his
own
would
mingle
.
he
mentally
appointed

who
would
win

hearts
of

were

he
mentally
de

that

he
thought
that

he
had
to

in

why
is
the
deputation
from
the
city
so
long
in
appearing
he
wondered
.
meanwhile
an
agitated
consultation
was
be
ing
carried
on
in
whispers
among
his
generals
and
marshals
at
the
rear
of
his
suite
.
those
sent
to
fetch
the
deputation
had
returned
with
the
news
that
moscow
was
empty
that
every
one
had
left
it
.
the
faces
of
those
who
were
not
conferring
together
were
pale
and
per
turbed
.
they
were
not
alarmed
by
the
fact
that
moscow
had
been
abandoned
by
its
inhabi
tants
grave
as
that
fact
seemed
but
by
the
question
how
to
tell
the
emperor
without
putting
him
in
the
terrible
position
of
appear
ing
ridiculous
that
he
had
been
awaiting
the
boyars
so
long
in
vain
that
there
were
drunk
en
mobs
left
in
moscow
but
no
one
else
.
some
said
that
a
deputation
of
some
sort
must
be
scraped
together
others
disputed
that
opinion
and
maintained
that
the
emperor
should
first
be
carefully
and
skillfully
prepared
and
then
told
the
truth
.
he
will
have
to
be
told

the

of

meanwhile
moscow
was
empty
.
there
were
still
people
in
it
perhaps
a
fiftieth
part
of
its
former
inhabitants
had
remained
but
it
was
empty
.
it
was
empty
in
the
sense
that
a
dying
queenless
hive
is
empty
.
in
a
queenless
hive
no
life
is
left
though
to
a
superficial
glance
it
seems
as
much
alive
as
other
hives
.
the
bees
circle
round
a
queenless
hive
in
the
hot
beams
of
the
midday
sun
as
gaily
as
around
the

hives
from
a
distance
it
smells
of
honey
like
the
others
and
bees
fly
in
and
out
in
the
same
way
.
but
one
has
only
to
observe
that
hive
to
realize
that
there
is
no
longer
any
life
in
it
.
the
bees
do
not
fly
in
the
same
way
the
smell
and
the
sound
that
meet
the
beekeeper
are
not
the

with
their
ab

threateningly

ducing
by
the

vibration
of
their

an
aerial

sound
the
only
reply
is
a
dis
connected
buzzing
from
different
parts
of
the
deserted
hive
.
from
the
alighting
board
in
stead
of
the
former
spirituous
fragrant
smell
of
honey
and
venom
and
the
warm
whiffs
of
crowded
life
comes
an
odor
of
emptiness
and
decay
mingling
with
the
smell
of
honey
.
there
are
no
longer
sentinels
sounding
the
alarm
with
their
abdomens
raised
and
ready
to
die
in
defense
of
the
hive
.
there
is
no
longer
the
measured
quiet
sound
of
throbbing
activity
like
the
sound
of
boiling
water

diverse
discordant
sounds
of
disorder

the

the
greatest
crush
during

took

at

come
inside
your
honor
repeated
the
first
tradesman
bowing
.
the
officer
stood
perplexed
and
his
face
showed
indecision
.
its
not
my
business
he
exclaimed
and
strode
on
quickly
down
one
of
the
passages
.
from
one
open
shop
came
the
sound
of
blows
and
vituperation
and
just
as
the
officer
came
up
to
it
a
man
in
a
gray
coat
with
a
shav
en
head
was
flung
out
violently
.
this
man
bent
double
rushed
past
the
tradesman
and
the
officer
.
the
officer
pounced
on
the
soldiers
who
were
in
the
shops
but
at
that
moment
fearful
screams
reached
them
from
the
huge
crowd
on
the
moskvi
bridge
and
the
officer
ran
out
into
the
square
.
what
is
it
what
is
it
he
asked
but
his
comrade
was
already
galloping
off
past
vasili
the
beatified
in
the
direction
from
which
the
screams
carne
.
the
officer
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
aft
er
him
.
when
he
reached
the
bridge
he
saw
two
unlhnbered
guns
the
infantry
crossing
the
bridge
several
overturned
carts
and
fright
ened
and
laughing
faces
among
the
troops
.
be
side
the
cannon
a
cart
was
standing
to
which
two
horses
were
harnessed
.
four
borzois
with
collars
were
pressing
close
to
the
wheels
.
the
cart
was
loaded
high
and
at
the
very
top
be
side
a
childs
chair
with
its
legs
in
the
air
sat
a
peasant
woman
uttering
piercing
and
des
perate
shrieks
.
he
was
told
by
his
fellow
officers
that
the
screams
of
the
crowd
and
the
shrieks
of
the
woman
were
due
to
the
fact
that
general
erm61ov
coming
up
to
the
crowd
and
learning
that
soldiers
were
dispersing
among
the
shops
while
crowds
of
civilians
blocked
the
bridge
had
ordered
two
guns
to
be
unlimbered
and
made
a
show
of
firing
at
the
bridge
.
the
crowd
crushing
one
another
upsetting
carts
and
502
shouting
and
squeezing
desperately
had
cleared
off
the
bridge
and
the
troops
were
now
moving
forward
.
chapter
xxii
meanwhile
the
city
itself
was
deserted
.
there
was
hardly
anyone
in
the
streets
.
the
gates
and
shops
were
all
closed
only
here
and
there
round
the
taverns
solitary
shouts
or
drunken
songs
could
be
heard
.
nobody
drove
through
the
streets
and
footsteps
were
rarely
heard
.
the
povarskdya
was
quite
still
and
deserted
.
the
huge
courtyard
of
the
rosttws
house
was
littered
with
wisps
of
hay
and
with
dung
from
the
horses
and
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
there
.
in
the
great
drawing
room
of
the
house
which
had
been
left
with
all
it
contained
were
two
people
.
they
were
the
yard
porter
ignat
and
the
pageboy
mishka
vasilichs
grandson
who
had
stayed
in
moscow
with
his
grandfather
.
mishka
had
opened
the
clavichord
and
was
strumming
on
it
with
one
finger
.
the
yard
porter
his
arms
akimbo
stood
smiling
with
satisfaction
before
the
large
mirror
.
isnt
it
fine
eh
uncle
ignat
said
the
boy
suddenly
beginning
to
strike
the
keyboard
with
both
hands
.
only
fancy
answered
ignat
surprised
at
the
broadening
grin
on
his
face
in
the
mirror
.
impudence
impudence
they
heard
be
hind
them
the
voice
of
mavra
kuzmfnichna
who
had
entered
silently
.
how
hes
grinning
the
fat
mug
is
that
what
youre
here
for
nothings
cleared
away
down
there
and
vasi
lich

worn
out
.
just
you
wait
a
bit
ignat
left
off
smiling
adjusted
his
belt
and
went
out
of
the
room
with
meekly
downcast
eyes
.
aunt

gently
said
the
boy
.

cried
mdvra
kuzminichna
raising
her
arm
threateningly
.
go
and
get
the
samovar
to
boil
for
your
grandfather
.
mdvra
kuzmfnichna
flicked
the
dust
off
the
clavichord
and
closed
it
and
with
a
deep
sigh
left
the
drawing
room
and
locked
its
main
door
.
going
out
into
the
yard
she
paused
to
con
sider
where
she
should
go
next
to
drink
tea
in
the
servants
wing
with
vasflich
or
into
the
storeroom
to
put
away
what
still
lay
about
.
she
heard
the
sound
of
quick
footsteps
in
the
quiet
street
.
someone
stopped
at
the
gate
and
the
latch
rattled
as
someone
tried
to
open
it
.
mavra
kuzminichna
went
to
the
gate
.
who
do

and
who

see

came
the
reply
in
a
pleasant
wellbred
russian
voice
.
mavra
kuzmfnichna
opened
the
gate
and
an
officer
of
eighteen
with
the
round
face
of
a
rost6v
entered
the
yard
.
they
have
gone
away
sir
.
went
away
yes
terday
at
vespertime
said
mdvra
kuzminich
na
cordially
.
the
young
officer
standing
in
the
gateway
as
if
hesitating
whether
to
enter
or
not
clicked
his
tongue
.
ah
how
annoying
he
muttered
.
i
should
have
come
yesterday
ah
what
a
pity
.
meanwhile
mdvra
kuzminichna
was
atten
tively
and
sympathetically
examining
the
fa
miliar
rost6v
features
of
tlie
young
mans
face
his
tattered
coat
and
troddendown
boots
.
what
did
you
want
to
see
the
count
for
she
asked
.
oh
well

..
.
it
cant
be
helped
said
he
in
a
tone
of
vexation
and
placed
his
hand
on
the
gate
as
if
to
leave
.
he
again
paused
in
indecision
.
you
see
he
suddenly
said
i
am
a
kins
man
of
the
counts
and
he
has
been
very
kind
to
me
.
as
you
see
he
glanced
with
an
amused
air
and
goodnatured
smile
at
his
coat
and
boots
my
things
are
worn
out
and
i
have
no
money
so
i
was
going
to
ask
the
count

.

.

.
mdvra
kuzmfnichna
did
not
let
him
finish
.
just
wait
a
minute
sir
.
one
little
moment
said
she
.
and
as
soon
as
the
officer
let
go
of
the
gate
handle
she
turned
and
hurrying
away
on
her
old
legs
went
through
the
back
yard
to
the
servants
quarters
.
while
mdvra
kuzmfnichna
was
running
to
her
room
the
officer
walked
about
the
yard
gaz
ing
at
his
wornout
boots
with
lowered
head
and
a
faint
smile
on
his
lips
.
what
a
pity
ive
missed
uncle
what
a
nice
old
woman
where
has
she
run
off
to
and
how
am
i
to
find
the
nearest
way
to
overtake
my
regiment
which
must
by
now
be
getting
near
the
rog6zhski
gate
thought
he
.
just
then
mdvra
kuzmi
nichna
appeared
from
behind
the
corner
of
the
house
with
a
frightened
yet
resolute
look
carrying
a
rolledup
check
kerchief
in
her
hand
.
while
still
a
few
steps
from
the
officer
she
unfolded
the
kerchief
and
took
out
of
it
a
white
twenty
fiveruble
assignat
and
hastily
handed
it
to
him
.
if
his
excellency
had
been
at
home
as
a
book
eleven
kinsman
he
would
of
course

.

.

.
but
as
it
is

.

.

.
mdvra
kuzminichna
grew
abashed
and
con
fused
.
the
officer
did
not
decline
but
took
the
note
quietly
and
thanked
her
.
if
the
count
had
been
at
home

.

.

.
ma
vra
kuzmfnichna
went
on
apologetically
.
christ
be
with
you
sir
may
god
preserve
you
said
she
bowing
as
she
saw
him
out
.
swaying
his
head
and
smiling
as
if
amused
at
himself
the
officer
ran
almost
at
a
trot
through
the
deserted
streets
toward
the
yauza
bridge
to
overtake
his
regiment
.
but
ma
vra
kuzminichna
stood
at
the
closed
gate
for
some
time
with
moist
eyes
pensively
swaying
her
head
and
feeling
an
unexpected
flow
of
motherly
tenderness
and
pity
for
the
unknown
young
officer
.

chapter
xxiii
from
an
unfinished
house
on
the
varvdrka
the
ground
floor
of
which
was
a
dramshop
came
drunken
shouts
and
songs
.
on
benches
round
the
tables
in
a
dirty
little
room
sat
some
ten
factory
hands
.
tipsy
and
perspiring
with
dim
eyes
and
wideopen
mouths
they
were
all
laboriously
singing
some
song
or
other
.
they
were
singing
discordantly
arduously
and
with
great
effort
evidently
not
because
they
wished
to
sing
but
because
they
wanted
to
show
they
were
drunk
and
on
a
spree
.
one
a
tall
fair
haired
lad
in
a
clean
blue
coat
was
standing
over
the
others
.
his
face
with
its
fine
straight
nose
would
have
been
handsome
had
it
not
been
for
his
thin
compressed
twitching
lips
and
dull
gloomy
fixed
eyes
.
evidently
pos
sessed
by
some
idea
he
stood
over
those
who
were
singing
and
solemnly
and
jerkily
flour
ished
above
their
heads
his
white
arm
with
the
sleeve
turned
up
to
the
elbow
trying
unnatu
rally
to
spread
out
his
dirty
fingers
.
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
kept
slipping
down
and
he
always
carefully
rolled
it
up
again
with
his
left
hand
as
if
it
were
most
important
that
the
sinewy
white
arm
he
was
flourishing
should
be
bare
.
in
the
midst
of
the
song
cries
were
heard
and
fighting
and
blows
in
the
passage
and
porch
.
the
tall
lad
waved
his
arm
.
stop
it
he
exclaimed
peremptorily
.
theres
a
fight
lads
and
still
rolling
up
his
sleeve
he
went
out
to
the
porch
.
the
factory
hands
followed
him
.
these
men
who
under
the
leadership
of
the
tall
lad
were
drinking
in
the
dramshop
that
morning
had
brought
the
publican
some
skins
from
the
factory
and
for
this
had
had
drink
served
them
.
the
blacksmiths
from
a
neighboring
smithy
hearing
the
sounds
of
revelry
in
the
tavern

.
and
supposing
it
to
have
been
broken
into
wished
to
force
their
way
in
too
and
a
fight
in
the
porch
had
resulted
.
the
publican
was
fighting
one
of
the
smiths
at
the
door
and
when
the
workmen
came
out
the
smith
wrenching
himself
free
from
the
tavernkecper
fell
face
downward
on
the
pave
ment
.
another
smith
tried
to
enter
the
doorway
pressing
against
the
publican
with
his
chest
.
the
lad
with
the
turnedup
sleeve
gave
the
smith
a
blow
in
the
face
and
cried
wildly
theyre
fighting
us
lads
at
that
moment
the
first
smith
got
up
and
scratching
his
bruised
face
to
make
it
bleed
shouted
in
a
tearful
voice
police
murder

.

.

.
theyve
killed
a
man
lads
oh
gracious
me
a
man
beaten
to
death
killed

.

.

.
screamed
a
woman
coming
out
of
a
gate
close
by
.
a
crowd
gathered
round
the
bloodstained
smith
.
havent
you
robbed
people
enough
tak
ing
their
last
shirts
said
a
voice
addressing
the
publican
.
what
have
you
killed
a
man
for
you
thief
the
tall
lad
standing
in
the
porch
turned
his
bleared
eyes
from
the
publican
to
the
smith
and
back
again
as
if
considering
whom
he
ought
to
fight
now
.
murderer
he
shouted
suddenly
to
the
publican
.
bind
him
lads
i
daresay
you
would
like
to
bind
me
shouted
the
publican
pushing
away
the
men
advancing
on
him
and
snatching
his
cap
from
his
head
he
flung
it
on
the
ground
.
as
if
this
action
had
some
mysterious
and
menacing
significance
the
workmen
surround
ing
the
publican
paused
in
indecision
.
i
know
the
law
very
well
mates
ill
take
the
matter
to
the
captain
of
police
.
you
think
i
wont
get
to
him
robbery
is
not
permitted
to
anybody
nowadays
shouted
the
publican
picking
up
his
cap
.
come
along
then
come
along
then
the
publican
and
the
tall
young
fellow
repeated
one
after
the
other
and
they
moved
up
the
street
together
.
the
bloodstained
smith
went
beside
them
.
the
factory
hands
and
others
followed
be
hind
talking
and
shouting
.
at
the
corner
of
the
moroseyka
opposite
a
large
house
with
closed
shutters
and
bearing
a
bootmakers
signboard
stood
a
score
of
thin
wornout
gloomyfaced
bootmakers
wearing
war
and
peace
overalls
and
long
tattered
coats
.
he
should
pay
folks
off
properly
a
thin
workingman
with
frowning
brows
and
a
straggly
beard
was
saying
.
but
hes
sucked
our
blood
and
now
he
thinks
hes
quit
of
us
.
hes
been
misleading
us
all
the
week
and
now
that
hes
brought
us
to
this
pass
hes
made
off
.
on
seeing
the
crowd
and
the
bloodstained
man
the
workman
ceased
speaking
and
with
eager
curiosity
all
the
bootmakers
joined
the
moving
crowd
.
where
are
all
the
folks
going
why
to
the
police
of
course
i
say
is
it
true
that
we
have
been
beaten
and
what
did
you
think
look
what
folks
are
saying
.
questions
and
answers
were
heard
.
the
pub
lican
taking
advantage
of
the
increased
crowd
dropped
behind
and
returned
to
his
tavern
.
the
tall
youth
not
noticing
the
disappear
ance
of
his
foe
waved
his
bare
arm
and
went
on
talking
incessantly
attracting
general
at
tention
to
himself
.
it
was
around
him
that
the
people
chiefly
crowded
expecting
answers
from
him
to
the
questions
that
occupied
all
their
minds
.
he
must
keep
order
keep
the
law
thats
what
the
government
is
there
for
.
am
i
not
right
good
christians
said
the
tall
youth
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
.
he
thinks
theres
no
government
how
can
one
do
with
out
government
or
else
there
would
be
plenty
whod
rob
us
.
why
talk
nonsense
rejoined
voices
in
the
crowd
.
will

give
up
moscow
like
this
they
told
you
that
for
fun
and
you
believed
it
arent
there
plenty
of
troops
on
the
march
let
him
in
indeed
thats
what
the
govern
ment
is
for
.
youd
better
listen
to
what
people
are
saying
said
some
of
the
mob
pointing
to
the
tall
youth
.
by
the
wall
of
chinatown
a
smaller
group
of
people
were
gathered
round
a
man
in
a
frieze
coat
who
held
a
paper
in
his
hand
.
an
ukase
they
are
reading
an
ukdsel
read
ing
an
ukise
cried
voices
in
the
crowd
and
the
people
rushed
toward
the
reader
.
the
man
in
the
frieze
coat
was
reading
the
broadsheet
of
august
31
.
when
the
crowd
col
lected
round
him
he
seemed
confused
but
at
the
demand
of
the
tall
lad
who
had
pushed
his
way
up
to
him
he
began
in
a
rather
tremulous
voice
to
read
the
sheet
from
the
beginning
.
early
tomorrow
i
shall
go
to
his
serene
highness
he
read
sirin
highness
said
the
tall
fellow
with
a
triumphant
smile
on
his
lips
and
a
frown
on
his
brow
to
consult
with
him
to
act
and
to
aid
the
army
to
exterminate
these
scoundrels
.
we
too
will
take
part

.

.

.
the
reader
went
on
and
then
paused
do
you
see
shouted
the
youth
victoriously
hes
going
to
clear
up
the
whole
affair
for
you

in
destroying
them
and
will
send
these
visi
tors
to
the
devil
.
i
will
come
back
to
dinner
and
well
set
to
work
.
we
will
do
completely
do
and
undo
these
scoundrels
.
the
last
words
were
read
out
in
the
midst
of
complete
silence
.
the
tall
lad
hung
his
head
gloomily
.
it
was
evident
that
no
one
had
un
derstood
the
last
part
.
in
particular
the
words
i
will
come
back
to
dinner
evidently
dis
pleased
both
reader
and
audience
.
the
peo
ples
minds
were
tuned
to
a
high
pitch
and
this
was
too
simple
and
needlessly
comprehen
sibleit
was
what
any
one
of
them
might
have
said
and
therefore
was

chapter
xxiv
on
the
evening
of
the
first
of
september
after
his
interview
with
kutuzov
count
rostopchin
had
returned
to
moscow
mortified
and
of
fended
because
he
had
not
been
invited
to
at
tend
the
council
of
war
and
because
kutuzov
had
paid
no
attention
to
his
offer
to
take
part
in
the
defense
of
the
city
amazed
also
at
the
novel
outlook
revealed
to
him
at
the
camp
which
treated
the
tranquillity
of
the
capital
and
its
patriotic
fervor
as
not
merely
secondary
but
quite
irrelevant
and
unimportant
matters
.
distressed
offended
and
surprised
by
all
this
rostopchfn
had
returned
to
moscow
.
after
supper
he
lay
down
on
a
sofa
without
undress
ing
and
was
awakened
soon
after
midnight
by
a
courier
bringing
him
a
letter
from
kutu
zov
.
this
letter
requested
the
count
to
send
police
officers
to
guide
the
troops
through
the
town
as
the
army
was
retreating
to
the
ryazan
road
beyond
moscow
.
this
was
not
news
to
rostopchin
.
he
had
known
that
moscow
would
be
abandoned
not
merely
since
his
in
terview
the
previous
day
with
kutuzov
on
the
pokl6nny
hill
but
ever
since
the
battle
of
borodin6
for
all
the
generals
who
came
to
moscow
after
that
battle
had
said
unanimously
that
it
was
impossible
to
fight
another
battle
and
since
then
the
government
property
had
been
removed
every
night
and
half
the
inhabi
tants
had
left
the
city
with
rostopchfns
own
permission
.
yet
all
the
same
this
information
astonished
and
irritated
the
count
coming
as
it
did
in
the
form
of
a
simple
note
with
an
or
der
from
kutuzov
and
received
at
night
break
ing
in
on
his
beauty
sleep
.
when
later
on
in
his
memoirs
count
ros
topchin
explained
his
actions
at
this
time
he
repeatedly
says
that
he
was
then
actuated
by
two
important
considerations
to
maintain
tranquillity
in
moscow
and
expedite
the
de
parture
of
the
inhabitants
.
if
one
accepts
this
twofold
aim
all
rostopchfns
actions
appear
ir
reproachable
.
why
were
the
holy
relics
the
arms
ammunition
gunpowder
and
stores
of
corn
not
removed
why
were
thousands
of
in
habitants
deceived
into
believing
that
moscow
would
not
be
given
up
and
thereby
ruined
to
preserve
the
tranquillity
of
the
city
ex
plains
count
rostopchin
.
why
were
bundles
of
useless
papers
from
the
government
offices
and
leppichs
balloon
and
other
articles
re
moved
to
leave
the
town
empty
explains
count
rostopchin
.
one
need
only
admit
that
public
tranquillity
is
in
danger
and
any
action
finds
a
justification
.
all
the
horrors
of
the
reign
of
terror
were
based
only
on
solicitude
for
public
tranquil
lity
.
on
what
then
was
count
rostopchfns
fear
for
the
tranquillity
of
moscow
based
in
1812
what
reason
was
there
for
assuming
any
prob
ability
of
an
uprising
in
the
city
the
inhabi
tants
were
leaving
it
and
the
retreating
troops
were
filling
it
.
why
should
that
cause
the
masses
to
riot
neither
in
moscow
nor
anywhere
in
russia
did
anything
resembling
an
insurrection
ever
occur
when
the
enemy
entered
a
town
.
more
than
ten
thousand
people
were
still
in
moscow
on
the
first
and
second
of
september
and
except
for
a
mob
in
the
governors
courtyard
assem
bled
there
at
his
bidding
nothing
happened
.
it
is
obvious
that
there
would
have
been
even
less
reason
to
expect
a
disturbance
among
the
people
if
after
the
battle
of
borodin6
when
the
surrender
of
moscow
became
certain
or
at
least
probable
rostopchin
instead
of
exciting
the
people
by
distributing
arms
and
broad
sheets
had
taken
steps
to
remove
all
the
holy
relics
the
gunpowder
munitions
and
money
and
had
told
the
population
plainly
that
the
town
would
be
abandoned
.
rostopchin
though
he
had
patriotic
senti
ments
was
a
sanguine
and
impulsive
man
who
had
always
moved
in
the
highest
administra
tive
circles
and
had
no
understanding
at
all
of
the
people
he
supposed
himself
to
be
guiding
.
ever
since
the
enemys
entry
into
smolensk
he
had
in
imagination
been
playing
the
role
of
director
of
the
popular
feeling
of
the
heart
of
russia
.
not
only
did
it
seem
to
him
as
to
all
administrators
that
he
controlled
the
external
actions
of
moscows
inhabitants
but
he
also
war
and
peace
thought
he
controlled
their
mental
attitude
by
means
of
his
broadsheets
and
posters
written
in
a
coarse
tone
which
the
people
despise
in
their
own
class
and
do
not
understand
from
those
in
authority
.
rostopchfn
was
so
pleased
with
the
fine
role
of
leader
of
popular
feeling
and
had
grown
so
used
to
it
that
the
necessity
of
relinquishing
that
role
and
abandoning
moscow
without
any
heroic
display
took
him
unawares
and
he
suddenly
felt
the
ground
slip
away
from
under
his
feet
so
that
he
positively
did
notknow
what
to
do
.
though
he
knew
it
was
coming
he
did
not
till
the
last
moment
wholeheartedly
believe
that
moscow
would
be
abandoned
and
did
not
prepare
for
it
.
the
in
habitants
left
against
his
wishes
.
if
the
govern
ment
offices
were
removed
this
was
only
done
on
the
demand
of
officials
to
whom
the
count
yielded
reluctantly
.
he
was
absorbed
in
the
role
he
had
created
for
himself
.
as
is
often
the
case
with
those
gifted
with
an
ardent
imagina
tion
though
he
had
long
known
that
moscow
would
be
abandoned
he
knew
it
only
with
his
intellect
he
did
not
believe
it
in
his
heart
and
did
not
adapt
himself
mentally
to
this
new
position
of
affairs
.
all
his
painstaking
and
energetic
activity
in
how
far
it
was
useful
and
had
any
effect
on
the
people
is
another
question
had
been
sim
ply
directed
toward
arousing
in
the
masses
his
own
feeling
of
patriotic
hatred
of
the
french
.
but
when
events
assumed
their
true
histori
cal
character
when
expressing
hatred
for
the
french
in
words
proved
insufficient
when
it
was
not
even
possible
to
express
that
hatred
by
fighting
a
battle
when
selfconfidence
was
of
no
avail
in
relation
to
the
one
question
before
moscow
when
the
whole
population
streamed
out
of
moscow
as
one
man
abandoning
their
belongings
and
proving
by
that
negative
ac
tion
all
the
depth
of
their
national
feeling
then
the
role
chosen
by
rostopchin
suddenly
appeared
senseless
.
he
unexpectedly
felt
him
self
ridiculous
weak
and
alone
with
no
ground
to
stand
on
.
when
awakened
from
his
sleep
he
received
that
cold
peremptory
note
from
kutiizov
he
felt
the
more
irritated
the
more
he
felt
himself
to
blame
.
all
that
he
had
been
specially
put
in
charge
of
the
state
property
which
he
should
have
removed
was
still
in
moscow
and
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
take
the
whole
of
it
away
.
who
is
to
blame
for
it
who
has
let
things
come
to
such
a
pass
he
ruminated
.
not
i
of
course
.
i
had
everything
ready
.
i
had
mos
cow
firmly
in
hand
.
and
this
is
what
they
have
let
it
come
to
villains
traitors
he
thought
without
clearly
defining
who
the
villains
and
traitors
were
but
feeling
it
necessary
to
hate
those
traitors
whoever
they
might
be
who
were
to
blame
for
the
false
and
ridiculous
position
in
which
he
found
himself
.
all
that
night
count
rostopchfn
issued
or
ders
for
which
people
came
to
him
from
all
parts
of
moscow
.
those
about
him
had
never
seen
the
count
so
morose
and
irritable
.

.

.
all
night
long
such
announcements
were
continually
being
received
by
the
count
.
to
all
these
inquiries
he
gave
brief
and
an
gry
replies
indicating
that
orders
from
him
were
not
now
needed
that
the
whole
affair
carefully
prepared
by
him
had
now
been
ruined
by
somebody
and
that
that
somebody
would
have
to
bear
the
whole
responsibility
for
all
that
might
happen
.
oh

he
said
in
reply
to
the
question
from
the
registrars
depart
ment
that

should
remain

.

bring

to

chapter
xxv
toward
nine
oclock
in
the
morning
when
the
troops
were
already
moving
through
mos
cow
nobody
came
to
the
count
any
more
for
book
eleven
instructions
.
those
who
were
able
to
get
away
were
going
of
their
own
accord
those
who
re
mained
behind
decided
for
themselves
what
they
must
do
.
the
count
ordered
his
carriage
that
he
might
drive
to
sok61niki
and
sat
in
his
study
with
folded
hands
morose
sallow
and
taciturn
.
in
quiet
and
untroubled
times
it
seems
to
every
administrator
that
it
is
only
by
his
ef
forts
that
the
whole
population
under
his
rule
is
kept
going
and
in
this
consciousness
of
be
ing
indispensable
every
administrator
finds
the
chief
reward
of
his
labor
and
efforts
.
while
the
sea
of
history
remains
calm
the
ruleradminis
trator
in
his
frail
bark
holding
on
with
a
boat
hook
to
the
ship
of
the
people
and
himself
moving
naturally
imagines
that
his
efforts
move
the
ship
he
is
holding
on
to
.
but
as
soon
as
a
storm
arises
and
the
sea
begins
to
heave
and
the
ship
to
move
such
a
delusion
is
no
longer
possible
.
the
ship
moves
independent
ly
with
its
own
enormous
motion
the
boat
hook
no
longer
reaches
the
moving
vessel
and
suddenly
the
administrator
instead
of
appear
ing
a
ruler
and
a
source
of
power
becomes
an
insignificant
useless
feeble
man
.
rostopchfn
felt
this
and
it
was
this
which
exasperated
him
.
the
superintendent
of
police
whom
the
crowd
had
stopped
went
in
to
see
him
at
the
same
time
as
an
adjutant
who
informed
the
count
that
the
horses
were
harnessed
.
they
were
both
pale
and
the
superintendent
of
police
after
reporting
that
he
had
executed
the
instructions
he
had
received
informed
the
count
that
an
immense
crowd
had
collected
in
the
courtyard
and
wished
to
see
him
.
without
saying
a
word
rostopchf
n
rose
and
walked
hastily
to
his
light
luxurious
drawing
room
went
to
the
balcony
door
took
hold
of
the
handle
let
it
go
again
and
went
to
the
window
from
which
he
had
a
better
view
of
the
whole
crowd
.
the
tall
lad
was
standing
in
front
flourishing
his
arm
and
saying
some
thing
with
a
stern
look
.
the
bloodstained
smith
stood
beside
him
with
a
gloomy
face
.
a
drone
of
voices
was
audible
through
the
closed
win
dow
.
is
my
carriage
ready
asked
rostopchfn
stepping
back
from
the
window
.
it
is
your
excellency
replied
the
adjutant
.
rostopchfn
went
again
to
the
balcony
door
.
but
what
do
they
want
he
asked
the
su
perintendent
of
police
.
your
excellency
they
say
they
have
got
ready
according
to
your
orders
to
go
against
507
the
french
and
they
shouted
something
about
treachery
.
but
it
is
a
turbulent
crowd
your
excellency
i
hardly
managed
to
get
away
from
it
.
your
excellency
i
venture
to
suggest

.

.

.
you
may
go
.
i
dont
need
you
to
tell
me
what
to
do
exclaimed
rostopchin
angrily
.
he
stood
by
the
balcony
door
looking
at
the
crowd
.
this
is
what
they
have
done
with
russia
this
is
what
they
have
done
with
me
thought
he
full
of
an
irrepressible
fury
that
welled
up
within
him
against
the
someone
to
whom
what
was
happening
might
be
attributed
.
as
often
happens
with
passionate
people
he
was
mas
tered
by
anger
but
was
still
seeking
an
object
on
which
to
vent
it
.
here
is
that
mob
the
dregs
of
the
people
he
thought
as
he
gazed
at
the
crowd
this
rabble
they
have
roused
by
their
folly
they
want
a
victim
he
thought
as
he
looked
at
the
tall
lad
flourishing
his
arm
.
and
this
thought
occurred
to
him
just
because
he
himself
desired
a
victim
something
on
which
to
vent
his
rage
.
is
the
carriage
ready
he
asked
again
.
yes
your
excellency
.
what
are
your
orders
about
vereshchagin
he
is
waiting
at
the
porch
said
the
adjutant
.
ah
exclaimed
rostopchfn
as
if
struck
by
an
unexpected
recollection
.
and
rapidly
opening
the
door
he
went
reso
lutely
out
onto
the
balcony
.
the
talking
in
stantly
ceased
hats
and
caps
were
doffed
and
all
eyes
were
raised
to
the
count
.
good
morning
lads
said
the
count
brisk
ly
and
loudly
.
thank
you
for
coming
.
ill
come
out
to
you
in
a
moment
but
we
must
first
settle
with
the
villain
.
we
must
punish
the
villain
who
has
caused
the
ruin
of
moscow
.
wait
for
me
and
the
count
stepped
as
briskly
back
into
the
room
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
.
a
murmur
of
approbation
and
satisfaction
ran
through
the
crowd
.
hell
settle
with
all
the
villains
youll
seel
and
you
said
the
french

.

.

.
hell
show
you
what
law
is
the
mob
were
saying
as
if
reproving
one
another
for
their
lack
of
confidence
.
a
few
minutes
later
an
officer
came
hurried
ly
out
of
the
front
door
gave
an
order
and
the
dragoons
formed
up
in
line
.
the
crowd
moved
eagerly
from
the
balcony
toward
the
porch
.
rostopchfn
coming
out
there
with
quick
angry
steps
looked
hastily
around
as
if
seeking
someone
.
where
is
he
he
inquired
.
and
as
he
spoke
he
saw
a
young
man
coming
round
the
corner
508
war
and
peace
of
the
house
between
two
dragoons
.
he
had
a
long
thin
neck
and
his
head
that
had
been
half
shaved
was
again
covered
by
short
hair
.
this
young
man
was
dressed
in
a
threadbare
blue
cloth
coat
lined
with
fox
fur
that
had
once
been
smart
and
dirty
hempen
convict
trousers
over
which
were
pulled
his
thin
dirty
troddendown
boots
.
on
his
thin
weak
legs
were
heavy
chains
which
hampered
his
irreso
lute
movements
.
ah
said
rostopchin
hurriedly
turning
away
his
eyes
from
the
young
man
in
the
fur
lined
coat
and
pointing
to
the
bottom
step
of
the
porch
.
put
him
there
.
the
young
man
in
his
clattering
chains
stepped
clumsily
to
the
spot
indicated
hold
ing
away
with
one
finger
the
coat
collar
which
chafed
his
neck
turned
his
long
neck
twice
this
way
and
that
sighed
and
submissively
folded
before
him
his
thin
hands
unused
to
work
.
for
several
seconds
while
the
young
man
was
taking
his
place
on
the
step
the
silence
continued
.
only
among
the
back
rows
of
the
people
who
were
all
pressing
toward
the
one
spot
could
sighs
groans
and
the
shuffling
of
feet
be
heard
.
while
waiting
for
the
young
man
to
take
his
place
on
the
step
rostopchin
stood
frowning
and
rubbing
his
face
with
his
hand
.
lads
said
he
with
a
metallic
ring
in
his
voice
.
this
man
vereshchdgin
is
the
scoun
drel
by
whose
doing
moscow
is
perishing
.
the
young
man
in
the
furlined
coat
stoop
ing
a
little
stood
in
a
submissive
attitude
his
fingers
clasped
before
him
.
his
emaciated
young
face
disfigured
by
the
halfshaven
head
hung
down
hopelessly
.
at
the
counts
first
words
he
raised
it
slowly
and
looked
up
at
him
as
if
wishing
to
say
something
or
at
least
to
meet
his
eye
.
but
rostopchin
did
not
look
at
him
.
a
vein
in
the
young
mans
long
thin
neck
swelled
like
a
cord
and
went
blue
behind
the
ear
and
suddenly
his
face
flushed
.
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
.
he
looked
at
the
crowd
and
rendered
more
hopeful
by
the
expression
he
read
on
the
faces
there
he
smiled
sadly
and
timidly
and
lowering
his
head
shift
ed
his
feet
on
the
step
.
he
has
betrayed
his
tsar
and
his
country
he
had
gone
over
to
bonaparte
.
he
alone
of
all
the
russians
has
disgraced
the
russian
name
he
has
caused
moscow
to
perish
said
rostopchin
in
a
sharp
even
voice
but
sudden
ly
he
glanced
down
at
vereshchagin
who
con
tinued
to
stand
in
the
same
submissive
atti
tude
.
as
if
inflamed
by
the
sight
he
raised
his
arm
and
addressed
the
people
almost
shout
ing
deal
with
him
as
you
think
fit
i
hand
him
over
to
you
.
the
crowd
remained
silent
and
only
pressed
closer
and
closer
to
one
another
.
to
keep
one
another
back
to
breathe
in
that
stifling
atmos
phere
to
be
unable
to
stir
and
to
await
some
thing
unknown
uncomprehendecl
and
terri
ble
was
becoming
unbearable
.
those
stand
ing
in
front
who
had
seen
and
heard
what
had
taken
place
before
them
all
stood
with
wide
open
eyes
and
mouths
straining
with
all
their
strength
and
held
back
the
crowd
that
was
pushing
behind
them
.

hearing
not
so
much
the
words
as
the
angry
tone
of
rostopchins
voice
the
crowd
moaned
and
heaved
forward
but
again
paused
.
count
exclaimed
the
timid
yet
theatrical
voice
of
vereshchdgin
in
the
midst
of
the
mo
mentary
silence
that
ensued
count
one

above
us
both
.

.

.

.
he
lifted
his
head
and
again
the
thick
vein
in
his
thin
neck
filled
with
blood
and
the
color
rapidly
came
and
went
in
his
face
.
he
did
not
finish
what
he
wished
to
say
.
cut

shouted
rostopchfn
suddenly
growing
pale
like
vere

.

cried
the
dragoon
officer
drawing
his
own
.
another
still
stronger
wave
flowed
through
the
crowd
and
reaching
the
front
ranks
carried
it
swaying
to
the
very
steps
of
the
porch
.
the
tall
youth
with
a
stony
look
on
his
face
and
rigid
and
uplifted
arm
stood
beside
veresh
chdgin
.
saber
him
the
dragoon
officer
almost
whispered
.
and
one
of
the
soldiers
his
face
all
at
once
distorted
with
fury
struck
vereshchdgin
on
the
head
with
the
blunt
side
of
his
saber
.
ah
cried
vereshchdgin
in
meek
surprise
looking
round
with
a
frightened
glance
as
if
not
understanding
why
this
was
done
to
him
.
a
similar
moan
of
surprise
and
horror
ran
through
the
crowd
.
o
lord
exclaimed
a
sorrowful
voice
.
but
after
the
exclamation
of
surprise
that
had
escaped
from
vereshchdgin
he
uttered
a
plaintive
cry
of
pain
and
that
cry
was
fatal
.
the
barrier
of
human
feeling
strained
to
the
book
eleven
utmost
that
had
held
the
crowd
in
check
sud
denly
broke
.
the
crime
had
begun
and
must
now
be
completed
.
the
plaintive
moan
of
re
proach
was
drowned
by
the
threatening
and
angry
roar
of
the
crowd
.
like
the
seventh
and
last
wave
that
shatters
a
ship
that
last
irresisti
ble
wave
burst
from
the
rear
and
reached
the
front
ranks
carrying
them
of
their
feet
and
engulfing
them
all
.
the
dragoon
was
about
to
repeat
his
blow
.
vereshchagin
with
a
cry
of
horror
covering
his
head
with
his
hands
rushed
toward
the
crowd
.
the
tall
youth
against
whom
he
stumbled
seized
his
thin
neck
with
his
hands
and
yelling
wildly
fell
with
him
un
der
the
feet
of
the
pressing
struggling
crowd
.
some
beat
and
tore
at
vcreshcndgin
others
at
the
tall
youth
.
and
the
screams
of
those
that
were
being
trampled
on
and
of
those
who
tried
to
rescue
the
tall
lad
only
increased
the
fury
of
the
crowd
.
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
dragoons
could
extricate
the
bleeding
youth
beaten
almost
to
death
.
and
for
a
long
time
despite
the
feverish
haste
with
which
the
mob
tried
to
end
the
work
that
had
been
be
gun
those
who
were
hitting
throttling
and
tearing
at
vereshchagin
were
unable
to
kill
him
for
the
crowd
pressed
from
all
sides
swaying
as
one
mass
with
them
in
the
center
and
rendering
it
impossible
for
them
either
to
kill
him
or
let

what
still

only
when
the
victim
ceased
to
struggle
and
his
cries
changed
to
a
longdrawn
measured
death
rattle
did
the
crowd
around
his
pros

bleeding
corpse
begin
rapidly
to
change
places
.
each
one
came
up
glanced
at
what
had
been
done
and
with
horror
reproach
and
as
tonishment
pushed
back
again
.
o
lord
the
people
are
like
wild
beasts
how
could
he

voices
in
the
crowd
could
be
heard

.

.
oh
the

arent

afraid

.

.
said
the
same
mob
now
looking
with
pained
distress
at
the
dead
body
with
its
long
thin
halfsevered
neck
and
its
livid
face
stained
with
blood
and
dust
.
a
painstaking
police
officer
considering
the
presence
of
a
corpse
in
his
excellencys
court
yard
unseemly
told
the
dragoons
to
take
it
away
.
two
dragoons
took
it
by
its
distorted
legs
and
dragged
it
along
the
ground
.
the
gory
duststained
halfshaven
head
with
its
long
neck
trailed
twisting
along
the
ground
.
the
crowd
shrank
back
from
it
.
at
the
moment
when
vereshchdgin
fell
and
the
crowd
closed
in
with
savage
yells
and
swayed
about
him
rostopchin
suddenly
turned
pale
and
instead
of
going
to
the
back
entrance
where
his
carriage
awaited
him
went
with
hurried
steps
and
bent
head
not
knowing
where
and
why
along
the
passage
leading
to
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
.
the
counts
face
was
white
and
he
could
not
control
the
feverish
twitching
of
his
lower
jaw
.
this
way
your
excellency

.

.

.
where
are
you
going

.

.

.
this
way
please

.

.

.
said
a
trembling
frightened
voice
behind
him
.
count
rostopchin
was
unable
to
reply
and
turning
obediently
went
in
the
direction
in
dicated
.
at
the
back
entrancestood
his
caliche
.
the
distant
roar
of
the
yelling
crowd
was
audi
ble
even
there
.
he
hastily
took
his
seat
and
told
the
coachman
to
drive
him
to
his
country
house
in
sokolniki
.
when
they
reached
the
myasnitski
street
and
could
no
longer
hear
the
shouts
of
the
mob
the
count
began
to
repent
.
he
remem
bered
with
dissatisfaction
the
agitation
and
fear
he
had
betrayed
before
his
subordinates
.
the
mob
is
terrible
disgusting
he
said
to
himself
in
french
.
they
are
like
wolves
whom
nothing
but
flesh
can
appease
.
count
one
god
is
above
us
both
vereshcha
gins
words
suddenly
recurred
to
him
and
a
disagreeable
shiver
ran
down
his
back
.
but
this
was
only
a
momentary
feeling
and
count
rostopchin
smiled
disdainfully
at
himself
.
i
had
other
duties
thought
he
.
the
people
had
to
be
appeased
.
many
other
victims
have
perished
and
are
perishing
for
the
public
good
and
he
began
thinking
of
his
social
duties
to
his
family
and
to
the
city
entrusted
to
him
and
of
himself
not
himself
as
theodore
vasilye
vich
rostopchin
he
fancied
that
theodore
vasflyevich
rostopchfn
was
sacrificing
him
self
for
the
public
good
but
himself
as
gov
ernor
the
representative
of
authority
and
of
the
tsar
.
had
i
been
simply
theodore
vasfl
yevich
my
course
of
action
would
have
been
quite
different
but
it
was
my
duty
to
safe
guard
my
life
and
dignity
as
commander
in
chief
.
lightly
swaying
on
the
flexible
springs
of
nis
carriage
and
no
longer
hearing
the
terrible
5
io
war
and
peace
sounds
of
the
crowd
rostopchfn
grew
physi
cally
calm
and
as
always
happens
as
soon
as
he
became
physically
tranquil
his
mind
de
vised
reasons
why
he
should
be
mentally
tran
quil
too
.
the
thought
which
tranquillized
ros
topchfn
was
not
a
new
one
.
since
the
world
be
gan
and
men
have
killed
one
another
no
one
has
ever
committed
such
a
crime
against
his
fellow
man
without
comforting
himself
with
this
same
idea
.
this
idea
is
le
bien
public
the
hypothetical
welfare
of
other
people
.
to
a
man
not
swayed
by
passion
that
wel
fare
is
never
certain
but
he
who
commits
such
a
crime
always
knows
just
where
that
welfare
lies
.
and
rostopchin
now
knew
it
.
not
only
did
his
reason
not
reproach
him
for
what
he
had
done
but
he
even
found
cause
for
selfsatisfaction
in
having
so
successfully
contrived
to
avail
himself
of
a
convenient
op
portunity
to
punish
a
criminal
and
at
the
same
time
pacify
the
mob
.
vereshchdgin
was
tried
and
condemned
to
death
thought
rostopchin
though
the
sen
ate
had
only
condemned
vereshchagin
to
hard
labor
he
was
a
traitor
and
a
spy
.
i
could
not
let
him
go
unpunished
and
so
i
have
killed
two
birds
with
one
stone
to
appease
the
mob
i
gave
them
a
victim
and
at
the
same
time
pun
ished
a
miscreant
.
having
reached
his
country
house
and
be
gun
to
give
orders
about
domestic
arrange
ments
the
count
grew
quite
tranquil
.
half
an
hour
later
he
was
driving
with
his
fast
horses
across
the
sok61niki
field
no
longer
thinking
of
what
had
occurred
but
considering
what
was
to
come
.
he
was
driving
to
the
yaiiza
bridge
where
he
had
heard
that
kutuzov
was
.
count
rostopchfn
was
mentally
preparing
the
angry
and
stinging
reproaches
he
meant
to
address
to
kutuzov
for
his
deception
.
he
would
make
that
foxy
old
courtier
feel
that
the
responsibility
for
all
the
calamities
that
would
follow
the
abandonment
of
the
city
and
the
ruin
of
russia
as
rostopchin
regarded
it
would
fall
upon
his
doting
old
head
.
planning
beforehand
what
he
would
say
to
kutuzov
rostopchfn
turned
angrily
in
his
caliche
and
gazed
sternly
from
side
to
side
.
the
sok61niki
field
was
deserted
.
only
at
the
end
of
it
in
front
of
the
almshouse
and
the
lunatic
asylum
could
be
seen
some
people
in
white
and
others
like
them
walking
singly
across
the
field
shouting
and
gesticulating
.
one
of
these
was
running
to
cross
the
path
of
count
rostopchfns
carriage
and
the
count
himself
his
coachman
jnd
his
dragoons
looked
with
vague
horror
and
curiosity
at
these
re
leased
lunatics
and
especially
at
the
one
run
ning
toward
them
.
swaying
from
side
to
side
on
his
long
thin
legs
in
his
fluttering
dressing
gown
this
luna
tic
was
running
impetuously
his
gaze
fixed
on
rostopchin
shouting
something
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
making
signs
to
him
to
stop
.
the
lunatics
solemn
gloomy
face
was
thin
and
yellow
with
its
beard
growing
in
uneven
tufts
.
his
black
agate
pupils
with
saffronyellow
whites
moved
restlessly
near
the
lower
eyelids
.
stop
pull
up
i
tell
you
he
cried
in
a
piercing
voice
and
again
shouted
something
breathlessly
with
emphatic
intonations
and
gestures
.
coming
abreast
of
the
caliche
he
ran
be
side
it
.
thrice

around

a

of

who
had
remained
in

stared

at

went
from
one
to
another
in
the
crowd
.
the
interpreter
addressed
an
old
porter
and
asked
if
it
was
far
to
the

.
the
porter
listening
in
perplexity
to
the
unfamiliar
polish
accent
and
not
realizing
that
the
interpreter
was
speaking

did
not
understand
what
was
being
said
to
him
and
slipped

approached
the
interpreter
and
told
him
to
ask
where
the
russian
army
was
.
one
of
the
russians
understood
what
was
asked
and
several
voices
at
once
began
answering
the
interpreter
.
a
french
officer
returning
from
the
advanced
detachment
rode
up
to
murat
and
reported
that
the
gates
of
the
cita
del
had
been
barricaded
and
that
there
was
probably
an
ambuscade
there
.
good
said
murat
and
turning
to
one
of
the
gentlemen
in
his
suite
ordered
four
light
guns
to
be
moved
forward
to
fire
at
the
gates
.
the
guns
emerged
at
a
trot
from
the
column
following
murat
and
advanced
up
the
arbat
.
when
they
reached
the
end
of
the
vozdvfzhen
ka
street
they
halted
and
drew
up
in
the
square
.
several
french
officers
superintended
the
plac
ing
of
the
guns
and
looked
at
the
kremlin
through
field
glasses
.
the
bells
in
the
kremlin
were
ringing
for
vespers
and
this
sound
troubled
the
french
.
they
imagined
it
to
be
a
call
to
arms
.
a
few
infantrymen
ran
to
the
kutdfyev
gate
.
beams
and
wooden
screens
had
been
put
there
and
two
musket
shots
rang
out
from
under
the
gate
as
soon
as
an
officer
and
men
began
to
run
toward
it
.
a
general
who
was
standing
by
the
guns
shouted
some
words
of
command
to
the
officer
and
the
latter
ran
back
again
with
his
men

.
the
sound
of
three
more
shots
came
from
the
gate
.
one
shot
struck
a
french
soldiers
foot
and
from
behind
the
screens
came
the
strange
sound
of
a
few
voices
shouting
.
instantly
as
at
a
word
of
command
the
expression
of
cheerful
serenity
on
the
faces
of
the
french
general
of
ficers
and
men
changed
to
one
of
determined
concentrated
readiness
for
strife
and
suffering
.
to
all
of
them
from
the
marshal
to
the

familiar
in
moscow
but
a
new
battlefield
which
would
probably
prove
sanguinary
.
and
all
made
ready
for
that
battle
.
the
cries
from
the
gates
ceased
.
the
guns
were
advanced
the
artillerymen
blew
the
ash
off
their
linstocks
and
an
officer
gave
the
word
fire
this
was
followed
by
two
whistling
5
war
and
peace
sounds
of
canister
shot
one
after
another
.
the
shot
rattled
against
the
stone
of
the
gate
and
upon
the
wooden
beams
and
screens
and
two
wavering
clouds
of
smoke
rose
over
the
square
.
a
few
instants
after
the
echo
of
the
reports
resounding
over
the
stonebuilt
kremlin
had
died
away
the
french
heard
a
strange
sound
above
their
head
.
thousands
of
crows
rose
above
the
walls
and
circled
in
the
air
cawing
and
noisily
flapping
their
wings
.
together
with
that
sound
came
a
solitary
human
cry
from
the
gateway
and
amid
the
smoke
appeared
the
fig
ure
of
a
bareheaded
man
in
a
peasants
coat
.
he
grasped
a
musket
and
took
aim
at
the
french
.
fire
repeated
the
officer
once
more
and
the
reports
of
a
musket
and
of
two
cannon
shots
were
heard
simultaneously
.
the
gate
was
again
hidden
by
smoke
.
nothing
more
stirred
behind
the
screens
and
the
french
infantry
soldiers
and
officers
advanced
to
the
gate
.
in
the
gateway
lay
three
wounded
and
four
dead
.
two
men
in
peasant
coats
ran
away
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
toward
the

.

the
officer
pointing
to
the

and
the

and
the

after
dispatching

the

over
the

neither

what

as

.
when
five
weeks
later
these

they
no

was
no

merely
to

ten

after

not

before

to

the
soldiers
ran
out
into
the

to

the
city
and
hearing
that
everything
had
been

rushed
to
places
where

were

the

or
later
on
to

their

it

that
there

the
fire

moscow

by

owners

in
which

moscow
was
burned
by
its
inhabitants
it
is
true
but
by
those
who
had
abandoned
it
and
not
by
those
who
remained
in
it
.
moscow
when
occupied
by
the
enemy
did
not
remain
intact
like
berlin
vienna
and
other
towns
simply
because
its
inhabitants
abandoned
it
and
did
not
wel
come
the
french
with
bread
and
salt
nor
bring
them
the
keys
of

chapter
xxvii
the
absorption
of
the
french
by
moscow
ra
diating
starwise
as
it
did
only
reached
the
quarter
where
pierre
was
staying
by
the
eve
ning
of
the
second
of
september
.
after
the
last
two
days
spent
in
solitude
and
unusual
circumstances
pierre
was
in
a
state
bordering
on
insanity
.
he
was
completely
ob
sessed
by
one
persistent
thought
.
he
did
not
know
how
or
when
this
thought
had
taken
such
possession
of
him
but
he
remembered
nothing
of
the
past
understood
nothing
of
the
present
and
all
he
saw
and
heard
ap
peared
to
him
like
a
dream
.
he
had
left
home
only
to
escape
the
intri
cate
tangle
of
lifes
demands
that
enmeshed
him
and
which
in
his
present
condition
he
was
unable
to
unravel
.
he
had
gone
to
joseph
alexeevichs
house
on
the
plea
of
sorting
the
war
and
peace
deceaseds
books
and
papers
only
in
search
of
rest
from
lifes
turmoil
for
in
his
mind
the
memory
of
joseph
alexevich
was
connected
with
a
world
of
eternal
solemn
and
calm
thoughts
quite
contrary
to
the
restless
confu
sion
into
which
he
felt
himself
being
drawn
.
he
sought
a
quiet
refuge
and
in
joseph
alex
evichs
study
he
really
found
it
.
when
he
sat
with
his
elbows
on
the
dusty
writing
table
in
the
deathlike
stillness
of
the
study
calm
and
significant
memories
of
the
last
few
days
rose
one
after
another
in
his
imagination
particu
larly
of
the
battle
of
borodin6
and
of
that
vague
sense
of
his
own
insignificance
and
in
sincerity
compared
with
the
truth
simplicity
and
strength
of
the
class
of
men
he
mentally
classed
as
they
.
when
gerdsim
roused
him
from
his
reverie
the
idea
occurred
to
him
of
taking
part
in
the
popular
defense
of
moscow
which
he
knew
was
projected
.
and
with
that
object
he
had
asked
gerdsim
to
get
him
a
peas
ants
coat
and
a
pistol
confiding
to
him
his
in
tentions
of
remaining
in
joseph
alexevichs
house
and
keeping
his
name
secret
.
then
dur
ing
the
first
day
spent
in
inaction
and
solitude
he
tried
several
times
to
fix
his
attention
on
the
masonic
manuscripts
but
was
unable
to
do
so
the
idea
that
had
previously
occurred
to
him
of
the
cabalistic
significance
of
his
name
in
connection
with
bonapartes
more
than
once
vaguely
presented
itself
.
but
the
idea
that
he
lrusse
besuhof
was
destined
to
set
a
limit
to
the
power
of
the
beast
was
as
yet
only
one
of
the
fancies
that
often
passed
through
his
mind
and
left
no
trace
behind
.
when
having
bought
the
coat
merely
with
the
object
of
taking
part
among
the
people
in
the
defense
of
moscow
pierre
had
met
the
rost6vs
and
natdsha
had
said
to
him
are
you
remaining
in
moscow

.

.

.
how
splendid
the
thought
flashed
into
his
mind
that
it
really
would
be
a
good
thing
even
if
moscow
were
taken
for
him
to
remain
there
and
do
what
he
was
predestined
to
do
.
next
day
with
the
sole
idea
of
not
sparing
himself
and
not
lagging
in
any
way
behind
them
pierre
went
to
the
three
hills
gate
.
but
when
he
returned
to
the
house
convinced
that
moscow
would
not
be
defended
he
suddenly
felt
that
what
before
had
seemed
to
him
mere
ly
a
possibility
had
now
become
absolutely
nec
essary
and
inevitable
.
he
must
remain
in
mos
cow
concealing
his
name
and
must
meet
na
poleon
and
kill
him
and
either
perish
or
put
an
end
to
the
misery
of
all
europe
which
it
seemed
to
him
was
solely
due
to
napoleon
.
pierre
knew
all
the
details
of
the
attempt
on
bonapartes
life
in
1809
by
a
german
student
in
vienna
and
knew
that
the
student
had
been
shot
.
and
the
risk
to
which
he
would
expose
his
life
by
carrying
out
his
design
excited
him
still
more
.
two
equally
strong
feelings
drew
pierre
ir
resistibly
to
this
purpose
.
the
first
was
a
feel
ing
of
the
necessity
of
sacrifice
and
suffering
in
view
of
the
common
calamity
the
same
feeling
that
had
caused
him
to
go
to
mozhdysk
on
the
twentyfifth
and
to
make
his
way
to
the
very
thick
of
the
battle
and
had
now
caused
him
to
run
away
from
his
home
and
in
place
of
the
luxury
and
comfort
to
which
he
was
accus
tomed
to
sleep
on
a
hard
sofa
without
undress
ing
and
eat
the
same
food
as
gerdsim
.
the
oth
er
was
that
vague
and
quite
russian
feeling
of
contempt
for
everything
conventional
artifi
cial
and
human
for
everything
the
majority
of
men
regard
as
the
greatest
good
in
the
world
.
pierre
had
first
experienced
this
strange
and
fascinating
feeling
at
the
slob6da
palace
when
he
had
suddenly
felt
that
wealth
power
and
lifeall
that
men
so
painstakingly
acquire
and
guard
if
it
has
any
worth
has
so
only
by
rea
son
of
the
joy
with
which
it
can
all
be
renounced
.
it
was
the
feeling
that
induces
a
volunteer
recruit
to
spend
his
last
penny
on
drink
and
a
drunken
man
to
smash
mirrors
or
glasses
for
no
apparent
reason
and
knowing
that
it
will
cost
him
all
the
money
he
possesses
the
feel
ing
which
causes
a
man
to
perform
actions
which
from
an
ordinary
point
of
view
are
in
sane
to
test
as
it
were
his
personal
power
and
strength
affirming
the
existence
of
a
higher
no
n
human
criterion
of
life
.
from
the
very
day
pierre
had
experienced
this
feeling
for
the
first
time
at
the
slob6da
palace
he
had
been
continuously
under
its
in
fluence
but
only
now
found
full
satisfaction
for
it
.
moreover
at
this
moment
pierre
was
supported
in
his
design
and
prevented
from
renouncing
it
by
what
he
had
already
done
in
that
direction
.
if
he
were
now
to
leave
mos
cow
like
everyone
else
his
flight
from
home
the
peasant
coat
the
pistol
and
his
announce
ment
to
the
rost6vs
that
he
would
remain
in
moscow
would
all
become
not
merely
mean
ingless
but
contemptible
and
ridiculous
and
to
this
pierre
was
very
sensitive
.
pierres
physical
condition
as
is
always
the
case
corresponded
to
his
mental
state
.
the
unaccustomed
coarse
food
the
vodka
he
drank
during
those
days
the
absence
of
wine
and
cigars
his
dirty
unchanged
linen
two
almost
book
eleven
sleepless
nights
passed
on
a
short
sofa
without
bedding
all
this
kept
him
in
a
state
of
excite
ment
bordering
on
insanity
.
it
was
two
oclock
in
the
afternoon
.
the
french
had
already
entered
moscow
.
pierre
knew
this
but
instead
of
acting
he
only
thought
about
his
undertaking
going
over
its
minutest
details
in
his
mind
.
in
his
fancy
he
did
not
clearly
picture
to
himself
either
the
striking
of
the
blow
or
the
death
of
napoleon
but
with
extraordinary
vividness
and
melancholy
en
joyment
imagined
his
own
destruction
and
heroic
endurance
.
yes
alone
for
the
sake
of
all
i
must
do
it
or
perish
i
he
thought
.
yes
i
will
approach

.

.

.
and
then
suddenly

.

.

.
with
pistol
or
dag
ger
but
that
is
all
the
same
it
is
not
i
but
the
hand
of
providence
that
punishes
thee
i
shall
say
thought
he
imagining
what
he
would
say
when
killing
napoleon
.
well
then
take
me
and
execute
me
he
went
on
speaking
to
himself
and
bowing
his
head
with
a
sad
but
firm
expression
.
while
pierre
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
talking
to
himself
in
this
way
the
study
door
opened
and
on
the
threshold
ap
peared
the
figure
of
makar
alexevich
always
so
timid
before
but
now
quite
transformed
.
his
dressing
gown
was
unfastened
his
face
red
and
distorted
.
he
was
obviously
drunk
.
on
seeing
pierre
he
grew
confused
at
first
but
noticing
embarrassment
on
pierres
face
im
mediately
grew
bold
and
staggering
on
his
thin
legs
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
room
.
theyre
frightened
he
said
confidentially
in
a
hoarse
voice
.
i
say
i
wont
surrender
i
say

.

.

.
am
i
not
right
sir
he
paused
and
then
suddenly
seeing
the
pistol
on
the
table
seized
it
with
unexpected
rapidity
and
ran
out
into
the
corridor
.
gerdsim
and
the
porter
who
had
followed
makar
alexevich
stopped
him
in
the
vesti
bule
and
tried
to
take
the
pistol
from
him
.
pierre
coming
out
into
the
corridor
looked
with
pity
and
repulsion
at
the
halfcrazy
old
man
.
makar
alexdevich
frowning
with
exer
tion
held
on
to
the
pistol
and
screamed
hoarse
ly
evidently
with
some
heroic
fancy
in
his
head
.

whispered
gerdsim
to
the
porter
.
they
seized
makar
alexevich
by
the
arms
and
dragged
him
to
the
door
.
the
vestibule
was
filled
with
the
discordant
sounds
of
a
struggle
and
of
a
tipsy
hoarse
voice
.
suddenly
a
fresh
sound
a
piercing
feminine
scream
reverberated
from
the
porch
and
the
cook
came
running
into
the
vestibule
.

gerdsim
and
the

let

go
and
in
the
now
silent
corridor
the
sound
of
several
hands
knocking
at
the
front
door
could
be
heard
.
chapter
xxviii
pierre
having
decided
that
until
he
had
car
ried
out
his
design
he
would
disclose
neither
his
identity
nor
his
knowledge
of
french
stood
at
the
halfopen
door
of
the
corridor
intend
ing
to
conceal
himself
as
soon
as
the
french
entered
.
but
the
french
entered
and
still
pierre
did
not
retire
an
irresistible
curiosity
kept
him
there
.
there
were
two
of
them
.
one
was
an
officer
a
tall
soldierly
handsome
man
the
other
evidently
a
private
or
an
orderly
sunburned
short
and
thin
with
sunken
cheeks
and
a
dull
expression
.
the
officer
walked
in
front
lean
ing
on
a
stick
and
slightly
limping
.
when
he
had
advanced
a
few
steps
he
stopped
having
apparently
decided
that
these
were
good
quar
ters
turned
round
to
the
soldiers
standing
at
the
entrance
and
in
a
loud
voice
of
command
ordered
them
to
put
up
the
horses
.
having
done
that
the
officer
lifting
his
elbow
with
a
smart
gesture
stroked
hjs
mustache
and
light
ly
touched
his
hat
.
bonour
la
compagnie
said
he
gaily
smiling
and
looking
about
him
.
no
one
gave
any
reply
.

the
officer
asked
gerasim
.
gerdsim
gazed
at
the
officer
with
an
alarmed
and
inquiring
look
.

added
he
clapping
the
scared
and
silent
gerdsim
on
the
shoulder
.
well
does
no
one
speak
french
in
this
establishment
he
asked
again
in
french
looking
around
and
meeting
pierres
eyes
.
pierre
moved
away
from
the
door
.
again
the
officer
turned
to
gerdsim
and
asked
him
to
show
him
the
rooms
in
the
house
.
master
not
here

.

you

.

.

.
said
gerasim
trying
to
render
his
words
more
comprehensible
by
contorting
them
.
still
smiling
the
french
officer
spread
out
his
hands
before
gerasims
nose
intimating
that
he
did
not
understand
him
either
and
moved
limping
to
the
door
at
which
pierre
was
standing
.
pierre
wished
to
go
away
and
conceal
himself
but
at
that
moment
he
saw
makar
alexdevichappcaringat
the
open
kitch
en
door
with
the
pistol
in
his
hand
.
with
a
madmans
cunning
makar
alexeevicheyed
the
frenchman
raised
his
pistol
and
took
aim
.
board
them
yelled
the
tipsy
man
trying
to
press
the
trigger
.
hearing
the
yell
the
officer
turned
round
and
at
the
same
moment
pierre
threw
himself
on
the
drunkard
.
just
when
pierre
snatched
at
and
struck
up
the
pistol
ma
kdr
alexevich
at
last
got
his
fingerson
the
trig
ger
there
was
a
deafening
report
and
all
were
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
.
the
french
man
turned
pale
and
rushed
to
the
door
.
forgetting
his
intention
of
concealing
his
knowledge
of
french
pierre
snatching
away
the
pistol
and
throwing
it
down
ran
up
to
the
officer
and
addressed
him
in
french
.
you
are
not
wounded
he
asked
.
i
think
not
answered
the
frenchman
feeling
himself
over
.
but
i
have
had
a
lucky
escape
this
time
he
added
pointing
to
the
damaged
plaster
of
the
wall
.
who
is
that
man
said
he
looking
sternly
at
pierre
.
oh
i
am
really
in
despair
at
what
has
oc
curred
said
pierre
rapidly
quite
forgetting
the
part
he
had
intended
to
play
.
he
is
an
un
fortunate
madman
who
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
.
the
officer
went
up
to
makdr
alexevichand
took
him
by
the
collar
.
makar

was
standing
with

swaying
as
if
about
to

as
he
leaned
against
the
wall
.
brigand
you
shall

for
this
said
the
frenchman
letting
go
of
him
.
we
french
are
merciful
after

but
we
do
not
pardon
traitors
he
added
with
a
look
of
gloomy
dig
nity
and
a
fine
energetic
gesture
.
pierre
continued
in
french
to
persuade
the
officer
not
to
hold
that
drunken
imbecile
to
ac
count
.
the
frenchman
listened
in
silence
with
the
same
gloomy
expression
but
suddenly
turned
to
pierre
with
a
smile
.
for
a
few
sec
onds
he
looked
at
him
in
silence
.
his
hand
some
face
assumed
a
melodramatically
gentle
expression
arid
he
held
out
his
hand
.
you
have
saved
my
life
.
you
are
french
said
he
.
for
a
frenchman
that
deduction
was
indu
bitable
.
only
a
frenchman
could
perform
a
great
deed
and
to
save
his
life
the
life
of
m
.
ramballc
captain
of
the
igth
light
regiment
was
undoubtedly
a
very
great
deed
.
but
however
indubitable

conclusion
and
the
officers
conviction
based
upon

to

the

waving
his

before

and
smiling

well
and
what
are
we
to
do
with
this
man
he
added
addressing
himself
to
pierre
as
to
a
brother
.
even
if
pierre
were
not
a

that

of

could
not

in
reply
to
his
last
question
pierre
again
explained
who

was
and
how
just
before
their
arrival
that
drunken
imbecile
had
seized
the
loaded
pistol
which
they
had
not
had
time
to
recover
from
him
and
begged
the
officer
to
let
the
deed
go
unpunished
.
the
frenchman
expanded
his
chest
and
made
a
majestic
gesture
with
his
arm
.
you
have
saved
my
life
you
are
french

ask
his
pardon

grant
it

that
man
away
said
he
quickly
and
energetically
and
taking
the
arm
of
pierre
whom
he
had
promoted
to
be
a
frenchman
for
saving
his
life
he
went
with
him
into
the
room
.
the
soldiers
in
the
yard
hearing
the
shot
came
into
the
passage
asking
what
had
hap
pened
and
expressed
their
readiness
to
punish
the
culprits
but
the
officer
sternly
checked
them
.

said

the

went
out
again

who
had
meanwhile
had
time
to
visit

up

chapter
xxix
when
the
french
officer
went
into
the
room
with
pierre
the
latter
again
thought
it
his
duty
to
assure
him
that
he
was
not
french
and
wished
to
go
away
but
the
officer
would
not
hear
of
it
.
he
was
so
very
polite
amiable
good
natured
and
genuinely
grateful
to
pierre
for
saving
his
life
that
pierre
had
not
the
heart
to
refuse
and
sat
down
with
him
in
the
parlor
the
first
room
they
entered
.
to
pierres
as
surances
that
he
was
not
a
frenchman
the
captain
evidently
not
understanding
how
any
one
could
decline
so
flattering
an
appellation
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
that
if
pierre
absolutely
insisted
on
passing
for
a
russian
let
it
be
so
but
for
all
that
he
would
be
for
ever
bound
to
pierre
by
gratitude
for
saving
his
life
.
had
this
man
been
endowed
with
the
slight
est
capacity
for
perceiving
the
feelings
of
oth
ers
and
had
he
at
all
understood
what
pierres
feelings
were
the
latter
would
probably
have
left
him
but
the
mans
animated
obtuseness
to
everything
other
than
himself
disarmed

.

said
the
officer
looking
at
pierres

dirty

and
at
the
ring
on
his
fin
ger
.
i
owe
my

to

you

a

never
forgets
either
an
insult
or
a
service
.
i
offer
you
my
friendship
.
that
is
all
i
can
say
.
there
was
so
much
good
nature
and
nobility
in
the
french
sense
of
the
word
in
the
officers
voice
in
the
expression
of
his
face
and
in
his
gestures
that
pierre
unconsciously
smiling
in
response
to
the
frenchmans
smile
pressed
the
hand
held
out
to
him

seventh
of

he
in
troduced
himself
a
selfsatisfied
irrepressible
smile
puckering
his
lips
under
his
mustache
.
will
you
now
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
with
whom
i
have
the
honor
of
conversing
so
pleas
antly
instead
of
being
in
the
ambulance
with
that
maniacs
bullet
in
my

pierre
replied
that
he
could
not
tell
him
his
name
and
blushing
began
to
try
to
invent
a
name
and
to
say
something
about
his
reason
for
concealing
it
but
the
frenchman
hastily
interrupted
him
.
oh
please
said
he
.
i
understand
your
reasons
.
you
are
an
officer

..
.
a
superior
officer
perhaps
.
you
have
borne
arms
against
us
.
thats
not
my
business
.
i
owe
you
my
life
.
that
is
enough
for
me
.
i
am
quite
at
your
serv
ice
.
you
belong
to
the
gentry
he
concluded
with
a
shade
of
inquiry
in
his
tone
.
pierre
bent
his
head
.
your

name
if
you
please
.
that
is
all
i
ask

you
say
.

excellent
thats
all
i
want
to
know
.
when
the
mutton
and
an
omelet
had
been
served
and
a
samovar
and
vodka
brought
with
some
wine
which
the
french
had
taken
from
a
russian
cellar
and
brought
with
them
ram
balle
invited
pierre
to
share
his
dinner
and
himself
began
to
eat
greedily
and
quickly
like
a
healthy
and
hungry
man
munching
his
food
rapidly
with
his
strong
teeth
continually
smacking
his
lips
and
repeating
excellent
delicious
his
face
grew
red
and
was
covered
with
perspiration
.
pierre
was
hungry
and
shared
the
dinner
with
pleasure
.
morel
the
orderly
brought
some
hot
water
in
a
saucepan
and
placed
a
bottle
of
claret
in
it
.
he
also
brought
a
bottle
of
kvass
taken
from
the
kitch
en
for
them
to
try
.
that
beverage
was
already
known
to
the
french
and
had
been
given
a
special
name
.
they
called
it
limonade
de
co
chon
pigs
lemonade
and
morel
spoke
well
of
the
limonade
de
cochon
he
had
found
in
the
kitchen
.
but
as
the
captain
had
the
wine
they
had
taken
while
passing
through
moscow
he
left
the
kvass
to
morel
and
applied
himself
to
the
bottle
of
bordeaux
.
he
wrapped
the
bot
tle
up
to
its
neck
in
a
table
napkin
and
poured
out
wine
for
himself
and
for
pierre
.
the
satis
faction
of
his
hunger
and
the
wine
rendered
the
captain
still
more
lively
and
he
chatted
in
cessantly
all
through
dinner
.
yes
my
dear
monsieur
pierre
i
owe
you
a
fine
votive
candle
for
saving
me
from
that
maniac
.

.

.

you
see
i
have
bullets
enough
in
my
body
already
.
here
is
one
i
got
at
wagram
he
touched
his
side
and
a
second
at
smo
tensk
he
showed
a
scar
on
his
cheek
and
this
leg
which
as
you
see
does
not
want
to
march
i
got
that
on
the
seventh
at
the
great
battle
of

you
may
be
proud
of
it
and
on
my
honor
in
spite
of
the
cough
i
caught
there
i
should
be
ready
to

again
.
i
pity
those
who
did

i

there
said
pierre
.
bah
really
so

you
are

brave

the
great
redoubt
held
out
well
by
my
pipe
continued
the
french
man
.
and
you
made
us
pay
dear
for
it
.
i
was
at
it
three
times
sure
as
i
sit
here
.
three
times
we
reached
the
guns
and
three
times
we
were
thrown
back
like
cardboard
figures
.
oh
it
was
beautiful
monsieur
pierre
your
grena
diers
were
splendid
by
heaven
i
saw
them
close
up
their
ranks
six
times
in
succession
and
march
as
if
on
parade
.
fine
fellows
our
king
of
naples
who
knows
whats
what
cried
bravo
ha
ha
so
you
are
one
of

he
added
smiling
after
a
momentary
pause
.
so
much
the

so
much
the

.

.

.
with
the
fair
he
winked
and
smiled
thats
what
the
french
are
monsieur
pierre
arent
they
the
captain
was
so
naively
and
goodhumor
edly
gay
so
real
and
so
pleased
with
himself
that
pierre
almost
winked
back
as
he
looked
merrily
at
him
.
probably
the
word
gallant
turned
the
captains
thoughts
to
the
state
of
moscow
.
apropos
tell
me
please
is
it
true
that
the
women
have
all
left
moscow
what
a
queer
idea
what
had
they
to
be
afraid
of
would
not
the
french
ladies
leave
paris
if
the
russians
entered
it
asked
pierre
.
ha
ha
ha
the
frenchman
emitted
a
merry
sanguine
chuckle
patting
pierre
on
the
shoulder
.
what
a
thing
to
say
he
exclaimed
.
paris

.

.

.
but
paris
paris

.

.

.
paris
the
capital
of
the
world
pierre
fin
ished
his
remark
for
him
.
the
captain
looked
at
pierre
.
he
had
a
hab
it
of
stoppingshort
in
the
middle
of
his
talk
and
gazing
intently
with
his
laughing
kindly
eyes
.
well
if
you
hadnt
told
me
you
were
rus
sian
i
should
have
wagered
that
you
were
parisian
you
have
that

..
.
i
dont
know
what
that

.

.

.
and
having
uttered
this
compliment
he
again
gazed
at
him
in
silence
.
i
have
been
in
paris
.
i
spent
years
there
said
pierre
.
oh
yes
one
sees
that
plainly
.
paris

..
.
a
man
who
doesnt
know
paris
is
a
savage

and
noticing
that
his
conclusion
was
weaker
than
what
had
gone
before
he
add
ed
quickly
there
is
only
one
paris
in
the
world
.
you
have
been
to
paris
and
have
re
mained

well
i
dont
esteem
you
the
less
for
it
.
under
the
influence
of
the
wine
he
had
drunk
and
after
the
days
he
had
spent
alone
with
his
depressing
thoughts
pierre
involun
tarily
enjoyed
talking
with
this
cheerful
and
goodnatured
man
.
to
return
to
your
ladies
i
hear
they
are
lovely
.
what
a
wretched
idea
to
go
and
bury
themselves
in
the
steppes
when
the
french
ar
my
is
in
moscow
.
what
a
chance
those
girls
have
missed
your
peasants
now
thats
an
other
thing

then
the

he
began
but

interrupted
him

the

repeated
and
his
face
suddenly
became
sad

embarrassed

is
i
ramballe
who
tell
you
so
.

i
assure
you
i
was
his
enemy
eight
years
ago
.
my
fa
ther
was
an
emigrant
count
.

.

.

.
but
that
man
has
vanquished
me
.
he
has
taken
hold
of
me
.
i
could
not
resist
the
sight
of
the
grandeur
and
glory
with
which
he
has
covered
france
.
when
i
understood
what
he
wanted
when
i
saw
that
he
was
preparing
a
bed
of
laurels
for
us
you
know
i
said
to
myself
that
is
a
monarch
and
i
devoted
myself
to
him
so
there
oh
yes
mon
cher
he
is
the
greatest
man
of
the
ages
past
or
future
.
is
he
in
moscow
pierre
stammered
with
a
guilty
look
.
the
frenchman
looked
at
his
guilty
face
and
smiled
.
no
he
will
make
his
entry
tomorrow
he
replied
and
continued
his
talk
.
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
cries
of
several
voices
at
the
gate
and
by
morel
who
came
to
say
that
some
wurttemberg
hus
sars
had
come
and
wanted
to
put
up
their
horses
in
the
yard
where
the
captains
horses
were
.
this
difficulty
had
arisen
chiefly
because
the
hussars
did
not
understand
what
was
said
to
them
in
french
.

the
famous

tr
.
the
captain
had
their
senior
sergeant
called
in
and
in
a
stern
voice
asked
him
to
what
reg
iment
he
belonged
who
was
his
commanding
officer
and
by
what
right
he
allowed
himself
to
claim
quarters
that
were
already
occupied
.
the
german
who
knew
little
french
answered
the
two
first
questions
by
giving
the
names
of
his
regiment
and
of
his
commanding
officer
but
in
reply
to
the
third
question
which
he
did
not
understand
said
introducing
broken
french
into
his
own
german
that
he
was
the
quartermaster
of
the
regiment
and
his
com
mander
had
ordered
him
to
occupy
all
the
houses
one
after
another
.
pierre
who
knew
german
translated
what
the
german
said
to
the
captain
and
gave
the
captains
reply
to
the
wurttemberg
hussar
in
german
.
when
he
had
understood
what
was
said
to
him
the
german
submitted
and
took
his
men
elsewhere
.
the
captain
went
out
into
the
porch
and
gave
some
orders
in
a
loud
voice
.
when
he
returned
to
the
room
pierre
was
sitting
in
the
same
place
as
before
with
his
head
in
his
hands
.
his
face
expressed
suffering
.
he
really
was
suffering
at
that
moment
.
when
the
captain
went
out
and
he
was
left
alone
suddenly
he
came
to
himself
and
realized
the
po
sition
he
was
in
.
it
was
not
that
moscow
had
been
taken
or
that
the
happy
conquerors
were
masters
in
it
and
were
patronizing
him
.
painful
as
that
was
it
was
not
that
which
tormented
pierre
at
the
moment
.
he
was
tormented
by
the
consciousness
of
his
own
weakness
.
the
few
glasses
of
wine
he
had
drunk
and
the
conversa
tion
with
this
goodnatured
man
had
destroyed
the
mood
of
concentrated
gloom
in
which
he
had
spent
the
last
few
days
and
which
was
es
sential
for
the
execution
of
his
design
.
the
pis
tol
dagger
and
peasant
coat
were
ready
.
napo
leon
was
to
enter
the
town
next
day
.
pierre
still
considered
that
it
would
be
a
useful
and
worthy
action
to
slay
the
evildoer
but
now
he
felt
that
he
would
not
do
it
.
he
did
not
know
why
but
he
felt
a
foreboding
that
he
would
not
carry
out
his
intention
.
he
struggled
against
the
con
fession
of
his
weakness
but
dimly
felt
that
he
could
not
overcome
it
and
that
his
former
gloomy
frame
of
mind
concerning
vengeance
killing
and
selfsacrifice
had
been
dispersed
like
dust
by
contact
with
the
first
man
he
met
.
the
captain
returned
to
the
room
limping
slightly
and
whistling
a
tune
.
the
frenchmans
chatter
which
had
previ
ously
amused
pierre
now
repelled
him
.
the
tune
he
was
whistling
his
gait
and
the
gesture
book
eleven

with
which
he
twirled
his
mustache
all
now
seemed
offensive
.
i
will
go
away
immediately
.
i
wont
say
another
word
to
him
thought
pierre
.
he
thought
this
but
still
sat
in
the
same
place
.
a
strange
feeling
of
weakness
tied
him
to
the
spot
he
wished
to
get
up
and
go
away
but
could
not
do
so
.
the
captain
on
the
other
hand
seemed
very
cheerful
.
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
twice
.
his
eyes
shone
and
his
mustache
twitched
as
if
he
were
smiling
to
himself
at
some
amus
ing
thought
.
the
colonel
of
those
wurttembergers

suddenly
said
.

he
sat
down
facing
pierre
.
by
the
way
you
know

then
pierre
looked
at
him
in
silence
.
what
is

repeated
.

the
captain
asked
quickly
and
doubtfully
.

pierre
repeated
.
onterkoff
said
the
captain
and
looked
at
pierre
for
some
seconds
with
laughing
eyes
.
these
germans
are
firstrate
fools
dont
you
think
so
monsieur
pierre
he
concluded
.
well

he
called
out
gaily
.
morel
brought
candles
and
a
bottle
of
wine
.
the
captain
looked
at
pierre
by
the
candle
light
and
was
evidently
struck
by
the
troubled
expression
on
his
companions
face
.
ramballe
with
genuine
distress
and
sympathy
in
his
face
went
up
to
pierre
and
bent
over
him
.
there
now
were
sad
said
he
touching
pierres
hand
.

he
asked
pierre
.
perhaps
its
the
state
of
affairs
pierre
did
not
answer
but
looked
cordially
into
the
frenchmans
eyes
whose
expression
of
sympathy
was
pleasing
to
him
.
honestly
without
speaking
of
what
i
owe

i
feel
friendship
for
you
.
can
i
do
any
thing
for

it

death
.
i
say
it
with
my
hand
on
my
heart
said
he
striking
his
chest
.
thank
you
said
pierre
.
the
captain
gazed
intently
at
him
as
he
had
done
when
he
learned
that
shelter
was
unterkunft
in
german
and
his
face
suddenly
brightened
.
well
in
that
case
i
drink
to
our
friend
50
war
and
peace
ship
he
cried
gaily
filling
two
glasses
with
wine
.
pierre
took
one
of
the
glasses
and
emptied
it
.
ramballe
emptied
his
too
again
pressed
pierres
hand
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
in
a
pensive
attitude
.
yes
my
dear
friend
he
began
such
is
fortunes
caprice
.
who
would
have
said
that
i
should
be
a
soldier
and
a
captain
of
dragoons
in
the
service
of
bonaparte
as
we
used
to
call
him
yet
here
i
am
in
moscow
with
him
.
i
must
tell
you
mon
cher
he
continued
in
the
sad
and
measured
tones
of
a
man
who
intends
to
tell
a
long
story
that
our
name
is
one
of
the
most
ancient
in
france
.
and
with
a
frenchmans
easy
and
naive
frankness
the
captain
told
pierre
the
story
of
his
ancestors
his
childhood
youth
and
man
hood
and
all
about
his
relations
and
his
finan
cial
and
family
affairs
ma
pauvre
mtre
play
ing
of
course
an
important
part
in
the
story
.
but
all
that
is
only
lifes
setting
the
real
thing
is
love
love
am
i
not
right
monsieur
pierre
said
he
growing
animated
.
another
glass
pierre
again
emptied
his
glass
and
poured
himself
out
a
third
.
oh
women
women
and
the
captain
looking
with
glistening
eyes
at
pierre
began
talking
of
love
and
of
his
love
affairs
.
there
were
very
many
of
these
as
one
could
easily
believe
looking
at
the
officers
hand
some
selfsatisfied
face
and
noting
the
eager
enthusiasm
with
which
he
spoke
of
women
.
though
all
ramballes
love
stories
had
the
sensual
character
which
frenchmen
regard
as
the
special
charm
and
poetry
of
love
yet
he
told
his
story
with
such
sincere
conviction
that
he
alone
had
experienced
and
known
all
the
charm
of
love
and
he
described
women
so
al
luringly
that
pierre
listened
to
him
with
curi
osity
.
it
was
plain
that
i
amour
which
the
french
man
was
so
fond
of
was
not
that
low
and
simple
kind
that
pierre
had
once
felt
for
his
wife
nor
was
it
the
romantic
love
stimulated
by
himself
that
he
experienced
for
natasha
.
ramballe
de
spised
both
these
kinds
of
love
equally
the
one
he
considered
the
love
of
clodhoppers
and
the
other
the
love
of
simpletons
.
l
amour
which
the
frenchman
worshiped
consisted
principally
in
the
unnaturalness
of
his
relation
to
the
woman
and
in
a
combination
of
incon
gruities
giving
the
chief
charm
to
the
feeling
.
thus
the
captain
touchingly
recounted
the
story
of
his
love
for
a
fascinating
marquise
of
thirtyfive
and
at
the
same
time
for
a
charm
ing
innocent
child
of
seventeen
daughter
of
the
bewitching
marquise
.
the
conflict
of
mag
nanimity
between
the
mother
and
the
daugh
ter
ending
in
the
mothers
sacrificing
herself
and
offering
her
daughter
in
marriage
to
her
lover
even
now
agitated
the
captain
though
it
was
the
memory
of
a
distant
past
.
then
he
re
counted
an
episode
in
which
the
husband
played
the
part
of
the
lover
and
he
the
lover
assumed
the
role
of
the
husband
as
well
as
several
droll
incidents
from
his
recollections
of
germany
where
shelter
is
called
unterkunft
and
where
the
husbands
eat
sauerkraut
and
the
young
girls
are
too
blonde
.
finally
the
latest
episode
in
poland
still
fresh
in
the
captains
memory
and
which
he
narrated
with
rapid
gestures
and
glowing
face
was
of
how
he
had
saved
the
life
of
a
pole
in
general
the
saving
of
life
continually
occurred
in
the
captains
stories
and
the
pole
had
en
trusted
to
him
his
enchanting
wife
parisienne
de
cceur
while
himself
entering
the
french
service
.
the
captain
was
happy
the
enchant
ing
polish
lady
wished
to
elope
with
him
but
prompted
by
magnanimity
the
captain
re
stored
the
wife
to
the
husband
saying
as
he
did
so
i
have
saved
your
life
and
i
save
your
honor
having
repeated
these
words
the
cap
tain
wiped
his
eyes
and
gave
himself
a
shake
as
if
driving
away
the
weakness
which
assailed
him
at
this
touching
recollection
.
listening
to
the
captains
tales
pierre
as
often
happens
late
in
the
evening
and
under
the
influence
of
wine
followed
all
that
was
told
him
understood
it
all
and
at
the
same
time
followed
a
train
of
personal
memories
which
he
knew
not
why
suddenly
arose
in
his
mind
.
while
listening
to
these
love
stories
his
own
love
for
natasha
unexpectedly
rose
to
his
mind
and
going
over
the
pictures
of
that
love
in
his
imagination
he
mentally
compared
them
with
ramballes
tales
.
listening
to
the
story
of
the
struggle
between
love
and
duty
pierre
saw
before
his
eyes
every
minutest
de
tail
of
his
last
meeting
with
the
object
of
his
love
at
the
sukharev
water
tower
.
at
the
time
of
that
meeting
it
had
not
produced
an
effect
upon
him
he
had
not
even
once
recalled
it
.
but
now
itseemed
to
him
that
that
meeting
had
had
in
it
something
very
important
and
poetic
.
peter
kirflovich
come
herel
we
have
rec
ognized
you
he
now
seemed
to
hear
the
words
she
had
uttered
and
to
see
before
him
her
eyes
her
smile
her
traveling
hood
and
a
stray
lock
of
her
hair

.

.

.
and
there
seemed
to
him
book
eleven
something
pathetic
and
touching
in
all
this
.
having
finished
his
tale
about
the
enchant
ing
polish
lady
the
captain
asked
pierre
if
he
had
ever
experienced
a
similar
impulse
to
sacrifice
himself
for
love
and
a
feeling
of
envy
of
the
legitimate
husband
.
challenged
by
this
question
pierre
raised
his
head
and
felt
a
need
to
express
the
thoughts
that
filled
his
mind
.
he
began
to
explain
that
he
understood
love
for
a
women
somewhat
differently
.
he
said
that
in
all
his
life
he
had
loved
and
still
loved
only
one
woman
and
that
she
could
never
be
his
.
tiens
said
the
captain
.
pierre
then
explained
that
he
had
loved
this
woman
from
his
earliest
years
but
that
he
had
not
dared
to
think
of
her
because
she
was
too
young
and
because
he
had
been
an
illegitimate
son
without
a
name
.
afterwards
when
he
had
received
a
name
and
wealth
he
dared
not
think
of
her
because
he
loved
her
too
well
placing
her
far
above
everything
in
the
world
and
es
pecially
therefore
above
himself
.
when
he
had
reached
this
point
pierre
asked
the
captain
whether
he
understood
that
.
the
captain
made
a
gesture
signifying
that
even
if
he
did
not
understand
it
he
begged
pierre
to
continue
.
platonic
love
clouds

.

.

.
he
muttered
.
whether
it
was
the
wine
he
had
drunk
or
an
impulse
of
frankness
or
the
thought
that
this
man
did
not
and
never
would
know
any
of
those
who
played
a
part
in
his
story
or
whether
it
was
all
these
things
together
some
thing
loosened
pierres
tongue
.
speaking
thick
ly
and
with
a
faraway
look
in
his
shining
eyes
he
told
the
whole
story
of
his
life
his
marriage
natashas
love
for
his
best
friend
her
betrayal
of
him
and
all
his
own
simple
relations
with
her
.
urged
on
oy
ramballes
questions
he
also
told
what
he
had
at
first
concealed
his
own
po
sition
and
even
his
name
.
more
than
anything
else
in
pierres
story
the
captain
was
impressed
by
the
fact
that
pierre
was
very
rich
had
two
mansions
in
moscow
and
that
he
had
abandoned
everything
and
not
left
the
city
but
remained
there
conceal
ing
his
name
and
station
.
when
it
was
late
at
night
they
went
out
to
gether
into
the
street
.
the
night
was
warm
and
light
.
to
the
left
of
the
house
on
the
pokr6vka
a
fire
glowed
the
first
of
those
that
were
be
ginning
in
moscow
.
to
the
right
and
high
up
in
the
sky
was
the
sickle
of
the
waning
moon
and
opposite
to
it
hung
that
bright
comet
which
was
connected
in
pierres
heart
with
his
love
.
at
the
gate
stood
gerdsim
the
cook
and
two
frenchmen
.
their
laughter
and
their
mu
tually
incomprehensible
remarks
in
two
lan
guages
could
be
heard
.
they
were
looking
at
the
glow
seen
in
the
town
.
there
was
nothing
terrible
in
the
one
small
distant
fire
in
the
immense
city
.
gazing
at
the
high
starry
sky
at
the
moon
at
the
comet
and
at
the
glow
from
the
fire
pierre
experienced
a
joyful
emotion
.
there
now
how
good
it
is
what
more
does
one
need
thought
he
.
and
suddenly
remembering
his
intention
he
grew
dizzy
and
felt
so
faint
that
he
leaned
against
the
fence
to
save
himself
from
falling
.
without
taking
leave
of
his
new
friend
.
pierre
left
the
gate
with
unsteady
steps
and
re
turning
to
his
room
lay
down
on
the
sofa
and
immediately
fell
asleep
.
chapter
xxx
the
glow
of
the
first
fire
that
began
on
the
second
of
september
was
watched
from
the
various
roads
by
the
fugitive
muscovites
and
by
the
retreating
troops
with
many
different
feelings
.
the
rostov
party
spent
the
night
at
mytish
chi
fourteen
miles
from
moscow
.
they
had
started
so
late
on
the
first
of
september
the
road
had
been
so
blocked
by
vehicles
a
nd
troops
so
many
things
had
been
forgotten
for
which
servants
were
sent
back
that
they
had
decided
to
spend
that
night
at
a
place
three
miles
out
of
moscow
.
the
next
morning
they
woke
late
and
were
again
delayed
so
often
that
they
only
got
as
far
as
great
mytfshchi
.
at
ten
oclock
that
evening
the
rost6v
family
and
the
wound
ed
traveling
with
them
were
all
distributed
in
the
yards
and
huts
of
that
large
village
.
the
rostovs
servants
and
coachmen
and
the
or
derlies
of
the
wounded
officers
after
attending
to
their
masters
had
supper
fed
the
horses
and
came
out
into
the
porches
.
in
a
neighboring
hut
lay
rac
vskis
adjutant
with
a
fractured
wrist
.
the
awful
pain
he
suf
fered
made
him
moan
incessantly
and
piteous
ly
and
his
moaning
sounded
terrible
in
the
darkness
of
the
autumn
night
.
he
had
spent
the
first
night
in
the
same
yard
as
the
rostovs
.
the
countess
said
she
had
been
unable
to
close
her
eyes
on
account
of
his
moaning
and
at
mystfshchi
she
moved
into
a
worse
hut
simply
to
be
farther
away
from
the
wounded
man
.
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
one
of
the
serv
ants
noticed
above
the
high
body
of
a
coach
standing
before
the
porch
the
small
glow
of
5
war
and
peace
another
fire
.
one
glow
had
long
been
visible
and
everybody
knew
that
it
was
little
mytish
chi
burning
set
on
fire
by
mam6novs
cos
sacks
.
but
look
here
brothers
theres
another
fire
remarked
an
orderly
.
all
turned
their
attention
to
the
glow
.
but
they
told
us
little
mytishchi
had
been
set
on
fire
by
mam6novs
cossacks
.
but
thats
not
mytishchi
its
farther
away
.
look
it
must
be
in
moscow
two
of
the
gazers
went
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
coach
and
sat
down
on
its
steps
.
its
more
to
the
left
why
little
mytishchi
is
over
there
and
this
is
right
on
the
other
side
.
several
men
joined
the
first
two
.
see
how
its
flaring
said
one
.
thats
a
fire
in
moscow
either
in
the
sushchvski
or
the
rog6zhski
quarter
.
no
one
replied
to
this
remark
and
for
some
time
they
all
gazed
silently
at
the
spreading
flames
of
the
second
fire
in
the
distance
.
old
daniel
terntich
the
counts
valet
as
he
was
called
came
up
to
the
group
and
shout

remarked
one
of
the
footmen
.
daniel
terntich
made
no
reply
and
again
for
a
long
time
they
were
all
silent
.
the
glow
spread
rising
and
falling
farther
and
farther
still
.

and

said
another
voice
.
just

daniel
terntich
who
had
hitherto
been
silent
was
heard
to
say
.
his
voice
was
calm
and
deliberate
.

.

.
his
voice
faltered
and
he
gave
way
to
an
old
mans
sob
.
and
it
was
as
if
they
had
all
only
waited
for
this
to
realize
the
significance
for
them
of
the
glow
they
were
watching
.
sighs
were
heard
words
of
prayer
and
the
sobbing
of
the
counts
old
valet
.
chapter
xxxi
the
valet
returning
to
the
cottage
informed
the
count
that
moscow
was
burning
.
the
count
donned
his
dressing
gown
and
went
out
to
look
.
s6nya
and
madame
schoss
who
had
not
yet
undressed
went
out
with
him
.
only
nata

and
the

remained
in

.
ptya
was
no
longer
with
the
family
he
had
gone
on
with
his
regiment
which
was
making
for
tr6itsa
.
the
countess
on
hearing
that
moscow
was
on
fire
began
to
cry
.
natdsha
pale
with
a
fixed
look
was
sitting
on
the
bench
under
the
icons
just
where
she
had
sat
down
on
arriving
and
paid
no
attention
to
her
fathers
words
.
she
was
listening
to
the
ceaseless
moaning
of
the
adjutant
three
houses
off
.
oh
how
terrible
said
s6nya
returning
from
the
yard
chilled
and
frightened
.
i
be
lieve
the
whole
of
moscow
will
burn
theres
an
awful
glow
natdsha
do
look
you
can
see
it
from
the
window
she
said
to
her
cousin
evi
dently
wishing
to
distract
her
mind
.
but
natdsha
looked
at
her
as
if
not
under
standing
what
was
said
to
her
and
again
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
corner
of
the
stove
.
she
had
been
in
this
condition
of
stupor
since
the
morn
ing
when
s6nya
to
the
surprise
and
annoy
ance
of
the
countess
had
for
some
unaccount
able
reason
found
it
necessary
to
tell
natdsha
of
prince
andrews
wound
and
of
his
being
with
their
party
.
the
countess
had
seldom
been
so
angry
with
anyone
as
she
was
with
s6nya
.
s6nya
had
cried
and
begged
to
be
for
given
and
now
as
if
trying
to
atone
for
her
fault
paid
unceasing
attention
to
her
cousin
.
look
natdsha
how
dreadfully
it
is
burn
ing
said
she
.
whats
burning
asked
natdsha
.
oh
yes
moscow
.
and
as
if
in
order
not
to
offend
s6nya
and
to
get
rid
of
her
she
turned
her
face
to
the
window
looked
out
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
evident
that
she
could
not
see
anything
and
again
settled
down
in
her
former
attitude
.
but
you
didnt
see
it
yes
really
i
did
natdsha
replied
in
a
voice
that
pleaded
to
be
left
in
peace
.
both
the
countess
and
s6nya
understood
that
naturally
neither
moscow
nor
the
burn
ing
of
moscow
nor
anything
else
could
seem
of
importance
to
natdsha
.
the
count
returned
and
lay
down
behind
the
partition
.
the
countess
went
up
to
her
daughter
and
touched
her
head
with
the
back
of
her
hand
as
she
was
wont
to
do
when
natd
book
eleven
53
sha
was
ill
then
touched
her
forehead
with
her
lips
as
if
to
feel
whether
she
was
feverish
and
finally
kissed
her
.
you
are
cold
.
you
are
trembling
all
over
.
youd
better
lie
down
said
the
countess
.
lie
down
all
right
i
will
.
ill
lie
down
at
once
said
natasha
.
when
natdsha
had
been
told
that
morning
that
prince
andrew
was
seriously
wounded
and
was
traveling
with
their
party
she
had
at
first
asked
many
questions
where
was
he
go
ing
how
was
he
wounded
was
it
serious
and
could
she
see
him
but
after
she
had
been
told
that
she
could
not
see
him
that
he
was
serious
ly
wounded
but
that
his
life
was
not
in
danger
she
ceased
to
ask
questions
or
to
speak
at
all
evidently
disbelieving
what
they
told
her
and
convinced
that
say
what
she
might
she
would
still
be
told
the
same
.
all
the
way
she
had
sat
motionless
in
a
corner
of
the
coach
with
wide
open
eyes
and
the
expression
in
them
which
the
countess
knew
so
well
and
feared
so
much
and
now
she
sat
in
the
same
way
on
the
bench
where
she
had
seated
herself
on
arriving
.
she
was
planning
something
and
either
deciding
or
had
already
decided
something
in
her
mind
.
the
countess
knew
this
but
what
it
might
be
she
did
not
know
and
this
alarmed
and
tor
mented
her
.
natdsha
undress
darling
lie
down
on
my
bed
.
a
bed
had
been
made
on
a
bedstead
for
the
countess
only
.
madame
schoss
and
the
two
girls
were
to
sleep
on
some
hay
on
the
floor
.
no
mamma
i
will
lie
down
here
on
the
floor
natasha
replied
irritably
and
she
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
.
through
the
open
window
the
moans
of
the
adjutant
could
be
heard
more
distinctly
.
she
put
her
head
out
into
the
damp
night
air
and
the
countess
saw
her
slim
neck
shaking
with
sobs
and
throbbing
against
the
window
frame
.
natdsha
knew
it
was
not
prince
andrew
who
was
moaning
.
she
knew
prince
andrew
was
in
the
same
yard
as
themselves
and
in
a
part
of
the
hut
across
the
passage
but
this
dreadful
incessant
moaning
made
her
sob
.
the
countess
exchanged
a
look
with
s6nya
.
lie
down
darling
lie
down
my
pet
said
the
countess
softly
touching
natashas
shoul
ders
.
come
lie
down
.
oh
yes

..
.
ill
lie
down
at
once
said
na
tdsha
and
began
hurriedly
undressing
tugging
at
the
tapes
of
her
petticoat
.
when
she
had
thrown
off
her
dress
and
put
on
a
dressing
jacket
she
sat
down
with
her
foot
under
her
on
the
bed
that
had
been
made
up
on
the
floor
jerked
her
thin
and
rather
short
plait
of
hair
to
the
front
and
began
re
plaiting
it
.
her
long
thin
practiced
fingers
rapidly
unplaited
replaited
and
tied
up
her
plait
.
her
head
moved
from
side
to
side
from
habit
but
her
eyes
feverishly
wide
looked
fixedly
before
her
.
when
her
toilet
for
the
night
was
finished
she
sank
gently
onto
the
sheet
spread
over
the
hay
on
the
side
nearest
the
door
.
natdsha
youd
better
lie
in
the
middle
said
s6nya
.
ill
stay
here
muttered
natdsha
.
do
lie
down
she
added
crossly
and
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
.
the
countess
madame
schoss
and
s6nya
undressed
hastily
and
lay
down
.
the
small
lamp
in
front
of
the
icons
was
the
only
light
left
in
the
room
.
but
in
the
yard
there
was
a
light
from
the
fire
at
little
mytishchi
a
mile
and
a
half
away
and
through
the
night
came
the
noise
of
people
shouting
at
a
tavern
ma
m6novs
cossacks
had
set
up
across
the
street
and
the
adjutants
unceasing
moans
could
still
be
heard
.
for
a
long
time
natdsha
listened
attentively
to
the
sounds
that
reached
her
from
inside
and
outside
the
room
and
did
not
move
.
first
she
heard
her
mother
praying
and
sighing
and
the
creaking
of
her
bed
under
her
then
madame
schoss
1
familiar
whistling
snore
and
s6nyas
gentle
breathing
.
then
the
countess
called
to
natdsha
.
natdsha
did
not
answer
.
i
think
shes
asleep
mamma
said
s6nya
softly
.
after
a
short
silence
the
countess
spoke
again
but
this
time
no
one
replied
.
soon
after
that
natdsha
heard
her
mothers
even
breathing
.
natdsha
did
not
move
though
her
little
bare
foot
thrust
out
from
under
the
quilt
was
growing
cold
on
the
bare
floor
.
as
if
to
celebrate
a
victory
over
everybody
a
cricket
chirped
in
a
crack
in
the
wall
.
a
cock
crowed
far
off
and
another
replied
near
by
.
the
shouting
in
the
tavern
had
died
down
only
the
moaning
of
the
adjutant
was
heard
.
natdsha
sat
up
.
s6nya
are
you
asleep
mamma
she
whis
pered
.
no
one
replied
.
natdsha
rose
slowly
and
care
fully
crossed
herself
and
stepped
cautiously
on
the
cold
and
dirty
floor
with
her
slim
sup
ple
bare
feet
.
the
boards
of
the
floor
creaked
.
stepping
cautiously
from
one
foot
to
the
other
she
ran
like
a
kitten
the
few
steps
to
the
door
war
and
peace
and
grasped
the
cold
door
handle
.
it
seemed
to
her
that
something
heavy
was
beating
rhythmically
against
all
the
walls
of
the
room
it
was
her
own
heart
sinking
with
alarm
and
terror
and
overflowing
with
love
.
she
opened
the
door
and
stepped
across
the
threshold
and
onto
the
cold
damp
earthen
floor
of
the
passage
.
the
cold
she
felt
refreshed
her
.
with
her
bare
feet
she
touched
a
sleeping
man
stepped
over
him
and
opened
the
door
into
the
part
of
the
hut
where
prince
andrew
lay
.
it
was
dark
in
there
.
in
the
farthest
corner
on
a
bench
beside
a
bed
on
which
something
was
lying
stood
a
tallow
candle
with
a
long
thick
and
smoldering
wick
.
from
the
moment
she
had
been
told
that
morning
of
prince
andrews
wound
and
his
presence
there
natasha
had
resolved
to
see
him
.
she
did
not
know
why
she
had
to
she
knew
the
meeting
would
be
painful
but
felt
the
more
convinced
that
it
was
necessary
.
all
day
she
had
lived
only
in
hope
of
seeing
him
that
night
.
but
now
that
the
moment
had
come
she
was
filled
with
dread
of
what
she
might
see
.
how
was
he
maimed
what
was
left
of
him
was
he
like
that
incessant
moaning
of
the
adjutants
yes
he
was
altogether
like
that
.
in
her
imagination
he
was
that
terrible
moan
ing
personified
.
when
she
saw
an
indistinct
shape
in
the
corner
and
mistook
his
knees
raised
under
the
quilt
for
his
shoulders
she
imagined
a
horrible
body
there
and
stood
still
in
terror
.
but
an
irresistible
impulse
drew
her
forward
.
she
cautiously
took
one
step
and
then
another
and
found
herself
in
the
middle
of
a
small
room
containing
baggage
.
another
man
tim6khin
was
lying
in
a
corner
on
the
benches
beneath
the
icons
and
two
others
the
doctor
and
a
valet
lay
on
the
floor
.
the
valet
sat
up
and
whispered
something
.
tim6khin
kept
awake
by
the
pain
in
his
wounded
leg
gazed
with
wideopen
eyes
at
this
strange
apparition
of
a
girl
in
a
white
chemise
dressing
jacket
and
nightcap
.
the
valets
sleepy
frightened
exclamation
what
do
you
want
whats
the
matter
made
natdsha
ap
proach
more
swiftly
to
what
was
lying
in
the
corner
.
horribly
unlike
a
man
as
that
body
looked
she
must
see
him
.
she
passed
the
valet
the
snuff
fell
from
the
candle
wick
and
she
saw
prince
andrew
clearly
with
his
arms
outside
the
quilt
and
such
as
she
had
always
seen
him
.
he
was
the
same
as
ever
but
the
feverish
color
of
his
face
his
glittering
eyes
rapturously
turned
toward
her
and
especially
his
neck
delicate
as
a
childs
revealed
by
the
turndown
collar
of
his
shirt
gave
him
a
peculiarly
inno
cent
childlike
look
such
as
she
had
never
seen
on
him
before
.
she
went
up
to
him
and
with
a
swift
flexible
youthful
movement
dropped
on
her
knees
.
he
smiled
and
held
out
his
hand
to
her
.
chapter
xxxii
seven
days
had
passed
since
prince
andrew
found
himself
in
the
ambulance
station
on
the
field
of
borodin6
.
his
feverish
state
and
the
inflammation
of
his
bowels
which
were
in
jured
were
in
the
doctors
opinion
sure
to
carry
him
off
.
but
on
the
seventh
day
he
ate
with
pleasure
a
piece
of
bread
with
some
tea
and
the
doctor
noticed
that
his
temperature
was
lower
.
he
had
regained
consciousness
that
morning
.
the
first
night
after
they
left
mos
cow
had
been
fairly
warm
and
he
had
remained
in
the
caltche
but
at
mytishchi
the
wounded
man
himself
asked
to
be
taken
out
and
given
some
tea
.
the
pain
caused
by
his
removal
into
the
hut
had
made
him
groan
aloud
and
again
lose
consciousness
.
when
he
had
been
placed
on
his
camp
bed
he
lay
for
a
long
time
motion
less
with
closed
eyes
.
then
he
opened
them
and
whispered
softly
and
the
tea
his
re
membering
such
a
small
detail
of
everyday
life
astonished
the
doctor
.
he
felt
prince
andrews
pulse
and
to
his
surprise
and
dissatisfaction
found
it
had
improved
.
he
was
dissatisfied
be
cause
he
knew
by
experience
that
if
his
patient
did
not
die
now
he
would
do
so
a
little
later
with
greater
suffering
.
tim6khin
the
rednosed
major
of
prince
andrews
regiment
had
joined
him
in
moscow
and
was
being
taken
along
with
him
having
been
wounded
in
the
leg
at
the
battleofborodin6
.
they
were
accompanied
by
a
doctor
prince
andrews
valet
his
coach
man
and
two
orderlies
.
they
gave
prince
andrew
some
tea
.
he
drank
it
eagerly
looking
with
feverish
eyes
at
the
door
in
front
of
him
as
if
trying
to
under
stand
and
remember
something
.
i
dont
want
any
more
.
is
tim6khin
here
he
asked
.
tim6khin
crept
along
the
bench
to
him
.
i
am
here
your
excellency
.
hows
your
wound
mine
sir
all
right
.
but
how
about
you
prince
andrew
again
pondered
as
if
trying
to
remember
something
.
couldnt
one
get
a
book
he
asked
.
what
book
the
gospels
.
i
havent
one
.
the
doctor
promised
to
procure
it
for
him
book
and
began
to
ask
how
he
was
feeling
.
prince
andrew
answered
all
his
questions
reluctantly
but
reasonably
and
then
said
he
wanted
a
bolster
placed
under
him
as
he
was
uncomfort
able
and
in
great
pain
.
the
doctor
and
valet
lifted
the
cloak
with
which
he
was
covered
and
making
wry
faces
at
the
noisome
smell
of
mor
tifying
flesh
that
came
from
the
wound
began
examining
that
dreadful
place
.
the
doctor
was
very
much
displeased
about
something
and
made
a
change
in
the
dressings
turning
the
wounded
man
over
so
that
he
groaned
again
and
grew
unconscious
and
delirious
from
the
agony
.
he
kept
asking
them
to
get
him
the
book
and
put
it
under
him
.
what
trouble
would
it
be
to
you
he
said
.
i
have
not
got
one
.
please
get
it
for
me
and
put
it
under
me
for
a
moment
he
pleaded
in
a
piteous
voice
.
the
doctor
went
into
the
passage
to
wash
his
hands
.
you
fellows
have
no
conscience
said
he
to
the
valet
who
was
pouring
water
over
his
hands
.
for
just
one
moment
i
didnt
look
aft
er
you

..
.
its
such
pain
you
know
that
i
wonder
how
he
can
bear
it
.
by
the
lord
jesus
christ
i
thought
we
had
put
something
under
him
said
the
valet
.
the
first
time
prince
andrew
understood
where
he
was
and
what
was
the
matter
with
him
and
remembered
being
wounded
and
how
was
when
he
asked
to
be
carried
into
the
hut
after
his
caliche
had
stopped
at
mytishchi
.
aft
er
growing
confused
from
pain
while
being
carried
into
the
hut
he
again
regained
con
sciousness
and
while
drinking
tea
once
more
recalled
all
that
had
happened
to
him
and
above
all
vividly
remembered
the
moment
at
the
ambulance
station
when
at
the
sight
of
the
sufferings
of
a
man
he
disliked
those
new
thoughts
had
come
to
him
which
promised
him
happiness
.
and
those
thoughts
though
now
vague
and
indefinite
again
possessed
his
soul
.
he
remembered
that
he
had
now
a
new
source
of
happiness
and
that
this
happiness
had
something
to
do
with
the
gospels
.
that
was
why
he
asked
for
a
copy
of
them
.
the
un
comfortable
position
in
which
they
had
put
him
and
turned
him
over
again
confused
his
thoughts
and
when
he
came
to
himself
a
third
time
it
was
in
the
complete
stillness
of
the
night
.
everybody
near
him
was
sleeping
.
a
cricket
chirped
from
across
the
passage
some
one
was
shouting
and
singing
in
the
street
cockroaches
rustled
on
the
table
on
the
icons
and
on
the
walls
and
a
big
fly
flopped
at
the
eleven
525
head
of
the
bed
and
around
the
candle
beside
him
the
wick
of
which
was
charred
and
had
shaped
itself
like
a
mushroom
.
his
mind
was
not
in
a
normal
state
.
a
healthy
man
usually
thinks
of
feels
and
re
members
innumerable
things
simultaneously
but
has
the
power
and
will
to
select
one
se
quence
of
thoughts
or
events
on
which
to
fix
his
whole
attention
.
a
healthy
man
can
tear
himself
away
from
the
deepest
reflections
to
say
a
civil
word
to
someone
who
comes
in
and
can
then
return
again
to
his
own
thoughts
.
but
prince
andrews
mind
was
not
in
a
normal
state
in
that
respect
.
all
the
powers
of
his
mind
were
more
active
and
clearer
than
ever
but
they
acted
apart
from
his
will
.
most
diverse
thoughts
and
images
occupied
him
simultane
ously
.
at
times
his
brain
suddenly
began
to
work
with
a
vigor
clearness
and
depth
it
had
never
reached
when
he
was
in
health
but
sud
denly
in
the
midst
of
its
work
it
would
turn
to
some
unexpected
idea
and
he
had
not
the
strength
to
turn
it
back
again
.
yes
a
new
happiness
was
revealed
to
me
of
which
man
cannot
be
deprived
he
thought
as
he
lay
in
the
semidarkness
of
the
quiet
hut
gazing
fixedly
before
him
with
feverish
wide
open
eyes
.
a
happiness
lying
beyond
material
forces
outside
the
material
influences
that
act
on
mana
happiness
of
the
soul
alone
the
happiness
of
loving
.
every
man
can
under
stand
it
but
to
conceive
it
and
enjoin
it
was
possible
only
for
god
.
but
how
did
god
en
join
that
law
and
why
was
the
son

.

.

.

and
suddenly
the
sequence
of
these
thoughts
broke
off
and
prince
andrew
heard
without
knowing
whether
it
was
a
delusion
or
reality
a
soft
whispering
voice
incessantly
and
rhyth
mically
repeating
pitipitipiti
and
then
ti
ti
and
then
again
pitipitipiti
and
titi
once
more
.
at
the
same
time
he
felt
that
above
his
face
above
the
very
middle
of
it
some
strange
airy
structure
was
being
erected
out
of
slender
needles
or
splinters
to
the
sound
of
this
whispered
music
.
he
felt
that
he
had
to
balance
carefully
though
it
was
difficult
so
that
this
airy
structure
should
not
collapse
but
nevertheless
it
kept
collapsing
and
again
slow
ly
rising
to
the
sound
of
whispered
rhythmic
music
it
stretches
stretches
spreading
out
and
stretching
said
prince
andrew
to
him
self
.
while
listening
to
this
whispering
and
feeling
the
sensation
of
this
drawing
out
and
the
construction
of
this
edifice
of
needles
he
also
saw
by
glimpses
a
red
halo
round
the
candle
and
heard
the
rustle
of
the
cockroaches
526
war
and
peace
and
the
buzzing
of
the
fly
that
flopped
against
his
pillow
and
his
face
.
each
time
the
fly
touched
his
face
it
gave
him
a
burning
sensa
tion
and
yet
to
his
surprise
it
did
not
destroy
the
structure
though
it
knocked
against
the
very
region
of
his
face
where
it
was
rising
.
but
besides
this
there
was
something
else
of
im
portance
.
it
was
something
white
by
the
door
the
statue
of
a
sphinx
which
also
oppressed
him
.
but
perhaps
thats
my
shirt
on
the
table
he
thought
and
thats
my
legs
and
that
is
the
door
but
why
is
it
always
stretching
and
drawing
itself
out
and
pitipitipiti
and
titi
and
pitipitipiti

.

.

.

thats
enough
please
leave
off
prince
andrew
painfully
entreated
someone
.
and
suddenly
thoughts
and
feelings
again
swam
to
the
surface
of
his
mind
with
peculiar
clearness
and
force
.
yes
love
he
thought
again
quite
clearly
.
but
not
love
which
loves
for
something
for
some
quality
for
some
purpose
or
for
some
reason
but
the
love
which
i
while
dying
first
experienced
when
i
saw
my
enemy
and
yet
loved
him
.
i
experienced
that
feeling
of
love
which
is
the
very
essence
of
the
soul
and
does
not
require
an
object
.
now
again
i
feel
that
bliss
.
to
love
ones
neighbors
to
love
ones
enemies
to
love
everything
to
love
god
in
all
his
manifestations
.
it
is
possible
to
love
someone
dear
to
you
with
human
love
but
an
enemy
can
only
be
loved
by
divine
love
.
that
is
why
i
experienced
such
joy
when
i
felt
that
i
loved
that
man
.
what
has
become
of
him
is
he
alive

.

.

.
when
loving
with
human
love
one
may
pass
from
love
to
hatred
but
divine
love
can
not
change
.
no
neither
death
nor
anything
else
can
destroy
it
.
it
is
the
very
essence
of
the
soul
.
yet
how
many
people
have
i
hated
in
my
life
and
of
them
all
i
loved
and
hated
none
as
i
did
her
.
and
he
vividly
pictured
to
him
self
natdsha
not
as
he
had
done
in
the
past
with
nothing
but
her
charms
which
gave
him
delight
but
for
the
first
time
picturing
to
him
self
her
soul
.
and
he
understood
her
feelings
her
sufferings
shame
and
remorse
.
he
now
understood
for
the
first
time
all
the
cruelty
of
his
rejection
of
her
the
cruelty
of
his
rupture
with
her
.
if
only
it
were
possible
for
me
to
see
her
once
more
just
once
looking
into
those
eyes
to
say

.

.

.
pitipitipiti
and
titi
and
pitipitipiti
boom
flopped
the
fly
.

..
.
and
his
attention
was
suddenly
carried
into
another
world
a
world
of
reality
and
delirium
in
which
some
thing
particular
was
happening
.
in
that
world
some
structure
was
still
being
erected
and
did
not
fall
something
was
still
stretching
out
and
the
candle
with
its
red
halo
was
still
burning
and
the
same
shir
tl
ike
sphinx
lay
near
the
door
but
besides
all
this
something
creaked
there
was
a
whiff
of
fresh
air
and
a
new
white
sphinx
appeared
standing
at
the
door
.
and
that
sphinx
had
the
pale
face
and
shining
eyes
of
the
very
natdsha
of
whom
he
had
just
been
thinking
.
oh
how
oppressive
this
continual
delirium
is
thought
prince
andrew
trying
to
drive
that
face
from
his
imagination
.
but
the
face
remained
before
him
with
the
force
of
reality
and
drew
nearer
.
prince
andrew
wished
to
re
turn
to
that
former
world
of
pure
thought
but
he
could
not
and
delirium
drew
him
back
into
its
domain
.
the
soft
whispering
voice
con
tinued
its
rhythmic
murmur
something
op
pressed
him
and
stretched
out
and
the
strange
face
was
before
him
.
prince
andrew
collected
all
his
strength
in
an
effort
to
recover
his
senses
he
moved
a
little
and
suddenly
there
was
a
ringing
in
his
ears
a
dimness
in
his
eyes
and
like
a
man
plunged
into
water
he
lost
con
sciousness
.
when
he
came
to
himself
natdsha
that
same
living
natdsha
whom
of
all
people
he
most
longed
to
love
wtih
this
new
pure
divine
love
that
had
been
revealed
to
him
was
kneeling
before
him
.
he
realized
that
it
was
the
real
living
natdsha
and
he
was
not
sur
prised
but
quietly
happy
.
natdsha
motionless
on
her
knees
she
was
unable
to
stir
with
frightened
eyes
riveted
on
him
was
restraining
her
sobs
.
her
face
was
pale
and
rigid
.
only
in
the
lower
part
of
it
something
quivered
.
prince
andrew
sighed
with
relief
smiled
and
held
out
his
hand
.
you
he
said
.
how
fortunatel
with
a
rapid
but
careful
movement
natdsha
drew
nearer
to
him
on
her
knees
and
taking
his
hand
carefully
bent
her
face
over
it
and
began
kissing
it
just
touching
it
lightly
with
her
lips
.
forgive
me
she
whispered
raising
her
head
and
glancing
at
him
.
forgive
me
i
love
you
said
prince
andrew
.
forgive

..
.
i
forgive
what
he
asked
.
forgive
me
for
what
i
have
done
fal
tered
natdsha
in
a
scarcely
audible
broken
whisper
and
began
kissing
his
hand
more
rapidly
just
touching
it
with
her
lips
.
i
love
you
more
better
than
before
said
prince
andrew
lifting
her
face
with
his
hand
book
eleven
527
so
as
to
look
into
her
eyes
.
those
eyes
filled
with
happy
tears
gazed
at
him
timidly
compassionately
and
with
joyous
love
.
natashas
thin
pale
face
with
its
swollen
lips
was
more
than
plain
it
was
dreadful
.
but
prince
andrew
did
not
see
that
he
saw
her
shining
eyes
which
were
beautiful
.
they
heard
the
sound
of
voices
behind
them
.
peter
the
valet
who
was
now
wide
awake
had
roused
the
doctor
.
tim6khin
who
had
not
slept
at
all
because
of
the
pain
in
his
leg
had
long
been
watching
all
that
was
going
on
care
fully
covering
his
bare
body
with
the
sheet
as
he
huddled
up
on
his
bench
.
whats
this
said
the
doctor
rising
from
his
bed
.
please
go
away
madam
at
that
moment
a
maid
sent
by
the
countess
who
had
noticed
her
daughters
absence
knocked
at
the
door
.
like
a
somnambulist
aroused
from
her
sleep
natasha
went
out
of
the
room
and
returning
to
her
hut
fell
sobbing
on
her
bed
.
from
that
time
during
all
the
rest
of
the
rostovs
journey
at
every
halting
place
and
wherever
they
spent
a
night
natdsha
never
left
the
wounded
bolk6nski
and
the
doctor
had
to
admit
that
he
had
not
expected
from
a
young
girl
either
such
firmness
or
such
skill
in
nursing
a
wounded
man
.
dreadful
as
the
countess
imagined
it
would
be
should
prince
andrew
die
in
her
daughters
arms
during
the
journey
as
judging
by
what
the
doctor
said
it
seemed
might
easily
happen
she
could
not
oppose
natasha
.
though
with
the
intimacy
now
established
between
the
wounded
man
and
natasha
the
thought
oc
curred
that
should
he
recover
their
former
en
gagement
would
be
renewed
no
one
least
of
all
natasha
and
prince
andrew
spoke
of
this
the
unsettled
question
of
life
and
death
which
hung
not
only
over
bolk6nski
but
over
all
russia
shut
out
all
other
considerations
.
chapter
xxxiii
on
the
third
of
september
pierre
awoke
late
.
his
head
was
aching
the
clothes
in
which
he
had
slept
without
undressing
felt
uncomfort
able
on
his
body
and
his
mind
had
a
dim
con
sciousness
of
something
shameful
he
had
done
the
day
before
.
that
something
shameful
was
his
yesterdays
conversation
with
captain
ram
balle
.
it
was
eleven
by
the
clock
but
it
seemed
peculiarly
dark
out
of
doors
.
pierre
rose
rubbed
his
eyes
and
seeing
the
pistol
with
an
engraved
stock
which
gerasim
had
replaced
on
the
writing
table
he
remembered
where
he
was
and
what
lay
before
him
that
very
day
.
am
i
not
too
late
he
thought
.
no
prob
ably
he
wont
make
his
entry
into
moscow
be
fore
noon
.
pierre
did
not
allow
himself
to
reflect
on
what
lay
before
him
but
hastened
to
act
.
after
arranging
his
clothes
he
took
the
pis
tol
and
was
about
to
go
out
.
but
it
then
oc
curred
to
him
for
the
first
time
that
he
certain
ly
could
not
carry
the
weapon
in
his
hand
through
the
streets
.
it
was
difficult
to
hide
such
a
big
pistol
even
under
his
wide
coat
.
he
could
not
carry
it
unnoticed
in
his
belt
or
under
his
arm
.
besides
it
had
been
discharged
and
he
had
not
had
time
to
reload
it
.
no
matter
the
dagger
will
do
he
said
to
himself
though
when
planning
his
design
he
had
more
than
once
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
chief
mistake
made
by
the
student
in
1809
had
been
to
try
to
kill
napoleon
with
a
dagger
.
but
as
his
chief
aim
consisted
not
in
carrying
out
his
design
but
in
proving
to
himself
that
he
would
not
abandon
his
intention
and
was
doing
all
he
could
to
achieve
it
pierre
hastily
took
the
blunt
jagged
dagger
in
a
green
sheath
which
he
had
bought
at
the
sukharev
market
with
the
pistol
and
hid
it
under
his
waistcoat
.
having
tied
a
girdle
over
his
coat
and
pulled
his
cap
low
on
his
head
pierre
went
down
the
corridor
trying
to
avoid
making
a
noise
or
meeting
the
captain
and
passed
out
into
the
street
.
the
conflagration
at
which
he
had
looked
with
so
much
indifference
the
evening
before
had
greatly
increased
during
the
night
.
mos
cow
was
on
fire
in
several
places
.
the
build
ings
in
carriage
row
across
the
river
in
the
bazaar
and
the
povarsk6y
as
well
as
the
barges
on
the
moskva
river
and
the
timber
yards
by
the
dorogomflov
bridge
were
all
ablaze
.
pierres
way
led
through
side
streets
to
the
povarskoy
and
from
there
to
the
church
of
st
.
nicholas
on
the
arbat
where
he
had
long
be
fore
decided
that
the
deed
should
be
done
.
the
gates
of
most
of
the
houses
were
locked
and
the
shutters
up
.
the
streets
and
lanes
were
deserted
.
the
air
was
full
of
smoke
and
the
smell
of
burning
.
now
and
then
he
met
rus
sians
with
anxious
and
timid
faces
and
french
men
with
an
air
not
of
the
city
but
of
the
camp
walking
in
the
middle
of
the
streets
.
both
the
russians
and
the
french
looked
at
pierre
with
surprise
.
besides
his
height
and
stoutness
and
the
strange
morose
look
of
suf
58
fering
in
his
face
and
whole
figure
the
rus
sians
stared
at
him
because
they
could
not
make
out
to
what
class
he
could
belong
.
the
french
followed
him
with
astonishment
in
their
eyes
chiefly
because
pierre
unlike
all
the
other
rus
sians
who
gazed
at
the
french
with
fear
and
curiosity
paid
no
attention
to
them
.
at
the
gate
of
one
house
three
frenchmen
who
were
explaining
something
to
some
russians
who
did
not
understand
them
stopped
pierre
ask
ing
if
he
did
not
know
french
.
pierre
shook
his
head
and
went
on
.
in
an
other
side
street
a
sentinel
standing
beside
a
green
caisson
shouted
at
him
but
only
when
the
shout
was
threateningly
repeated
and
he
heard
the
click
of
the
mans
musket
as
he
raised
it
did
pierre
understand
that
he
had
to
pass
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
.
he
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
of
what
went
on
around
him
.
he
carried
his
resolution
within
himself
in
terror
and
haste
like
something
dreadful
and
alien
to
him
for
after
the
previ
ous
nights
experience
he
was
afraid
of
losing
it
.
but
he
was
not
destined
to
bring
his
mood
safely
to
his
destination
.
and
even
had
he
not
been
hindered
by
anything
on
the
way
his
intention
could
not
now
have
been
carried
out
for
napoleon
had
passed
the
arbat
more
than
four
hours
previously
on
his
way
from
the
do
rogomflov
suburb
to
the
kremlin
and
was
now
sitting
in
a
very
gloomy
frame
of
mind
in
a
royal
study
in
the
kremlin
giving
detailed
and
exact
orders
as
to
measures
to
be
taken
im
mediately
to
extinguish
the
fire
to
prevent
looting
and
to
reassure
the
inhabitants
.
but
pierre
did
not
know
this
he
was
entirely
ab
sorbed
in
what
lay
before
him
and
was
tor
turedas
those
are
who
obstinately
undertake
a
task
that
is
impossible
for
them
not
because
of
its
difficulty
but
because
of
its
incompati
bility
with
their
natures
by
the
fear
of
weaken
ing
at
the
decisive
moment
and
so
losing
his
selfesteem
.
though
he
heard
and
saw
nothing
around
him
he
found
his
way
by
instinct
and
did
not
go
wrong
in
the
side
streets
that
led
to
the
povarsk6y
.
as
pierre
approached
that
street
the
smoke
became
denser
and
denser
he
even
felt
the
heat
of
the
fire
.
occasionally
curly
tongues
of
flame
rose
from
under
the
roofs
of
the
houses
.
he
met
more
people
in
the
streets
and
they
were
more
excited
.
but
pierre
though
he
felt
that
something
unusual
was
happening
around
him
did
not
realize
that
he
was
approaching
the
fire
.
as
he
was
going
along
a
footpath
across
war
and
peace
a
wideopen
space
adjoining
the
povarsk6y
on
one
side
and
the
gardens
of
prince
gruzfnskis
house
on
the
other
pierre
suddenly
heard
the
desperate
weeping
of
a
woman
close
to
him
.
he
stopped
as
if
awakening
from
a
dream
and
lifted
his
head
.
by
the
side
of
the
path
on
the
dusty
dry
grass
all
sorts
of
household
goods
lay
in
a
heap

feather
beds
a
samovar
icons
and
trunks
.
on
the
ground
beside
the
trunks
sat
a
thin
woman
no
longer
young
with
long
prominent
upper
teeth
and
wearing
a
black
cloak
and
cap
.
this
woman
swaying
to
and
fro
and
mut
tering
something
was
choking
with
sobs
.
two
girls
of
about
ten
and
twelve
dressed
in
dirty
short
frocks
and
cloaks
were
staring
at
their
mother
with
a
look
of
stupefaction
on
their
pale
frightened
faces
.
the
youngest
child
a
boy
of
about
seven
who
wore
an
overcoat
and
an
immense
cap
evidently
not
his
own
was
crying
in
his
old
nurses
arms
.
a
dirty
bare
footed
maid
was
sitting
on
a
trunk
and
hav
ing
undone
her
palecolored
plait
was
pulling
it
straight
and
sniffing
at
her
singed
hair
.
the
womans
husband
a
short
roundshouldered
man
in
the
undress
uniform
of
a
civilian
of
ficial
with
sausageshaped
whiskers
and
show
ing
under
his
squareset
cap
the
hair
smoothly
brushed
forward
over
his
temples
with
ex
pressionless
face
was
moving
the
trunks
which
were
placed
one
on
another
and
was
dragging
some
garments
from
under
them
.
as
soon
as
she
saw
pierre
the
woman
almost
threw
herself
at
his
feet
.

her

to

in

evidently
only
to
justify

before

added

the
woman
an
grily
suddenly
ceasing
to
weep
.

she
went
on
addressing
pierre
rapidly
between
her
sobs
.
the
fire
broke
out
along
side
and
blew
our
way
the
maid
called
out
tire
and
we
rushed
to
collect
our
things
.
we
ran
out
just
as
we
were

and
again
she
began
to
sob
.
my

dear
one

but
where
was
she
left
asked
pierre
.
from
the
expression
of
his
animated
face
the
woman
saw
that
this
man
might
help
her
.
oh
dear
sir
she
cried
seizing
him
by
the
legs
.
my
benefactor
set
my
heart
at
ease
.

.

.

.
anfskago

she
cried
to
the
maid
angrily
opening
her
mouth
and
still
farther
exposing
her
long
teeth
.
show

the
way
show

i

..
.
ill
do
it
gasped
pierre
rapidly
.
the
dirty
maidservant
stepped
from
behind
the
trunk
put
up
her
plait
sighed
and
went
on
her
short
bare
feet
along
the
path
.
pierre
felt
as
if
he
had
come
back
to
life
after
a
heavy
swoon
.
he
held
his
head
higher
his
eyes
shone
with
the
light
of
life
and
with
swift
steps
he
followed
the
maid
overtook
her
and
came
out
on
the
povarsk6y
.
the
whole
street
was
full
of
clouds
of
black
smoke
.
tongues
of
flame
here
and
there
broke
through
that
cloud
.
a
great
number
of
people
crowded
in
front
of
the
con
flagration
.
in
the
middle
of
the
street
stood
a
french
general
saying
something
to
those
around
him
.
pierre
accompanied
by
the
maid
was
advancing
to
the
spot
where
the
general
stood
but
the
french
soldiers
stopped
him
.
on
ne
passe

cried
a
voice
.
this
way
uncle
cried
the
girl
.
well
pass
through
the
side
street
by
the
nikulinsi
pierre
turned
back
giving
a
spring
now
and
then
to
keep
up
with
her
.
she
ran
across
the
street
turned
down
a
side
street
to
the
left
and
passing
three
houses
turned
into
a
yard
on
the
right
.
its
here
close
by
said
she
and
running
across
the
yard
opened
a
gate
in
a
wooden
fence
and
stopping
pointed
out
to
him
a
small
wooden
wing
of
the
house
which
was
burning
brightly
and
fiercely
.
one
of
its
sides
had
fallen
in
another
was
on
fire
and
bright
flames
issued
from
the
openings
of
the
windows
and
from
under
the
roof
.
as
pierre
passed
through
the
fence
gate
he
was
enveloped
by
hot
air
and
involuntarily
stopped
.
which
is
it
which
is
your
house
he
asked
.
ooh
wailed
the
girl
pointing
to
the
wing
.
thats
it
that
was
our
lodging
.
youve
burned
10
you
cant
pass
to
death
our
treasure
katie
my
precious
little
missy
ooh
lamented
aniska
who
at
the
sight
of
the
fire
felt
that
she
too
must
give
ex
pression
to
her
feelings
.
pierre
rushed
to
the
wing
but
the
heat
was
so
great
that
he
involuntarily
passed
round
in
a
curve
and
came
upon
the
large
house
that
was
as
yet
burning
only
at
one
end
just
below
the
roof
and
around
which
swarmed
a
crowd
of
frenchmen
.
at
first
pierre
did
not
realize
what
these
men
who
were
dragging
something
out
were
about
but
seeing
before
him
a
frenchman
hitting
a
peasant
with
a
blunt
sa
ber
and
trying
to
take
from
him
a
foxfur
coat
he
vaguely
understood
that
looting
was
going
on
there
but
he
had
no
time
to
dwell
on
that
idea
.
the
sounds
of
crackling
and
the
din
of
fall
ing
walls
and
ceilings
the
whistle
and
hiss
of
the
flames
the
excited
shouts
of
the
people
and
the
sight
of
the
swayingsmoke
now
gather
ing
into
thick
black
clouds
and
now
soaring
up
with
glittering
sparks
with
here
and
there
dense
sheaves
of
flame
now
red
and
now
like
golden
fish
scales
creeping
along
the
walls
and
the
heat
and
smoke
and
rapidity
of
mo
tion
produced
on
pierre
the
usual
animating
effects
of
a
conflagration
.
it
had
a
peculiarly
strong
effect
on
him
because
at
the
sight
of
the
fire
he
felt
himself
suddenly
freed
from
the
ideas
that
had
weighed
him
down
.
he
felt
young
bright
adroit
and
resolute
.
he
ran
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
lodge
and
was
about
to
dash
into
that
part
of
it
which
was
still
standing
when
just
above
his
head
he
heard
several
voices
shouting
and
then
a
crack
ing
sound
and
the
ring
of
something
heavy
falling
close
beside
him
.
pierre
looked
up
and
saw
at
a
window
of
the
large
house
some
frenchmen
who
had
just
thrown
out
the
drawer
of
a
chest
filled
with
metal
articles
.
other
french
soldiers
standing
below
went
up
to
the
drawer
.
what
does
this
fellow
want
shouted
one
of
them
referring
to
pierre
.
theres
a
child
in
that
house
.
havent
you
seen
a
child
cried
pierre
.
whats
he
talking
about
get
along
said
several
voices
and
one
of
the
soldiers
evident
ly
afraid
that
pierre
might
want
to
take
from
them
some
of
the
plate
and
bronzes
that
were
in
the
drawer
moved
threateningly
toward
him
.
a
child
shouted
a
frenchman
fromabove
.
i
did
hear
something
squealing
in
the
garden
.
perhaps
its
his
brat
that
the
fellow
is

for

after
all

know

.
where
is
it
where
said
pierre
.
there
there
shouted
the
frenchman
at
the
window
pointing
to
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
wait
a
bit
im
coming
down
.
and
a
minute
or
two
later
the
frenchman
a
blackeyed
fellow
with
a
spot
on
his
cheek
in
shirt
sleeves
really
did
jump
out
of
a
window
on
the
ground
floor
and
clapping
pierre
on
the
shoulder
ran
with
him
into
the
garden
.
hurry
up
you
others
he
called
out
to
his
comrades
.
its
getting
hot
.
when
they
reached
a
gravel
path
behind
the
house
the
frenchman
pulled
pierre
by
the
arm
and
pointed
to
a
round
graveled
space
where
a
threeyearold
girl
in
a
pink
dress
was
lying
under
a
seat
.
there
is
your
child
oh
a
girl
so
much
the
better
said
the
frenchman
.
goodby
fatty
.
we
must
be
human
we
are
all
mortal
you
know
and
the
frenchman
with
the
spot
on
his
cheek
ran
back
to
his
comrades
.
breathless
with
joy
pierre
ran
to
the
little
girl
and
was
going
to
take
her
in
his
arms
.
but
seeing
a
stranger
the
sickly
scrofulouslooking
child
unattractively
like
her
mother
began
to
yell
and
run
away
.
pierre
however
seized
her
and
lifted
her
in
his
arms
.
she
screamed
des
perately
and
angrily
and
tried
with
her
little
hands
to
pull
pierres
hands
away
and
to
bite
them
with
her
slobbering
mouth
.
pierre
was
seized
by
a
sense
of
horror
and
repulsion
such
as
he
had
experienced
when
touching
some
nasty
little
animal
.
but
he
made
an
effort
not
to
throw
the
child
down
and
ran
with
her
to
the
large
house
.
it
was
now
however
impossi
ble
to
get
back
the
way
he
had
come
the
maid
anfska
was
no
longer
there
and
pierre
with
a
feeling
of
pity
and
disgust
pressed
the
wet
painfully
sobbing
child
to
himself
as
tenderly
as
he
could
and
ran
with
her
through
the
gar
den
seeking
another
way
out
.
chapter
xxxiv
having
run
through
different
yards
and
side
streets
pierre
got
back
with
his
little
burden
to
the
gruzfnski
garden
at
the
corner
of
the
povarsk6y
.
he
did
not
at
first
recognize
the
place
from
which
he
had
set
out
to
look
for
the
child
so
crowded
was
it
now
with
people
and
goods
that
had
been
dragged
out
of
the
houses
.
besides
russian
families
who
had
taken
refuge
here
from
the
fire
with
their
belongings
there
were
several
french
soldiers
in
a
variety
of
clothing
.
pierre
took
no
notice
of
them
.
he
war
and
peace
hurried
to
find
the
family
of
that
civil
servant
in
order
to
restore
the
daughter
to
her
mother
and
go
to
save
someone
else
.
pierre
felt
that
he
had
still
much
to
do
and
to
do
quickly
.
glow
ing
with
the
heat
and
from
running
he
felt
at
that
moment
more
strongly
than
ever
the
sense
of
youth
animation
and
determination
that
had
come
on
him
when
he
ran
to
save
the
child
.
she
had
now
become
quiet
and
clinging
with
her
little
hands
to
pierres
coat
sat
on
his
arm
gazing
about
her
like
some
little
wild
ani
mal
.
he
glanced
at
her
occasionally
with
a
slight
smile
.
he
fancied
he
saw
something
pathetically
innocent
in
that
frightened
sickly
little
face
.
he
did
not
find
the
civil
servant
or
his
wife
where
he
had
left
them
.
he
walked
among
the
crowd
with
rapid
steps
scanning
the
various
faces
he
met
.
involuntarily
he
noticed
a
geor
gian
or
armenian
family
consisting
of
a
very
handsome
old
man
of
oriental
type
wearing
a
new
clothcovered
sheepskin
coat
and
new
boots
an
old
woman
of
similar
type
and
a
young
woman
.
that
very
young
woman
seemed
to
pierre
the
perfection
of
oriental
beauty
with
her
sharply
outlined
arched
black
eye
brows
and
the
extraordinarily
soft
bright
col
or
of
her
long
beautiful
expressionless
face
.
amid
the
scattered
property
and
the
crowd
on
the
open
space
she
in
her
rich
satin
cloak
with
a
bright
lilac
shawl
on
her
head
suggested
a
delicate
exotic
plant
thrown
out
onto
the
snow
.
she
was
sitting
on
some
bundles
a
little
behind
the
old
woman
and
looked
from
un
der
her
long
lashes
with
motionless
large
al
mondshaped
eyes
at
the
ground
before
her
.
evidently
she
was
aware
of
her
beauty
and
fearful
because
of
it
.
her
face
struck
pierre
and
hurrying
along
by
the
fence
he
turned
several
times
to
look
at
her
.
when
he
had
reached
the
fence
still
without
finding
those
he
sought
he
stopped
and
looked
about
him
.
with
the
child
in
his
arms
his
figure
was
now
more
conspicuous
than
before
and
a
group
of
russians
both
men
and
women
gathered
about
him
.
have
you
lost
anyone
my
dear
fellow
youre
of
the
gentry
yourself
arent
you
whose
child
is
it
they
asked
him
.
pierre
replied
that
the
child
belonged
to
a
woman
in
a
black
coat
who
had
been
sitting
there
with
her
other
children
and
he
asked
whether
anyone
knew
where
she
had
gone
.
why
that
must
be
the
anferovs
said
an
old
deacon
addressing
a
pockmarked
peasant
woman
.

he
added
in
his
customary
bass
.
the
anfrovsno
said
the
woman
.
they
left
in
the
morning
.
that

or

says
a
woman
and

a
house
serf
.

shes

with
long
teeth
said
pierre
.
thats
mary
nikoldevna
they
went
in
side
the
garden
when
these
wolves
swooped
down
said
the
woman
pointing
tothefrench
soldiers
.
o
lord
have
mercy
added
the
deacon
.
go
over
that
way
theyre
there
.
its
shel
she
kept
on
lamenting
and
crying
continued
the
woman
.
its
she
.
here
this
way
but
pierre
was
not
listening
to
the
woman
.
he
had
for
some
seconds
been
intently
watch
ing
what
was
going
on
a
few
steps
away
.
he
was
looking
at
the
armenian
family
and
at
two
french
soldiers
who
had
gone
up
to
them
.
one
of
these
a
nimble
little
man
was
wearing
a
blue
coat
tied
round
the
waist
with
a
rope
.
he
had
a
nightcap
on
his
head
and
his
feet
were
bare
.
the
other
whose
appearance
par
ticularly
struck
pierre
was
a
long
lank
round
shouldered
fairhaired
man
slow
in
his
move
ments
and
with
an
idiotic
expression
of
face
.
he
wore
a
womans
loose
gown
of
frieze
blue
trousers
and
large
torn
hessian
boots
.
the
little
barefooted
frenchman
in
the
blue
coat
went
up
to
the
armenians
and
saying
some
thing
immediately
seized
the
old
man
by
his
legs
and
the
old
man
at
once
began
pulling
off
his
boots
.
the
other
in
the
frieze
gown
stopped
in
front
of
the
beautiful
armenian
girl
and
with
his
hctnds
in
his
pockets
stood
staring
at
her
motionless
and
silent
.
here
take
the
child
said
pierre
peremp
torily
and
hurriedly
to
the
woman
handing
the
little
girl
to
her
.
give
her
back
to
them
give
her
back
he
almost
shouted
putting
the
child
who
began
screaming
on
the
ground
and
again
looking
at
the
frenchman
and
the
armenian
family
.
the
old
man
was
already
sitting
barefoot
.
the
little
frenchman
had
secured
his
second
boot
and
was
slapping
one
boot
against
the
other
.
the
old
man
was
saying
something
in
a
voice
broken
by
sobs
but
pierre
caught
but
a
glimpse
of
this
his
whole
attention
was
di
rected
to
the
frenchman
in

from

had
seized

by

the
beautiful
armenian
still
sat
motionless
and
in
the
same
attitude
with
her
long
lashes
drooping
as
if
she
did
not
see
or
feel
what
the
soldier
was
doing
to
her
.
while
pierre
was
running
the
few
steps
that
separated
him
from
the
frenchman
the
tall
marauder
in
the
frieze
gown
was
already
tear
ing
from
her
neck
the
necklace
the
young
armenian
was
wearing
and
the
young
wom
an
clutching
at
her
neck
screamed
pierc
ingly
.
let
that
woman
alone
exclaimed
pierre
hoarsely
in
a
furious
voice
seizing
the
soldier
by
his
round
shoulders
and
throwing
him
aside
.
the
soldier
fell
got
up
and
ran
away
.
but
his
comrade
throwing
down
the
boots
and
drawing
his
sword
moved
threateningly
to
ward
pierre
.

he
cried
.
pierre
was
in
such
a
transport
of
rage
that
he
remembered
nothing
and
his
strength
in
creased
tenfold
.
he
rushed
at
the
barefooted
frenchman
and
before
the
latter
had
time
to
draw
his
sword
knocked
him
off
his
feet
and
hammered
him
with
his
fists
.
shouts
of
ap
proval
were
heard
from
the
crowd
around
and
at
the
same
moment
a
mounted
patrol
of
french
uhlans
appeared
from
round
the
corner
.
the
uhlans
came
up
at
a
trot
to
pierre
and
the
frenchman
and
surrounded
them
.
pierre
re
membered
nothing
of
what
happened
after
that
.
he
only
remembered
beating
someone
and
being
beaten
and
finally
feeling
that
his
hands
were
bound
and
that
a
crowd
of
french
soldters
stood
around
him
and
were
searching
him
.
lieutenant
he
has
a
dagger
were
the
first
words
pierre
understood
.
ah
a
weapon
said
the
officer
and
turned
to
the
barefooted
soldier
who
had
been
ar
rested
with
pierre
.
all
right
you
can
tell
all
about
it
at
the
courtmartial
.
then
he
turned
to
pierre
.
do
you
speak
french
pierre
looked
around
him
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
did
not
reply
.
his
face
probably
looked
very
terrible
for
the
officer
said
something
in
a
whisper
and
four
more
uhlans
left
the
ranks
and
placed
themselves
on
both
sides
of
pierre
.
do
you
speak

the
officer
asked
again
keeping
at
a
distance
from
pierre
.

a

at
once
knew
him
to
be

from
one
of

shops
.
he
does
not
look
like
a
common
man
said
the
interpreter
after
a
searching
look
at
pierre
.
ah
he
looks
very
much
like
an
incendiary
remarked
the
officer
.
and
ask
him
who
he
is
he
added
.
who
are
you
asked
the

in

must
answer

.

pierre
suddenly
replied
in
french
.
ah
ah
muttered
the
officer
with
a
frown
.
well
then

a
crowd
had
collected
round
the
uhlans
.
nearest
to
pierre
stood
the
pockmarked

with
the
little
girl
and
when
the
patrol
started
she
moved
forward
.

said
she
.
and
the

the

what

said
the
woman
.
what

want
asked
the
officer
.
pierre
was
as
if
intoxicated
.
his
elation
in
creased
at
the
sight
of
the
little
girl
he
had
saved
.
what
does
she
want
he
murmured
.
she
is
bringing
me
my
daughter
whom
i
have
just
saved
from
the
flames
said
he
.
goodby
and
without
knowing
how
this
aimless
lie
had
escaped
him
he
went
along
with
resolute
and
triumphant
steps
between
the
french
soldiers
.
the
french
patrol
was
one
of
those
sent
out
through
the
various
streets
of
moscow
by
du
rosnels
order
to
put
a
stop
to
the
pillage
and
especially
to
catch
the
incendiaries
who
ac
cording
to
the
general
opinion
which
had
that
day
originated
among
the
higher
french
officers
were
the
cause
of
the
conflagrations
.
after
marching
through
a
number
of
streets
the
patrol
arrested
five
more
russian
suspects
a
small
shopkeeper
two
seminary
students
a
peasant
and
a
house
serf
besides
several
looters
.
but
of
all
these
various
suspected
characters
pierre
was
considered
to
be
the
most
suspicious
of
all
.
when
they
had
all
been
brought
for
the
night
to
a
large
house
on
the
zubov
rampart
that
was
being
used
as
a
guardhouse
pierre
was
placed
apart
under
strict
guard
.

in
petersburg
at
that
time
a
complicated
struggle
was
being
carried
on
with
greater
heat
than
ever
in
the
highest
circles
between
the
parties
of

the
french
marya
fe
dorovna
the
tsarvich
and
others
drowned
as
usual
by
the
buzzing
of
the
court
drones
.
but
the
calm
luxurious
life
of
petersburg
con
cerned
only
about
phantoms
and
reflections
of
real
life
went
on
in
its
old
way
and
made
it
hard
except
by
a
great
effort
to
realize
the
danger
and
the
difficult
position
of
the
rus
sian
people
.
there
were
the
same
receptions
and
balls
the
same
french
theater
the
same
court
interests
and
service
interests
and
in
trigues
as
usual
.
only
in
the
very
highest
cir
cles
were
attempts
made
to
keep
in
mind
the
difficulties
of
the
actual
position
.
stories
were
whispered
of
how
differently
the
two
empresses
behaved
in
these
difficult
circumstances
.
the
empress
marya
concerned
for
the
welfare
of
the
charitable
and
educational
institutions
un
der
her
patronage
had
given
directions
that
they
should
all
be
removed
to
kazdn
and
the
things
belonging
to
these
institutions
had
al
ready
been
packed
up
.
the
empress
elisabeth
however
when
asked
what
instructions
she
would
be
pleased
to
give
with
her
characteris
tic
russian
patriotism
had
replied
that
she
could
give
no
directions
about
state
institu
tions
for
that
was
the
affair
of
the
sovereign
but
as
far
as
she
personally
was
concerned
she
would
be
the
last
to
quit
petersburg
.
at
anna
pavlovnas
on
the
twentysixth
of
august
the
very
day
of
the
battle
of
borodin6
there
was
a
soiree
the
chief
feature
of
which
was
to
be
the
reading
of
a
letter
from
his
lord
ship
the
bishop
when
sending
the
emperor
an
icon
of
the
venerable
sergius
.
it
was
re
garded
af
a
model
of
ecclesiastical
patriotic
eloquence
.
prince
vasili
himself
famed
for
his
elocution
was
to
read
it
.
he
used
to
read
at
the
empress
.
the
art
of
his
reading
was
sup
posed
to
lie
in
rolling
out
the
words
quite
in
dependently
of
their
meaning
in
a
loud
and
singsong
voice
alternating
between
a
despair
ing
wail
and
a
tender
murmur
so
that
the
wail
fell
quite
at
random
on
one
word
and
the
murmur
on
another
.
this
reading
as
was
al
ways
the
case
at
anna
pavlovnas
soirees
had
a
political
significance
.
that
evening
she
ex
pected
several
important
personages
who
had
to
be
made
ashamed
of
their
visits
to
the
french
theater
and
aroused
to
a
patriotic
temper
.
a
good
many
people
had
already
arrived
but
anna
pavlovna
not
yet
seeing
all
those
whom
she
wanted
in
her
drawing
room
did
not
let
the
reading
begin
but
wound
up
the
springs
of
a
general
conversation
.
the
news
of
the
day
in
petersburg
was
the
illness
of
countess
bezukhova
.
she
had
fallen
ill
unexpectedly
a
few
days
previously
had
missed
several
gatherings
of
which
she
was
usually
the
ornament
and
was
said
to
be
receiv
ing
no
one
and
instead
of
the
celebrated
pe
tersburg
doctors
who
usually
attended
her
had
entrusted
herself
to
some
italian
doctor
who
was
treating
her
in
some
new
and
unusual
way
.
they
all
knew
very
well
that
the
enchanting
countess
illness
arose
from
an
inconvenience
resulting
from
marrying
two
husbands
at
the
same
time
and
that
the
italians
cure
consist
ed
in
removing
such
inconvenience
but
in
anna
pavlovnas
presence
no
one
dared
to
think
of
this
or
even
appear
to
know
it
.
they
say
the
poor
countess
is
very
ill
.
the
doctor
says
it
is
angina
pectoris
.
angina
oh
thats
a
terrible
illness
they
say
that
the
rivals
are
reconciled
thanks
to
the
angina

.

.

.
and
the
word
angina
was
repeated
with
great
satisfaction
.
the
old
count
is
pathetic
they
say
.
he
cried
like
a
child
when
the
doctor
told
him
the
case
was
dangerous
.
oh
it
would
be
a
terrible
loss
she
is
an
en
chanting
woman
.
you
are
speaking
of
the
poor
countess
said
anna
pavlovna
coming
up
just
then
.
i
sent
to
ask
for
news
and
hear
that
she
is
a
lit
534
war
and
peace
tie
better
.
oh
she
is
certainly
the
most
charm
ing
woman
in
the
world
she
went
on
with
a
smile
at
her
own
enthusiasm
.
we
belong
to
different
camps
but
that
does
not
prevent
my
esteeming
her
as
she
deserves
.
she
is
very
un
fortunate
added
anna
pdvlovna
.
supposing
that
by
these
words
anna
pav
lovna
was
somewhat
lifting
the
veil
from
the
secret
of
the
countess
malady
an
unwary
young
man
ventured
to
express
surprise
that
well
known
doctors
had
not
been
called
in
and
that
the
countess
was
being
attended
by
a
charlatan
who
might
employ
dangerous
remedies
.
your
information
may
be
better
than
mine
anna
pavlovna
suddenly
and
venomously
re
torted
on
the
inexperienced
young
man
but
i
know
on
good
authority
that
this
doctor
is
a
very
learned
and
able
man
.
he
is
private
phy
sician
to
the
queen
of
spain
.
and
having
thus
demolished
the
young
man
anna
pavlovna
turned
to
another
group
where
bilibin
was
talking
about

austrians

up
his

was
evidently
pre

to

of

i
think
it

delightful
he
said
referring
to
a
diplomatic
note
that
had
been
sent
to

some
austrian

he

during
his
diplomatic
career
he
had
more
than
once
noticed
that
such

were

as

at

he

next
day
during
the
service
at
the
palace
church
in
honor
of
the
emperors
birthday
prince
volkdnski
was
called
out
of
the
church
and
received
a
dispatch
from
prince
kutuzov
.
book
twelve
535
it
was
kutuzovs
report
written
from
tatari
nova
on
the
day
of
the
battle
.
kunizov
wrote
that
the
russians
had
not
retreated
a
step
that
the
french
losses
were
much
heavier
than
ours
and
that
he
was
writing
in
haste
from
the
field
of
battle
before
collecting
full
information
.
it
followed
that
there
must
have
been
a
victory
.
and
at
once
without
leaving
the
church
thanks
were
rendered
to
the
creator
for
his
help
and
for
the
victory
.
anna
pavlovnas
presentiment
was
justified
and
all
that
morning
a
joyously
festive
mood
reigned
in
the
city
.
everyone
believed
the
vic
tory
to
have
been
complete
and
some
even
spoke
of
napoleons
having
been
captured
of
his
deposition
and
of
the
choice
of
a
new
ruler
for
france
.
it
is
very
difficult
for
events
to
be
reflected
in
their
real
strength
and
completeness
amid
the
conditions
of
court
life
and
far
from
the
scene
of
action
.
general
events
involuntarily
group
themselves
around
some
particular
incident
.
so
now
the
courtiers
pleasure
was
based
as
much
on
the
fact
that
the
news
had
arrived
on
the
emperors
birthday
as
on
the
fact
of
the
victory
itself
.
it
was
like
a
successfully
arranged
surprise
.
mention
was
made
in
kutuzovs
re
port
of
the
russian
losses
among
which
fig
ured
the
names
of
tuchk6v
bagrati6n
and
kutaysov
.
in
the
petersburg
world
this
sad
side
of
the
affair
again
involuntarily
centered
round
a
single
incident
kutdysovs
death
.
ev

and
he
was
young
and
interesting
.
that
day
every
one
met
with
the
words
what
a
wonderful
coincidence
just
during
the
service
.
but
what
a
loss
kutdysov
is
how
sorry
i
am
whatdid
i
tell
you
about
kutiizov
prince
vasfli
now
said
with
a
prophets
pride
.
1
al
ways
said
he
was
the
only
man
capable
of
de
feating
napoleon
.
but
next
day
no
news
arrived
from
the
army
and
the
public
mood
grew
anxious
.
the
courtiers
suffered
because
of
the
suffering
the
suspense
occasioned
the
emperor
.
fancy
the
emperors
position
said
they
and
instead
of
extolling
kutiizov
as
they
had
done
the
day
before
they
condemned
him
as
the
cause
of
the
emperors
anxiety
.
that
day
prince
vasili
no
longer
boasted
of
his
protege
kutiizov
but
remained
silent
when
the
com
mander
in
chief
was
mentioned
.
moreover
toward
evening
as
if
everything
conspired
to
make
petersburg
society
anxious
and
uneasy
a
terrible
piece
of
news
was
added
.
countess
hdene
beziikhova
had
suddenly
died
of
that
terrible
malady
it
had
been
so
agreeable
to
mention
.
officially
at
large
gatherings
every
one
said
that
countess
beziikhova
had
died
of
a
terrible
attack
of
angina
pectoris
but
in
in
timate
circles
details
were
mentioned
of
how
the
private
physician
of
the
queen
of
spain
had
prescribed
small
doses
of
a
certain
drug
to
produce
a
certain
effect
but
h61ne
tortured
by
the
fact
that
the
old
count
suspected
her
and
that
her
husband
to
whom
she
had
written
that
wretched
profligate
pierre
had
not
re
plied
had
suddenly
taken
a
very
large
dose
of
the
drug
and
had
died
in
agony
before
assist
ance
could
be
rendered
her
.
it
was
said
that
prince
vasfli
and
the
old
count
had
turned
upon
the
italian
but
the
latter
had
produced
such
letters
from
the
unfortunate
deceased
that
they
had
immediately
let
the
matter
drop
.
talk
in
general
centered
round
three
melan
choly
facts
the
emperors
lack
of
news
the
loss
of
kutaysov
and
the
death
of
hlne
.
on
the
third
day
after
kutuzovs
report
a
country
gentleman
arrived
from
moscow
and
news
of
the
surrender
of
moscow
to
the
french
spread
through
the
whole
town
.
this
was
ter
rible
what
a
position
for
the
emperor
to
be
in
kutiizov
was
a
traitor
and
prince
vasfli
during
the
visits
of
condolence
paid
to
him
on
the
occasion
of
his
daughters
death
said
of
kutiizov
whom
he
had
formerly
praised
it
was
excusable
for
him
in
his
grief
to
forget
what
he
had
said
that
it
was
impossible
to
expect
anything
else
from
a
blind
and
depraved
old
man
.
i
only
wonder
that
the
fate
of
russia
could
have
been
entrusted
to
such
a
man
.
as
long
as
this
news
remained
unofficial
it
was
possible
to
doubt
it
but
the
next
day
the
following
communication
was
received
from
count
rostopchin
prince
kutiizo
s
adjutant
has
brought
me
a
let
ter
in
which
he
demands
police
officers
to
guide
the
army
to
the
ryazan
road
.
he
writes
that
he
is
regretfully
abandoning
moscow
.

the
fate
of

of

shudder
to
learn
of

which
her
greatness
is
cen
tered
and
in
which
lie
the
ashes
of
your
ancestors

shall
follow

i
have
had
everything
re
moved
and
it
only
remains
for
me
to
weep
over
the
fate
of
my
fatherland
.
on
receiving
this
dispatch
the
emperor
sent
prince
volk6nski
to
kutiizov
with
the
follow
ing

on
the
first
of

i
re
ceived
from
the
commander
in
chief
of
moscow
via
yaroslavl
the
sad
news
that
you
with
the
army
have
decided
to
abandon
moscow
.
you
can
yourself
imagine
the
effect
this
news
has
had
on
me
and
your
silence
increases
my
astonishment
.
i
am
sending
this
by

to
hear
from
you
the
situation
of
the
army
and
the
reasons
that
have
induced
you
to
take
this
melancholy
decision
.
chapter
iii
nine
days
after
the
abandonment
of
moscow
a
messenger
from
kutuzov
reached
petersburg
with
the
official
announcement
of
that
event
.
this
messenger
was
michaud
a
frenchman
who
did
not
know
russian
but
who
was
quoi
que
stranger
russe
de
cceur
et
ddme
as
he
said
of
himself
.
the
emperor
at
once
received
this
messenger
in
his
study
at
the
palace
on
stone
island
.
mi
chaud
who
had
never
seen
moscow
before
the
campaign
and
who
did
not
know
russian
yet
felt
deeply
moved
as
he
wrote
when
he
ap
peared
before
notre
trts
gracieux
souverain

with
the
news
of
the
burning
of
moscow
dont

though
the
source
of
m
.
michauds
chagrin
must
have
been
different
from
that
which
caused
russians
to
grieve
he
had
such
a
sad
face
when
shown
into
the
emperors
study
that
the
latter
at
once
asked
have
you
brought
me

news

very
sad

replied
michaud
lowering
his
eyes
with
a
sigh
.
the

of
moscow
.
have
they
surrendered
my
ancient
capital
without
a
battle
asked
the
emperor
quickly
his
face
suddenly
flushing
.
michaud
respectfully
delivered
the
message
kutuzov
had
entrusted
to
him
which
was
that
it
had
been
impossible
to
fight
before
moscow
and
that
as
the
only
remaining
choice
was
be
tween
losing
the
army
as
well
as
moscow
or
losing
moscow
alone
the
field
marshal
had
to
choose
the
latter
.
the
emperor
listened
in
silence
not
look
ing
at
michaud
.
has
the
enemy
entered
the
city
he
asked
.
yes
sire
and
moscow
is
now
in
ashes
.
i
left
it
all
in
flames
replied
michaud
in
a
de
cided
tone
but
glancing
at
the
emperor
he
was
frightened
by
what
he
had
done
.
1
though
a
foreigner
russian
in
heart
and
soul
.

our
most
gracious
sovereign
.

whose
flames
illumined
his
route
.
war
and
peace
the
emperor
began
to
breathe
heavily
and
rapidly
his
lower
lip
trembled
and
tears
in
stantly
appeared
in
his
fine
blue
eyes
.
but
this
lasted
only
a
moment
.
he
suddenly
frowned
as
if
blaming
himself
for
his
weakness
and
raising
his
head
addressed
michaud
in
a
firm
voice
i
see
colonel
from
all
that
is
happening
that
providence
requires
great
sacrifices
of
us
.

..
.
i
am
ready
to
submit
myself
in
all
things
to
his
will
but
tell
me
michaud
how
did
you
leave
the
army
when
it
saw
my
ancient
capital
abandoned
without
a
battle
did
you
not
no
tice
discouragement

.

.

.
seeing
that
his
most
gracious
ruler
was
calm
once
more
michaud
also
grew
calm
but
was
not
immediately
ready
to
reply
to
the
emper
ors
direct
and
relevant
question
which
re
quired
a
direct
answer
.
sire
will
you
allow
me
to
speak
frankly
as
befits
a
loyal
soldier
he
asked
to
gain
time
.
colonel
i
always
require
it
replied
the
emperor
.
conceal
nothing
from
me
i
wish
to
know
absolutely
how
things
are
.
sirel
said
michaud
with
a
subtle
scarcely
perceptible
smile
on
his
lips
having
now
pre
pared
a
wellphrased
reply
sire
i
left
the
whole
army
from
its
chiefs
to
the
lowest
sol
dier
without
exception
in
desperate
and
ago
nized
terror

.

.

.
how
is
that
the
emperor
interrupted
him
frowning
sternly
.
would
misfortune
make
my
russians
lose
heart

.

.

.
never
michaud
had
only
waited
for
this
to
bring
out
the
phrase
he
had
prepared
.
sire
he
said
with
respectful
playfulness
they
are
only
afraid
lest
your
majesty
in
the
goodness
of
your
heart
should
allow
yourself
to
be
persuaded
to
make
peace
.
they
are
burn
ing
for
the
combat
declared
this
representa
tive
of
the
russian
nation
and
to
prove
to
your
majesty
by
the
sacrifice
of
their
lives
how
devoted
they
are

ah
said
the
emperor
reassured
and
with
a
kindly
gleam
in
his
eyes
he
patted
michaud
on
the
shoulder
.
you
set
me
at
ease
colonel
.
he
bent
his
head
and
was
silent
for
some
time
.
well
then
go
back
to
the
army
he
said
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
ad
dressing
michaud
with
a
gracious
and
majestic
gesture
and
tell
our
brave
men
and
all
my
good
subjects
wherever
you
go
that
when
i
have
not
a
soldier
left
i
shall
put
myself
at
the
head
of
my
beloved
nobility
and
my
good
peasants
andsouse
the
last
resources
of
my
empire
.
it
still
offers
me
more
than
my
enemies
suppose
said
the
emperor
growing
more
and
more
ani
mated
but
should
it
ever
be
ordained
by
di
vine
providence
he
continued
raising
to
heav
en
his
fine
eyes
shining
with
emotion
that
my
dynasty
should
cease
to
reign
on
the
throne
of
my
ancestors
then
after
exhausting
all
the
means
at
my
command
i
shall
let
my
beard
grow
to
here
he
pointed
halfway
down
his
chest
and
go
and
eat
potatoes
with
the
mean
est
of
my
peasants
rather
than
sign
the
dis
grace
of
my
country
and
of
my
beloved
people
whose
sacrifices
i
know
how
to
appreciate
.
having
uttered
these
words
in
an
agitated
voice
the
emperor
suddenly
turned
away
as
if
to
hide
from
michaud
the
tears
that
rose
to
his
eyes
and
went
to
the
further
end
of
his
study
.
having
stood
there
a
few
moments
he
strode
back
to
michaud
and
pressed
his
arm
below
the
elbow
with
a
vigorous
movement
.
the
em
perors
mild
and
handsome
face
was
flushed
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
resolution
and
an
ger
.
colonel
michaud
do
not
forget
what
i
say
to
you
here
perhaps
we
may
recall
it
with

i
said
the

peror
touching
his
breast
.
we
can
no
longer

i
have
learned
to
know
him
and
he
will
not
deceive
me
any
more
.

.

.
and
the
emperor
paused
with
a
frown
.
when
he
heard
these
words
and
saw
the
ex
pression
of
firm
resolution
in
the
emperors
eyes
michaud
quoique
etranger
russe

that
solemn
moment
felt
himself
enraptured
by
all
that
he
had
heard
as
he
used
afterwards
to
say
and
gave
ex
pression
to
his
own
feelings
and
those
of
the
russian
people
whose

con

himself

chapter
iv
it
is
natural
for
us
who
were
not
living
in
those
days
to
imagine
that
when
half
russia
had
been
conquered
and
the
inhabitants
were
fleeing
to
distant
provinces
and
one
levy
after
another
was
being
raised
for
the
defense
of
the
fatherland
all
russians
from
the
greatest
to
the
least
were
solely
engaged
in
sacrificing
themselves
saving
their
fatherland
or
weep
ing
over
its
downfall
.
the
tales
and
descrip
tions
of
that
time
without
exception
speak
on
book
twelve
537
ly
of
the
selfsacrifice
patriotic
devotion
de
spair
grief
and
the
heroism
of
the
russians
.
but
it
was
not
really
so
.
it
appears
so
to
us
be
cause
we
see
only
the
general
historic
interest
of
that
time
and
do
not
see
all
the
personal
human
interests
that
people
had
.
yet
in
reality
those
personal
interests
of
the
moment
so
much
transcend
the
general
interests
that
they
al
ways
prevent
the
public
interest
from
being
felt
or
even
noticed
.
most
of
the
people
at
that
time
paid
no
attention
to
the
general
progress
of
events
but
were
guided
only
by
their
private
interests
and
they
were
the
very
people
whose
activities
at
that
period
were
most
useful
.
those
who
tried
to
understand
the
general
course
of
events
and
to
take
part
in
it
by
self
sacrifice
and
heroism
were
the
most
useless
members
of
society
they
saw
everything
up
side
down
and
all
they
did
for
the
common
good
turned
out
to
be
useless
and
foolishlike
pierres
and
mamonovs
regiments
which
loot
ed
russian
villages
and
the
lint
the
young
ladies
prepared
and
that
never
reached
the
wounded
and
so
on
.
even
those
fond
of
in
tellectual
talk
and
of
expressing
their
feelings
who
discussed
russias
position
at
the
time
in
voluntarily
introduced
into
their
conversation
either
a
shade
of
pretense
and
falsehood
or
use
less
condemnation
and
anger
directed
against
people
accused
of
actions
no
one
could
pos
sibly
be
guilty
of
.
in
historic
events
the
rule
forbidding
us
to
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
is
specially
applicable
.
only
un
conscious
action
bears
fruit
and
he
who
plays
a
part
in
an
historic
event
never
understands
its
significance
.
if
he
tries
to
realize
it
his
efforts
are
fruitless
.
the
more
closely
a
man
was
engaged
in
the
events
then
taking
place
in
russia
the
less
did
he
realize
their
significance
.
in
petersburg
and
in
the
provinces
at
a
distance
from
moscow
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
militia
uniforms
wept
for
russia
and
its
ancient
capital
and
talked
of
selfsacrifice
and
so
on
but
in
the
ar
my
which
retired
beyond
moscow
there
was
little
talk
or
thought
of
moscow
and
when
they
caught
sight
of
its
burned
ruins
no
one
swore
to
be
avenged
on
the
french
but
they
thought
about
their
next
pay
their
next
quar
ters
of
matreshka
the
vivandiere
and
like
matters
.
as
the
war
had
caught
him
in
the
service
nicholas
rost6v
took
a
close
and
prolonged
part
in
the
defense
of
his
country
but
did
so
casually
without
any
aim
at
selfsacritice
and
he
therefore
looked
at
what
was
going
on
in
538
war
and
peace
russia
without
despair
and
without
dismally
racking
his
brains
over
it
.
had
he
been
asked
what
he
thought
of
the
state
of
russia
he
would
have
said
that
it
was
not
his
business
to
think
about
it
that
kutuzov
and
others
were
there
for
that
purpose
but
that
he
had
heard
that
the
regiments
were
to
be
made
up
to
their
full
strength
that
fighting
would
probably
go
on
for
a
long
time
yet
and
that
things
being
so
it
was
quite
likely
he
might
be
in
command
of
a
regiment
in
a
couple
of
years
time
.
as
he
looked
at
the
matter
in
this
way
he
learned
that
he
was
being
sent
to
voronezh
to
buy
remounts
for
his
division
not
only
with
out
regret
at
being
prevented
from
taking
part
in
the
coming
battle
but
with
the
greatest
pleasure
which
he
did
not
conceal
and
which
his
comrades
fully
understood
.
a
few
days
before
the
battle
of
borodin6
nicholas
received
the
necessary
money
and
war
rants
and
having
sent
some
hussars
on
in
ad
vance
he
set
out
with
post
horses
for
vor6nezh
.
only
a
man
who
has
experienced
it
that
is
has
passed
some
months
continuously
in
an
at
mosphere
of
campaigning
and
war
can
under
stand
the
delight
nicholas
felt
when
he
es
caped
from
the
region
covered
by
the
armys
foraging
operations
provision
trains
and
hos
pitals
.
when
free
from
soldiers
wagons
and
the
filthy
traces
of
a
camp
he
saw
villages
with
peasants
and
peasant
women
gentlemens
country
houses
fields
where
cattle
were
graz
ing
posthouses
with
stationmasters
asleep
in
them
he
rejoiced
as
though
seeing
all
this
for
the
first
time
.
what
for
a
long
while
specially
surprised
and
delighted
him
were
the
women
young
and
healthy
without
a
dozen
officers
making
up
to
each
of
them
women
too
who
were
pleased
and
flattered
that
a
passing
offi
cer
should
joke
with
them
.
in
the
highest
spirits
nicholas
arrived
at
night
at
a
hotel
in
vor6nezh
ordered
things
he
had
long
been
deprived
of
in
camp
and
next
day
very
cleanshaven
and
in
a
fulldress
uniform
he
had
not
worn
for
a
long
time
went
to
present
himself
to
the
authorities
.
the
commander
of
the
militia
was
a
civilian
general
an
old
man
who
was
evidently
pleased
with
his
military
designation
and
rank
.
he
re
ceived
nicholas
brusquely
imagining
this
to
be
characteristically
military
and
questioned
him
with
an
important
air
as
if
considering
the
general
progress
of
affairs
and
approving
and
disapproving
with
full
right
to
do
so
.
nicholas
was
in
such
good
spirits
that
this
merely
amused
him
.
from
the
commander
of
the
militia
he
drove
to
the
governor
.
the
governor
was
a
brisk
little
man
very
simple
and
affable
.
he
indi
cated
the
stud
farms
at
which
nicholas
might
procure
horses
recommended
to
him
a
horse
dealer
in
the
town
and
a
landowner
fourteen
miles
out
of
town
who
had
the
best
horses
and
promised
to
assist
him
in
every
way
.
you
are
count
ilyi
rost6vs
son
my
wife
was
a
great
friend
of
your
mothers
.
we
are
at
home
on
thursdays
today
is
thursday
so
please
come
and
see
us
quite
informally
said
the
governor
taking
leave
of
him
.
immediately
on
leaving
the
governors
nich
olas
hired
post
horses
and
taking
his
squad
ron
quartermaster
with
him
drove
at
a
gallop
to
the
landowner
fourteen
miles
away
who
had
the
stud
.
everything
seemed
to
him
pleas
ant
and
easy
during
that
first
part
of
his
stay
in
vor6nezh
and
as
usually
happens
when
a
man
is
in
a
pleasant
state
of
mind
everything
went
well
and
easily
.
the
landowner
to
whom
nicholas
went
was
a
bachelor
an
old
cavalryman
a
horse
fancier
a
sportsman
the
possessor
of
some
centuryold
brandy
and
some
old
hungarian
wine
who
had
a
snuggery
where
he
smoked
and
who
owned
some
splendid
horses
.
in
very
few
words
nicholas
bought
seven
teen
picked
stallions
for
six
thousand
rubles
to
serve
as
he
said
as
samples
of
his
remounts
.
after
dining
and
taking
rather
too
much
of
the
hungarian
wine
nicholas
having
ex
changed
kisses
with
the
landowner
with
whom
he
was
already
on
the
friendliest
terms
gal
loped
back
over
abominable
roads
in
the
brightest
frame
of
mind
continually
urging
on
the
driver
so
as
to
be
in
time
for
the
gov
ernors
party
.
when
he
had
changed
poured
water
over
his
head
and
scented
himself
nicholas
arrived
at
the
governors
rather
late
but
with
the
phrase
better
late
than
never
on
his
lips
.
it
was
not
a
ball
nor
had
dancing
been
an
nounced
but
everyone
knew
that
catherine
petr6vna
would
play
valses
and
the
tcossaise
on
the
clavichord
and
that
there
would
be
dancing
and
so
everyone
had
corneas
to
a
ball
.
provincial
life
in
1812
went
on
very
much
as
usual
but
with
this
difference
that
it
was
livelier
in
the
towns
in
consequence
of
the
ar
rival
of
many
wealthy
families
from
moscow
and
as
in
everything
that
went
on
in
russia
at
that
time
a
special
recklessness
was
noticeable
an
in
for
a
penny
in
for
a
poundwho
cares
spirit
and
the
inevitable
small
talk
instead
of
book
twelve
5s9
turning
on
the
weather
and
mutual
acquaint
ances
now
turned
on
moscow
the
army
and
napoleon
.
the
society
gathered
together
at
the
gover
nors
was
the
best
in
vor6nezh
.
there
were
a
great
many
ladies
and
some
of
nicholas
moscow
acquaintances
but
there
were
no
men
who
could
at
all
vie
with
the
cav
alier
of
st
.
george
the
hussar
remount
officer
the
goodnatured
and
wellbred
count
rost6v
.
among
the
men
was
an
italian
prisoner
an
officer
of
the
french
army
and
nicholas
felt
that
the
presence
of
that
prisoner
enhanced
his
own
importance
as
a
russian
hero
.
the
italian
was
as
it
were
a
war
trophy
.
nicholas
felt
this
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
regarded
the
ital
ian
in
the
same
light
and
he
treated
him
cor
dially
though
with
dignity
and
restraint
.
as
soon
as
nicholas
entered
in
his
hussar
uniform
diffusing
around
him
a
fragrance
of
perfume
and
wine
and
had
uttered
the
words
better
late
than
never
and
heard
them
re
peated
several
times
by
others
people
clustered
around
him
all
eyes
turned
on
him
and
he
felt
at
once
that
he
had
entered
into
his
prop
er
position
in
the
province
that
of
a
universal
favorite
a
very
pleasant
position
and
intox
icatingly
so
after
his
long
privations
.
at
post
ing
stations
at
inns
and
in
the
landowners
snuggery
maidservants
had
been
flattered
by
his
notice
and
here
too
at
the
governors
party
there
were
as
it
seemed
to
nicholas
an
inex
haustible
number
of
pretty
young
women
mar
ried
and
unmarried
impatiently
awaiting
his
notice
.
the
women
and
girls
flirted
with
him
and
from
the
first
day
the
old
people
concerned
themselves
to
get
this
fine
young
daredevil
of
an
hussar
married
and
settled
down
.
among
these
was
the
governors
wife
herself
who
welcomed
rost6v
as
a
near
relative
and
called
him
nich
olas
.
catherine
petrdvna
did
actually
play
valses
and
the
tcossaise
and
dancing
began
in
which
nicholas
still
further
captivated
the
provincial
society
by
his
agility
.
his
particularly
free
man
ner
of
dancing
even
surprised
them
all
.
nicho
las
was
himself
rather
surprised
at
the
way
he
danced
that
evening
.
he
had
never
danced
like
that
in
moscow
and
would
even
have
consid
ered
such
a
very
free
and
easy
manner
improp
er
and
in
bad
form
but
here
he
felt
it
incum
bent
on
him
to
astonish
them
all
by
something
unusual
something
they
would
have
to
accept
as
the
regular
thing
in
the
capital
though
new
to
them
in
the
provinces
.
all
the
evening
nicholas
paid
attention
to
a
blueeyed
plump
and
pleasing
little
blonde
the
wife
of
one
of
the
provincial
officials
.
with
the
naive
conviction
of
young
men
in
a
merry
mood
that
other
mens
wives
were
created
for
them
rost6v
did
not
leave
the
ladys
side
and
treated
her
husband
in
a
friendly
and
conspira
torial
style
as
if
without
speaking
of
it
they
knew
how
capitally
nicholas
and
the
lady
would
get
on
together
.
the
husband
however
did
not
seem
to
share
that
conviction
and
tried
to
behave
morosely
with
rost6v
.
but
the
lat
ters
goodnatured
naivet
was
so
boundless
that
sometimes
even
he
involuntarily
yielded
to
nicholas
good
humor
.
toward
the
end
of
the
evening
however
as
the
wifes
face
grew
more
flushed
and
animated
the
husbands
be
came
more
and
more
melancholy
and
solemn
as
though
there
were
but
a
given
amount
of
animation
between
them
and
as
the
wifes
share
increased
the
husbands
diminished
.
chapter
v
nicholas
sat
leaning
slightly
forward
in
an
armchair
bending
closely
over
the
blonde
lady
and
paying
her
mythological
compliments
with
a
smile
that
never
left
his
face
.
jauntily
shift
ing
the
position
of
his
legs
in
their
tight
rid
ing
breeches
diffusing
an
odor
of
perfume
and
admiring
his
partner
himself
and
the
fine
outlines
of
his
legs
in
their
wellfitting
hessian
boots
nicholas
told
the
blonde
lady
that
he
wished
to
run
away
with
a
certain
lady
here
in
vor6nezh
.
which
lady
a
charming
lady
a
divine
one
.
her
eyes
nicholas
looked
at
his
partner
are
blue
her
mouth
coral
and
ivory
her
figure
he
glanced
at
her
shoulders
like
dianas
.

.

.

.
the
husband
came
up
and
sullenly
asked
his
wife
what
she
was
talking
about
.
ah
nikita
ivzhiych
cried
nicholas
rising
politely
and
as
if
wishing
nikita
ivnych
to
share
his
joke
he
began
to
tell
him
of
his
in
tention
to
elope
with
a
blonde
lady
.
the
husband
smiled
gloomily
the
wife
gaily
.
the
governors
goodnatured
wife
came
up
with
a
look
of
disapproval
.
anna

nicho

said
she
pronouncing
the

so
that
nicholas
at
once
understood
that
anna

was
a
very
important

.

please

very
well
very
well

.

.

.
oh
what
a
fellow
you
are
the
governors
wife
led
him
up
to
a
tall
and
very
stout
old
lady
with
a
blue
headdress
who
had
just
finished
her
game
of
cards
with
the
most
important
personages
of
the
town
.
this
was
malvintseva
princess
marys
aunt
on
her
mothers
side
a
rich
childless
widow
who
al
ways
lived
in
voronezh
.
when
rost6v
ap
proached
her
she
was
standing
settling
up
for
the
game
.
she
looked
at
him
and
screwing
up
her
eyes
sternly
continued
to
upbraid
the
gen
eral
who
had
won
from
her
.
very
pleased
mon
cher
she
then
said
holding
out
her
hand
to
nicholas
.
pray
come
and
see
me
.
after
a
few
words
about
princess
mary
and
her
late
father
whom
malvintseva
had
evident
ly
not
liked
and
having
asked
what
nicholas
knew
of
prince
andrew
who
also
was
evident
ly
no
favorite
of
hers
the
important
old
lady
dismissed
nicholas
after
repeating
her
invita
tion
to
come
to
see
her
.
nicholas
promised
to
come
and
blushed
again
as
he
bowed
.
at
the
mention
of
princess
mary
he
experienced
a
feeling
of
shyness
and
even
of
fear
which
he
himself
did
not
under
stand
.
when
he
had
parted
from
malvintseva
nich
olas
wished
to
return
to
the
dancing
but
the
governors
little
wife
placed
her
plump
hand
on
his
sleeve
and
saying
that
she
wanted
to
have
a
talk
with
him
led
him
to
her
sitting
room
from
which
those
who
were
there
imme
diately
withdrew
so
as
not
to
be
in
her
way
.
do
you
know
dear
boy
began
the
gov
ernors
wife
with
a
serious
expression
on
her
kind
little
face
that
really
would
be
the
match
for
you
would
you
like
me
to
arrange
it
whom
do
you
mean
aunt
asked
nicho
las
.
i
will
make
a
match
for
you
with
the
prin
cess
.
catherine
petr6vna
speaks
of
lily
but
i
say
no
the
princess
do
you
want
me
to
do
it
i
am
sure
your
mother
will
be
grateful
to
me
.
what
a
charming
girl
she
is
really
and
she
is
not
at
all
so
plain
either
.
not
at
all
replied
nicholas
as
if
offended
at
the
idea
.
as
befits
a
soldier
aunt
i
dont
force
myself
on
anyone
or
refuse
anything
he
and
peace
said
before
he
had
time
to
consider
what
he
was
saying
.
well
then
remember
this
is
not
a
joke
of
course
not
yes
yes
the
governors
wife
said
as
if
talk
ing
to
herself
.
but
my
dear
boy
among
oth
er
things
you
are
too
attentive
to
the
other
the
blonde
.
one
is
sorry
for
the
husband
really
.

.

.

.
oh
no
we
are
good
friends
with
him
said
nicholas
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
it
did
not
enter
his
head
that
a
pastime
so
pleasant
to
himself
might
not
be
pleasant
to
someone
else
.
but
what
nonsense
1
have
been
saying
to
the
governors
wife
thought
nicholas
sud
denly
at
supper
.
she
will
really
begin
to
ar
range
a
match

.

.

.
and
sonya

.

.

.

and
on
taking
leave
of
the
governors
wife
when
she
again
smilingly
said
to
him
well
then
re
member
he
drew
her
aside
.
but
see
here
to
tell
you
the
truth
aunt

.

.

.
what
is
it
my
dear
come
lets
sit
down
here
said
she
.
nicholas
suddenly
felt
a
desire
and
need
to
tell
his
most
intimate
thoughts
which
he
would
not
have
told
to
his
mother
his
sister
or
his
friend
to
this
woman
who
was
almost
a
stranger
.
when
he
afterwards
recalled
that
im
pulse
to
unsolicited
and
inexplicable
frankness
which
had
very
important
results
for
him
it
seemed
to
him
as
it
seems
to
everyone
in
such
cases
that
it
was
merely
some
silly
whim
that
seized
him
yet
that
burst
of
frankness
to
gether
with
other
trifling
events
had
immense
consequences
for
him
and
for
all
his
family
.
you
see
aunt
mamma
has
long
wanted
me
to
marry
an
heiress
but
the
very
idea
of
marrying
for
money
is
repugnant
to
me
.
oh
yes
i
understand
said
the
governors
wife
.
but
princess
bolk6nskaya
thats
another
matter
.
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
.
in
the
first
place
i
like
her
very
much
i
feel
drawn
to
her
and
then
after
i
met
her
under
such
circum
stancesso
strangely
the
idea
of
ten
occurred
to
me
this
is
fate
.
especially
if
you
remember
that
mamma
had
long
been
thinking
of
it
but
i
had
never
happened
to
meet
her
before
some
how
it
had
always
happened
that
we
did
not
meet
.
and
as
long
as
my
sister
natasha
was
en
gaged
to
her
brother
it
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
for
me
to
think
of
marrying
her
.
and
it
must
needs
happen
that
i
should
meet
her
just
when
natdshas
engagement
had
been
broken
off

..
.
and
then
everything



.
so
you
book
twelve
see

..
.
i
never
told
this
to
anyone
and
never
will
only
to
you
.
the
governors
wife
pressed
his
elbow
grate
fully
.
you
know
s6nya
my
cousin
i
love
her
and
promised
to
marry
her
and
will
do
so
.

..
.
so
you
see
there
can
be
no
question
about
said
nicholas
incoherently
and
blushing
.
my
dear
boy
what
a
way
to
look
at
it
you
know
s6nya
has
nothing
and
you
yourself
say
your
papas
affairs
are
in
a
very
bad
way
.
and
what
about
your
mother
it
would
kill
her
thats
one
thing
.
and
what
sort
of
life
would
it
be
for
s6nya
if
shes
a
girl
with
a
heart
your
mother
in
despair
and
you
all
ruined
.

.

.

.
no
my
dear
you
and
s6nya
ought
to
under
stand
that
.
nicholas
remained
silent
.
it
comforted
him
to
hear
these
arguments
.
all
the
same
aunt
it
is
impossible
he
re
joined
with
a
sigh
after
a
short
pause
.
be
sides
would
the
princess
have
me
and
besides
she
is
now
in
mourning
.
how
can
one
think
of
it
but
you
dont
suppose
im
going
to
get
you
married
at
once
there
is
always
a
right
way
of
doing
things
replied
the
governors
wife
.
what
a
matchmaker
you
are
aunt

.

nicholas
kissing
her
plump
little
hand

on
reaching

after

a
letter
from

giving

to
her
aunt
malvfntseva
at
vor6nezh
.
that
feel
ing
akin
to
temptation
which
had
tormented
her
during
her
fathers
illness
since
his
death
and
especially
since
her
meeting
with
rost6v
was
smothered
by
arrangements
for
the
jour
ney
anxiety
about
her
brother
settling
in
a
new
house
meeting
new
people
and
attend
ing
to
her
nephews
education
.
she
was
sad
.
now
after
a
month
passed
in
quiet
sur
roundings
she
felt
more
and
more
deeply
the
loss
of
her
father
which
was
associated
in
her
mind
with
the
ruin
of
russia
.
she
was
agitat
ed
and
incessantly
tortured
by
the
thought
of
the
dangers
to
which
her
brother
the
only
in
timate
person
now
remaining
to
her
was
ex
posed
.
she
was
worried
too
about
her
nephews
education
for
which
she
had
always
felt
her
self
incompetent
but
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
she
felt
at
peace
a
peace
arising
from
con
sciousness
of
having
stifled
those
personal
dreams
and
hopes
that
had
been
on
the
point
of
awakening
within
her
and
were
related
to
her
meeting
with
rost6v
.
the
day
after
her
party
the
governors
wife
came
to
see
malvintseva
and
after
discussing
her
plan
with
the
aunt
remarked
that
though
under
present
circumstances
a
formal
betroth
al
was
of
course
not
to
be
thought
of
all
the
same
the
young
people
might
be
brought
to
gether
and
could
get
to
know
one
another
.
malvintseva
expressed
approval
and
the
gov
ernors
wife
began
to
speakof
rost6vin
marys
presence
praising
him
and
telling
how
he
had
blushed
when
princess
marys
name
was
men
tioned
.
but
princess
mary
experienced
a
pain
ful
rather
than
a
joyful
feeling
her
mental
tranquillity
was
destroyed
and
desires
doubts
selfreproach
and
hopes
reawoke
.
during
the
two
days
that
elapsed
before
ros
t6v
called
princess
mary
continually
thought
of
how
she
ought
to
behave
to
him
.
first
she
decided
not
to
come
to
the
drawing
room
when
he
called
to
see
her
aunt
that
it
would
not
be
proper
for
her
in
her
deep
mourning
to
re
ceive
visitors
then
she
thought
this
would
be
rude
after
what
he
had
done
for
her
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
aunt
and
the
gover
nors
wife
had
intentions
concerning
herself
and
rost6v
their
looks
and
words
at
times
seemed
to
confirm
this
supposition
then
she
told
herself
tnat
only
she
with
her
sinful
na
ture
could
think
this
of
them
they
could
not
forget
that
situated
as
she
was
while
still
wear
ing
deep
mourning
such
matchmaking
would
be
an
insult
to
her
and
to
her
fathers
memory
.
assuming
that
she
did
go
down
to
see
him
princess
mary
imagined
the
words
he
would
say
to
her
and
what
she
would
say
to
him
and
these
words
sometimes
seemed
undeservedly
cold
and
then
to
mean
too
much
.
more
than
anything
she
feared
lest
the
confusion
she
felt
might
overwhelm
her
and
betray
her
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
.
but
when
on
sunday
after
church
the
foot
man
announced
in
the
drawing
room
that
count
rostov
had
called
the
princess
showed
no
confusion
only
a
slight
blush
suffused
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
lit
up
with
a
new
and
ra
diant
light
.
you
have
met
him
aunt
said
she
in
a
calm
voice
unable
herself
to
understand
that
she
could
be
outwardly
so
calm
and
natural
.
when
rost6v
entered
the
room
the
princess
dropped
her
eyes
for
an
instant
as
if
to
give
the
visitor
time
to
greet
her
aunt
and
then
just
as
nicholas
turned
to
her
she
raised
her
head
and
met
his
iqpk
with
shining
eyes
.
with
a
54
war
and
peace
movement
full
of
dignity
and
grace
she
half
rose
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
held
out
her
slen
der
delicate
hand
to
him
and
began
to
speak
in
a
voice
in
which
for
the
first
time
new
deep
womanly
notes
vibrated
.
mademoiselle
bouri
enne
who
was
in
the
drawing
room
looked
at
princess
mary
in
bewildered
surprise
.
herself
a
consummate
coquette
she
could
not
have
maneuvered
better
on
meeting
a
man
she
wished
to
attract
.
either
black
is
particularly
becoming
to
her
or
she
really
has
greatly
improved
without
my
having
noticed
it
.
and
above
all
what
tact
and
grace
thought
mademoiselle
bourienne
.
had
princess
mary
been
capableof
reflection
at
that
moment
she
would
have
been
more
surprised
than
mademoiselle
bourienne
at
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
herself
.
from
the
moment
she
recognized
that
dear
loved
face
a
new
life
force
took
possession
of
her
and
compelled
her
to
speak
and
act
apart
from
her
own
will
.
from
the
time
rostov
entered
her
face
became
suddenly
transformed
.
it
was
as
if
a
light
had
been
kindled
in
a
carved
and
painted
lantern
and
the
intricate
skillful
ar
tistic
work
on
its
sides
that
previously
seemed
dark
coarse
and
meaningless
was
suddenly
shown
up
in
unexpected
and
striking
beauty
.
for
the
first
time
all
that
pure
spiritual
in
ward
travail
through
which
she
had
lived
ap
peared
on
the
surface
.
all
her
inward
labor
her
dissatisfaction
with
herself
her
sufferings
her
strivings
after
goodness
her
meekness
love
and
selfsacrifice
all
this
now
shone
in
those
radiant
eyes
in
her
delicate
smile
and
in
ev
ery
trait
of
her
gentle
face
.
rost6v
saw
all
this
as
clearly
as
if
he
had
known
her
whole
life
.
he
felt
that
the
being
before
him
was
quite
different
from
and
bet
ter
than
anyone
he
had
met
before
and
above
all
better
than
himself
.
their
conversation
was
very
simple
and
un
important
.
they
spoke
of
the
war
and
like
everyone
else
unconsciously
exaggerated
their
sorrow
about
it
they
spoke
of
their
last
meet
ingnicholas
trying
to
change
the
subject
they
talked
of
the
governors
kind
wife
of
nich
olas
relations
and
of
princess
marys
.
she
did
not
talk
about
her
brother
divert
ing
the
conversation
as
soon
as
her
aunt
men
tioned
andrew
.
evidently
she
could
speak
of
russias
misfortunes
with
a
certain
artificiality
but
her
brother
was
too
near
her
heart
and
she
neither
could
nor
would
speak
lightly
of
him
.
nicholas
noticed
this
as
he
noticed
every
shade
of
princess
marys
character
with
an
ob
servation
unusual
to
him
and
everything
con
firmed
his
conviction
that
she
was
a
quite
un
usual
and
extraordinary
being
.
nicholas
blushed
and
was
confused
when
people
spoke
to
him
about
the
princess
as
she
did
when
he
was
mentioned
and
even
when
he
thought
of
her
but
in
her
presence
he
felt
quite
at
ease
and
said
not
at
all
what
he
had
prepared
but
what
quite
appropriately
occurred
to
him
at
the
moment
.
when
a
pause
occurred
during
his
short
vist
nicholas
as
is
usual
when
there
are
chil
dren
turned
to
prince
andrews
little
son
ca
ressing
him
and
asking
whether
he
would
like
to
be
an
hussar
.
he
took
the
boy
on
his
knee
played
with
him
and
looked
round
at
princess
mary
.
with
a
softened
happy
and
timid
look
she
watched
the
boy
she
loved
in
the
arms
of
the
man
she
loved
.
nicholas
also
noticed
that
look
and
as
if
understanding
it
flushed
with
pleasure
and
began
to
kiss
the
boy
with
good
natured
playfulness
.
as
she
was
in
mourning
princess
mary
did
not
go
out
into
society
and
nicholas
did
not
think
it
the
proper
thing
to
visit
her
again
but
all
the
same
the
governors
wife
went
on
with
her
matchmaking
passing
on
to
nicholas
the
flattering
things
princess
mary
said
of
him
and
vice
versa
and
insisting
on
his
declaring
him
self
to
princess
mary
.
for
this
purpose
she
ar
ranged
a
meeting
between
the
young
people
at
the
bishops
house
before
mass
.
though
rostov
told
the
governors
wife
that
he
would
not
make
any
declaration
to
princess
mary
he
promised
to
go
.
as
at
tilsit
rostov
had
not
allowed
himself
to
doubt
that
what
everybody
considered
right
was
right
so
now
after
a
short
but
sincere
strug
gle
between
his
effort
to
arrange
his
life
by
his
own
sense
of
justice
and
in
obedient
submis
sion
to
circumstances
he
chose
the
latter
and
yielded
to
the
power
he
felt
irresistibly
carry
ing
him
he
knew
not
where
.
he
knew
that
aft
er
his
promise
to
s6nya
it
would
be
what
he
deemed
base
to
declare
his
feelings
to
princess
mary
.
and
he
knew
that
he
would
never
act
basely
.
but
he
also
knew
or
rather
felt
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
that
by
resigning
himself
now
to
the
force
of
circumstances
and
to
those
who
were
guiding
him
he
was
not
only
doing
nothing
wrong
but
was
doing
something
very
very
important
more
important
than
anything
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
.
after
meeting
princess
mary
though
the
course
of
his
life
went
on
externally
as
before
all
his
former
amusements
lost
their
charm
for
book
twelve
lim
and
he
often
thought
about
her
.
but
he
lever
thought
about
her
as
he
had
thought
of
ill
the
young
ladies
without
exception
whom
he
had
met
in
society
nor
as
he
had
for
a
long

.ime
and
at
one
time
rapturously
thought
ibout
s6nya
.
he
had
pictured
each
of
those
roung
ladies
as
almost
all
honesthearted
young
men
do
that
is
as
a
possible
wife
adapting
her
in
his
imagination
to
all
the
conditions
of
married
life
a
white
dressing
gown
his
wife
it
the
tea
table
his
wifes
carriage
little
ones
mamma
and
papa
their
relations
to
her
and
o
on
and
these
pictures
of
the
future
had
giv
zn
him
pleasure
.
but
with
princess
mary
to
whom
they
were
trying
to
get
him
engaged
he
could
never
picture
anything
of
future
mar
ried
life
.
if
he
tried
his
pictures
seemed
in
congruous
and
false
.
it
made
him
afraid
.
543
chapter
vii
the
dreadful
news
of
the
battle
of
borodino
of
our
losses
in
killed
and
wounded
and
the
still
more
terrible
news
of
the
loss
of
moscow
reached
voronezh
in
the
middle
of
september
.
princess
mary
having
learned
of
her
brothers
wound
only
from
the
gazette
and
having
no
definite
news
of
him
prepared
so
nicholas
beard
he
had
not
seen
her
again
himself
to
set
off
in
search
of
prince
andrew
.
when
he
received
the
news
of
the
battle
of
borodin6
and
the
abandonment
of
moscow
rost6v
was
not
seized
with
despair
anger
the
desire
for
vengeance
or
any
feeling
of
that
kind
but
everything
in
vor6nezh
suddenly
seemed
to
him
dull
and
tiresome
and
he
ex
perienced
an
indefinite
feeling
of
shame
and
awkwardness
.
the
conversations
he
heard
seemed
to
him
insincere
he
did
not
know
how
to
judge
all
these
affairs
and
felt
that
only
in
the
regiment
would
everything
again
become
clear
to
him
.
he
made
haste
to
finish
buying
the
horses
and
often
became
unreasonably
an
gry
with
his
servant
and
squadron
quartermas
ter
.
a
few
days
before
his
departure
a
special
thanksgiving
at
which
nicholas
was
present
was
held
in
the
cathedral
for
the
russian
vic
tory
.
he
stood
a
little
behind
the
governor
and
held
himself
with
military
decorum
through
the
service
meditating
on
a
great
variety
of
subjects
.
when
the
service
was
over
the
gov
ernors
wife
beckoned
him
to
her
.
have
you
seen
the
princess
she
asked
indicating
with
a
movement
of
her
head
a
lady
standing
on
the
opposite
side
beyond
the
choir
.
nicholas
immediately
recognized
princess
mary
not
so
much
by
the
profile
he
saw
under
her
bonnet
as
by
the
feeling
of
solicitude
ti
midity
and
pity
that
immediately
overcame
him
.
princess
mary
evidently
engrossed
by
her
thoughts
was
crossing
herself
for
the
last
time
before
leaving
the
church
.
nicholas
looked
at
her
face
with
surprise
.
it
was
the
same
face
he
had
seen
before
there
was
the
same
general
expression
of
refined
in
ner
spiritual
labor
but
now
it
was
quite
dif
ferently
lit
up
.
there
was
a
pathetic
expres
sion
of
sorrow
prayer
and
hope
in
it
.
as
had
occurred
before
when
she
was
present
nicho
las
went
up
to
her
without
waiting
to
be
prompted
by
the
governors
wife
and
not
ask
ing
himself
whether
or
not
it
was
right
and
proper
to
address
her
here
in
church
and
told
her
he
had
heard
of
her
trouble
and
sympa
thized
with
his
whole
soul
.
as
soon
as
she
heard
his
voice
a
vivid
glow
kindled
in
her
face
light
ing
up
both
her
sorrow
and
her
joy
.
there
is
one
thing
i
wanted
to
tell
you
princess
said
rostov
.
it
is
that
if
your
broth
er
prince
andrew
nikolaevich
were
not
living
it
would
have
been
at
once
announced
in
the
gazette
as
he
is
a
colonel
.
the
princess
looked
at
him
not
grasping
what
he
was
saying
but
cheered
by
the
expres
sion
of
regretful
sympathy
on
his
face
.
and
i
have
known
so
many
cases
of
a
splin
ter
wound
the
gazette
said
it
was
a
shell
either
proving
fatal
at
once
or
being
very
slight
continued
nicholas
.
we
must
hope
for
the
best
and
i
am
sure

..
.
princess
mary
interrupted
him
.
oh
that
would
be
so
dread

.

.

.
she
began
and
prevented
by
agitation
from
finishing
she
bent
her
head
with
a
movement
as
graceful
as
everything
she
did
in
his
presence
and
look
ing
up
at
him
gratefully
went
out
following
her
aunt
.
that
evening
nicholas
did
not
go
out
but
stayed
at
home
to
settle
some
accounts
with
the
horse
dealers
.
when
he
had
finished
that
business
it
was
already
too
late
to
go
anywhere
but
still
too
early
to
go
to
bed
and
for
a
long
time
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
reflect
ing
on
his
life
a
thing
he
rarely
did
.
princess
mary
had
made
an
agreeable
im
pression
on
him
when
he
had
met
her
in
smo
16nsk
province
.
his
having
encountered
her
in
such
exceptional
circumstances
and
his
mother
having
at
one
time
mentioned
her
to
him
as
a
good
match
had
drawn
his
particular
attention
to
her
.
when
he
met
her
again
in
544
vor6nezh
the
impression
she
made
on
him
was
not
merely
pleasing
but
powerful
.
nicholas
had
been
struck
by
the
peculiar
moral
beauty
he
observed
in
her
at
this
time
.
he
was
how
ever
preparing
to
go
away
and
it
had
not
en
tered
his
head
to
regret
that
he
was
thus
de
priving
himself
of
chances
of
meeting
her
.
but
that
days
encounter
in
church
had
he
felt
sunk
deeper
than
was
desirable
for
his
peace
of
mind
.
that
pale
sad
refined
face
that
radi
ant
look
those
gentle
graceful
gestures
and
especially
the
deep
and
tender
sorrow
expressed
in
all
her
features
agitated
him
and
evoked
his
sympathy
.
in
men
rost6v
could
not
bear
to
see
the
expression
of
a
higher
spiritual
life
that
was
why
he
did
not
like
prince
andrew
and
he
referred
to
it
contemptuously
as
philosophy
and
dreaminess
but
in
princess
mary
that
very
sorrow
which
revealed
the
depth
of
a
whole
spiritual
world
foreign
to
him
was
an
irresist
ible
attraction
.
she
must
be
a
wonderful
woman
.
a
real
angel
he
said
to
himself
.
why
am
i
not
free
why
was
i
in
such
a
hurry
with
s6nya
and
he
involuntarily
compared
the
two
the
lack
of
spirituality
in
the
one
and
the
abun
dance
of
it
in
the
other
a
spirituality
he
him
self
lacked
and
therefore
valued
most
highly
.
he
tried
to
picture
what
would
happen
were
he
free
.
how
he
would
propose
to
her
and
how
she
would
become
his
wife
.
but
no
he
could
not
imagine
that
.
he
felt
awed
and
no
clear
picture
presented
itself
to
his
mind
.
he
had
long
ago
pictured
to
himself
a
future
with
s6n
ya
and
that
was
all
clear
and
simple
just
be
cause
it
had
all
been
thought
out
and
he
knew
all
there
was
in
s6nya
but
it
was
impossible
to
picture
a
future
with
princess
mary
because
he
did
not
understand
her
but
simply
loved
her
.
reveries
about
s6nya
had
had
something
merry
and
playful
in
them
but
to
dream
of
princess
mary
was
always
difficult
and
a
little
frightening
.
how
she
prayed
he
thought
.
it
was
plain
that
her
whole
soul
was
in
her
prayer
.
yes
that
was
the
prayer
that
moves
mountains
and
i
am
sure
her
prayer
will
be
answered
.
why
dont
i

suddenly
thought
.

he
suddenly
began
to
pray
.
yes
prayer
can
move
mountains
but
one
must
have
faith
and
not
pray
as
natdsha
and
i
used
to
as
children
that
the
snow
might
turn
into
sugar
and
then
run
out
into
the
yard
to
see
whether
it
had
done
so
.
no
but
i
am
not
praying
for
trifles
now
he
thought
as
he
put
his
pipe
down
in
a
corner
and
folding
his
hands
placed
himself
before
the
icon
.
softened
by
memories
of
princess
mary
he
began
to
pray
as
he
had
not
done
for
a
long
time
.
tears
were
in
his
eyes
and
in
his
throat
when
the
door
opened
and
lavnishka
came
in
with
some
papers
.

lavrushka
in

sleepy
voice

nicholas
took
the
two
letters
one
of
which
was
from
his
mother
and
the
other
from
s6n
ya
.
he
recognized
them
by
the
handwriting
and
opened
s6nyas
first
.
he
had
read
only
a
few
lines
when
he
turned
pale
and
his
eyes
opened
wide
with
fear
and
joy
.
no
its
not
possible
he
cried
aloud
.
unable
to
sit
still
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
holding
the
letter
and
reading
it
.
he
glanced
through
it
then
read
it
again
and
then
again
and
standing
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
raised
his
shoulders
stretching
out
his
hands
with
his
mouth
wide
open
and
his
eyes
fixed
.
what
he
had
just
been
pray
ing
for
with
confidence
that
god
would
hear
him
had
come
to
pass
but
nicholas
was
as
much
astonished
as
if
it
were
something
ex
traordinary
and
unexpected
and
as
if
the
very
fact
that
it
had
happened
so
quickly
proved
that
it
had
not
come
from
god
to
whom
he
fyad
prayed
but
by
some
ordinary
coincidence
.
this
unexpected
and
as
it
seemed
to
nich

quite
voluntary
letter
from
s6nya
freed
him
from
the
knot
that
fettered
him
and
from
which
there
had
seemed
no

was
prompted
by
this
the
thought
of
getting
nich
olas
married
to
an
heiress
occupied
the
old
countess
mind
more
and
more
.
she
knew
that
6nya
was
the
chief
obstacle
to
this
happening
and
sonyas
life
in
the
countess
house
had
epown
harder
and
harder
especially
after
they
had
received
a
letter
from
nicholas
telling
of
his
meeting
with
princess
mary
in
bogucharo
vo
.
the
countess
let
no
occasion
slip
of
mak
ing
humiliating
or
cruel
allusions
to
sonya
.
but
a
few
days
before
they
left
moscow
moved
and
excited
by
all
that
was
going
on
she
called
s6nya
to
her
and
instead
of
re
proaching
and
making
demands
on
her
tear
fully
implored
her
to
sacrifice
herself
and
re
pay
all
that
the
family
had
done
for
her
by
breaking
off
her
engagement
with
nicholas
.
i
shall
not
be
at
peace
till
you
promise
me
this
.
s6nya
burst
into
hysterical
tears
and
replied
through
her
sobs
that
she
would
do
anything
and
was
prepared
for
anything
but
gave
no
actual
promise
and
could
not
bring
herself
to
decide
to
do
what
was
demanded
of
her
.
she
must
sacrifice
herself
for
the
family
that
had
reared
and
brought
her
up
.
to
sacrifice
her
self
for
others
was
sonyas
habit
.
her
position
in
the
house
was
such
that
only
by
sacrifice
could
she
show
her
worth
and
she
was
accus
tomed
to
this
and
loved
doing
it
.
but
in
all
her
former
acts
of
selfsacrifice
she
had
been
hap
pily
conscious
that
they
raised
her
in
her
own
esteem
and
in
that
of
others
and
so
made
her
more
worthy
of
nicholas
whom
she
loved
more
than
anything
in
the
world
.
but
now
they
wanted
her
to
sacrifice
the
very
thing
that
con
stituted
the
whole
reward
for
her
selfsacrifice
and
the
whole
meaning
of
her
life
.
and
for
the
first
time
she
felt
bitterness
against
those
who
had
been
her
benefactors
only
to
torture
her
the
more
painfully
she
felt
jealous
of
natasha
who
had
never
experienced
anything
of
this
sort
had
never
needed
to
sacrifice
herself
but
made
others
sacrifice
themselves
for
her
and
yet
was
beloved
by
everybody
.
and
for
the
first
time
s6nya
felt
that
out
of
her
pure
quiet
love
for
nicholas
a
passionate
feeling
was
begin
ning
to
grow
up
which
was
stronger
than
prin
ciple
virtue
or
religion
.
under
the
influence
of
this
feeling
s6nya
whose
life
of
dependence
had
taught
her
involuntarily
to
be
secretive
having
answered
the
countess
in
vague
general
terms
avoided
talking
with
her
and
resolved
to
wait
till
she
should
see
nicholas
not
in
or
der
to
set
him
free
but
on
the
contrary
at
that
meeting
to
bind
him
to
her
forever
.
the
bustle
and
terror
of
the
rostovs
last
days
in
moscow
stifled
the
gloomy
thoughts
that
oppressed
sonya
.
she
was
glad
to
find
es
cape
from
them
in
practical
activity
.
but
when
she
heard
of
prince
andrews
presence
in
their
house
despite
her
sincere
pity
for
him
and
for
natdsha
she
was
seized
by
a
joyful
and
super
stitious
feeling
that
god
did
not
intend
her
to
be
separated
from
nicholas
.
she
knew
that
natasha
loved
no
one
but
prince
andrew
and
had
never
ceased
to
love
him
.
she
knew
that
being
thrown
together
again
under
such
ter
rible
circumstances
they
would
again
fall
in
love
with
one
another
and
that
nicholas
would
then
not
be
able
to
marry
princess
mary
as
they
would
be
within
the
prohibited
degrees
of
affinity
.
despite
all
the
terror
of
what
had
happened
during
those
last
days
and
during
the
first
days
of
their
journey
this
feeling
that
providence
was
intervening
in
her
personal
affairs
cheered
sonya
.
at
the
tr6itsa
monastery
the
rost6vs
first
broke
their
journey
for
a
whole
day
.
three
large
rooms
were
assigned
to
them
in
the
monastery
hostelry
one
of
which
was
oc
cupied
by
prince
andrew

war
and
peace
was
much
better
that
day
and
natdsha
was
sit
ting
with
him
.
in
the
next
room
sat
the
count
and
countess
respectfully
conversing
with
the
prior
who
was
calling
on
them
as
old
acquaint
ances
and
benefactors
of
the
monastery
.
s6n
ya
was
there
too
tormented
by
curiosity
as
to
what
prince
andrew
and
natasha
were
talking
about
.
she
heard
the
sound
of
their
voices
through
the
door
.
that
door
opened
and
na
tdsha
came
out
looking
excited
.
not
noticing
the
monk
who
had
risen
to
greet
her
and
was
drawing
back
the
wide
sleeve
on
his
right
arm
she
went
up
to
s6nya
and
took
her
hand
.
natdsha
what
are
you
about
come
here
said
the
countess
.
natdsha
went
up
to
the
monk
for
his
bless
ing
and
he
advised
her
to
turn
for
aid
to
god
and
his
saint
.
as
soon
as
the
prior
withdrew
natdsha
took
her
friend
by
the
hand
and
went
with
her
into
the
unoccupied
room
.
s6nya
will
he
live
she
asked
.
s6nya
how
happy
i
am
and
how
unhappy

.

everything
is

and
natdsha
burst
into
tears
.
yes
i
knew
it
thank

murmured
s6nya
.
he
will
live
.
sonya
was
not
less
agitated
than
her
friend
by
the
latters
fear
and
grief
and
by
her
own
personal
feelings
which
she
shared
with
no
one
.
sobbing
she
kissed
and
comforted
natd
sha
.
if
only
he
lives
she
thought
.
having
wept
talked
and
wiped
away
their
tears
the
two
friends
went
together
to
prince
andrews
door
.
natdsha
opened
it
cautiously
and
glanced
into
the
room
s6nya
standing
beside
her
at
the
halfopen
door
.
prince
andrew
was
lying
raised
high
on
three
pillows
.
his
pale
face
was
calm
his
eyes
closed
and
they
could
see
his
regular
breath
ing
.
o
natdsha
s6nya
suddenly
almost
screamed
catching
her
companions
arm
and
stepping
back
from
the
door
.
what
what
is
it
asked
natdsha
.
its
that
that

.

.

.
said
s6nya
with
a
white
face
and
trembling
lips
.
natdsha
softly
closed
the
door
and
went
with
sonya
to
the
window
not
yet
understanding
what
the
latter
was
telling
her
.
you
remember
said
s6nya
with
a
solemn
and
frightened
expression
.
you
remember
when
i
looked
in
the
mirror
for
you

..
.
at
otrddnoe
at
christinas
do
you
remember
what
i
saw
yes
yes
cried
natdsha
opening
her
eyes
wide
and
vaguely
recalling
that
s6nya
had
told
her
something
about
prince
andrew
whom
she
had
seen
lying
down
.
you
remember
s6nya
went
on
.
i
saw
it
then
and
told
everybody
you
and
dunydsha
.
i
saw
him
lying
on
a
bed
said
she
making
a
gesture
with
her
hand
and
a
lifted
finger
at
each
detail
and
that
he
had
his
eyes
closed
and
was
covered
just
with
a
pink
quilt
and
that
his
hands
were
folded
she
concluded
convincing
herself
that
the
details
she
had
just
seen
were
exactly
what
she
had
seen
in
the
mirror
.
she
had
in
fact
seen
nothing
then
but
had
mentioned
the
first
thing
that
came
into
her
head
but
what
she
had
invented
then
seemed
to
her
now
as
real
as
any
other
recollection
.
she
not
only
remembered
what
she
had
then
saidthat
he
turned
to
look
at
her
and
smiled
and
was
covered
with
something
red
but
was
firmly
convinced
that
she
had
then
seen
and
said
that
he
was
covered
with
a
pink
quilt
and
that
his
eyes
were
closed
.
yes
yes
it
really
was
pink
cried
natdsha
who
now
thought
she
too
remembered
the
word
pink
being
used
and
saw
in
this
the
most
extraordinary
and
mysterious
part
of
the
prediction
.
but
what
does
it
mean
she
added
medita
tively
.
oh
i
dont
know
it
is
all
so
strange
re
plied
s6nya
clutching
at
her
head
.
a
few
minutes
later
prince
andrew
rang
and
natdsha
went
to
him
but
s6nya
feeling
unusually
excited
and
touched
remained
at
the
window
thinking
about
the
strangeness
of
what
had
occurred
.
they
had
an
opportunity
that
day
to
send
letters
to
the
army
and
the
countess
was
writ
ing
to
her
son
.
s6nyal
said
the
countess
raising
her
eyes
from
her
letter
as
her
niece
passed
s6nya
wont
you
write
to
nicholas
she
spoke
in
a
soft
tremulous
voice
and
in
the
weary
eyes
that
looked
over
her
spectacles
s6nya
read
all
that
the
countess
meant
to
convey
with
these
words
.
those
eyes
expressed
entreaty
shame
at
having
to
ask
fear
of
a
refusal
and
readi
ness
for
relentless
hatred
in
case
of
such
refusal
.
s6nya
went
up
to
the
countess
and
kneeling
down
kissed
her
hand
.
yes
mamma
i
will
write
said
she
.
s6nya
was
softened
excited
and
touched
by
all
that
had
occurred
that
day
especially
by
book
twelve
the
mysterious
fulfillment
she
had
just
seen
of
her
vision
.
now
that
she
knew
that
the
renewal
of
natdshas
relations
with
prince
andrew
would
prevent
nicholas
from
marrying
prin
cess
mary
she
was
joyfully
conscious
of
a
re
turn
of
that
selfsacrificing
spirit
in
which
she
was
accustomed
to
live
and
loved
to
live
.
so
with
a
joyful
consciousness
of
performing
a
magnanimous
deedinterrupted
several
times
by
the
tears
that
dimmed
her
velvety
black
eyes
she
wrote
that
touching
letter
the
arrival
of
which
had
so
amazed
nicholas
.

who
had

treated
him
with
hostility

yet
with
respect
in

he
was

in

uncertainty
as

his
captors
and
in
fact
the
guard
of
the
second
day
did
not
recognize
in
this
big
stout
man
in
a
peasant
coat
the
vigor
ous
person
who
had
fought
so
desperately
with
the
marauder
and
the
convoy
and
had
uttered
those
solemn
words
about
saving
a
child
they
saw
in
him
only
no
.
17
of
the
captured
rus
sians
arrested
and
detained
for
some
reason
by
order
of
the
higher
command
.
if
they
noticed
anything
remarkable
about
pierre
it
was
only
his
unabashed
meditative
concentra
tion
and
thoughtfulness
and
the
way
he
spoke
french
which
struck
them
as
surprisingly
good
.
in
spite
of
this
he
was
placed
that
day
with
the
other
arrested
suspects
as
the
sepa
rate
room
he
had
occupied
was
required
by
an
officer
.
all
the
russians
confined
with
pierre
were
men
of
the
lowest
class
and
recognizing
him
as
a
gentleman
they
all
avoided
him
more
es
pecially
as
he
spoke
french
.
pierre
felt
sad
at
hearing
them
making
fun
of
him
.
that
evening
he
learned
that
all
these
pris
oners
he
probably
among
them
were
to
be
tried
for
incendiarism
.
on
the
third
day
he
was
taken
with
the
others
to
a
house
where
a
french
general
with
a
white
mustache
sat
with
two
colonels
and
other
frenchmen
with
scarves
on
their
arms
.
with
the
precision
and
definite
ness
customary
in
addressing
prisoners
and
which
is
supposed
to
preclude
human
frailty
pierre
like
the
others
was
questioned
as
to
who
he
was
where
he
had
been
with
what
object
and
so
on
.
these
questions
like
questions
put
at
trials
generally
left
the
essence
of
the
matter
aside
shut
out
the
possibility
of
that
essences
being
revealed
and
were
designed
only
to
form
a
channel
through
which
the
judges
wished
the
answers
of
the
accused
to
flow
so
as
to
lead
to
the
desired
result
namely
a
conviction
.
as
soon
as
pierre
began
to
say
anything
that
did
not
fit
in
with
that
aim
the
channel
was
re
moved
and
the
water
could
flow
to
waste
.
pierre
felt
moreover
what
the
accused
always
feel
at
their
trial
perplexity
as
to
why
these
questions
were
put
to
him
.
he
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
only
out
of
condescension
or
a
kind
of
civility
that
this
device
of
placing
a
channel
was
em
ployed
.
he
knew
he
was
in
these
mens
power
that
only
by
force
had
they
brought
him
there
that
force
alone
gave
them
the
right
to
de
mand
answers
to
their
questions
and
that
the
sole
object
of
that
assembly
was
to
inculpate
him
.
and
so
as
they
had
the
power
and
wish
to
inculpate
him
this
expedient
of
an
inquiry
and
trial
seemed
unnecessary
.
it
was
evident
that
any
answer
would
lead
to
conviction
.
when
asked
what
he
was
doing
when
he
was
arrested
pierre
replied
in
a
rather
tragic
man
ner
that
he
was
restoring
to
its
parents
a
child
he
had
saved
from
the
flames
.
why
had
he
fought
the
marauder
pierre
answered
that
he
was
protecting
a
woman
and
that
to
pro
tect
a
woman
who
was
being
insulted
was
the
duty
of
every
man
that

.

.

.
they
interrupted
him
for
this
was
not
to
the
point
.
why
was
he
in
the
yard
of
a
burning
house
where
witnesses
had
seen
him
he
replied
that
he
had
gone
out
to
see
what
was
happening
in
moscow
.
again
they
interrupted
him
they
had
not
asked
where
he
was
going
but
why
he
was
found
near
the
fire
who
was
he
they
asked
repeating
their
first
question
which
he
had
de
clined
to
answer
.
again
he
replied
that
he
could
not
answer
it
.
put
that
down
thats
bad

.

.

.
very
bad
sternly
remarked
the
general
with
the
white
mustache
and
red
flushed
face
.
on
the
fourth
day
fires
broke
out
on
the
ziibovski
rampart
.
pierre
and
thirteen
others
were
moved
to
the
coach
house
of
a
merchants
house
near
the
crimean
bridge
.
on
his
way
through
the
streets
pierre
felt
stifled
by
the
smoke
which
seemed
to
hang
over
the
whole
city
.
fires
were
548
war
and
peace
visible
on
all
sides
.
he
did
not
then
realize
the
significance
of
the
burning
of
moscow
and
looked
at
the
fires
with
horror
.
he
passed
four
days
in
the
coach
house
near
the
crimean
bridge
and
during
that
time
learned
from
the
talk
of
the
french
soldiers
that
all
those
confined
there
were
awaiting
a
decision
which
might
come
any
day
from
the
marshal
.
what
marshal
this
was
pierre
could
not
learn
from
the
soldiers
.
evidently
for
them
the
marshal
represented
a
very
high
and
rath
er
mysterious
power
.
these
first
days
before
the
eighth
of
sep
tember
when
the
prisoners
were
had
up
for
a
second
examination
were
the
hardest
of
all
for
pierre
.
chapter
x
on
the
eighth
of
september
an
officer
avery
important
one
judging
by
the
respect
the
guards
showed
him
entered
the
coach
house
where
the
prisoners
were
.
this
officer
proba
bly
someone
on
the
staff
was
holding
a
paper
in
his
hand
and
called
over
all
the
russians
there
naming
pierre
as
the
man
who
does
not
give
his
name
.
glancing
indolently
and
indifferently
at
all
the
prisoners
he
ordered
the
officer
in
charge
to
have
them
decently
dressed
and
tidied
up
before
taking
them
to
the
marshal
.
an
hour
later
a
squad
of
soldiers
arrived
and
pierre
with
thirteen
others
was
led
to
the
virgins
field
.
it
was
a
fine
day
sunny
after
rain
and
the
air
was
unusually
pure
.
the
smoke
did
not
hang
low
as
on
the
day
when
pierre
had
been
taken
from
the
guardhouse
on
the
zubovski
rampart
but
rose
through
the
pure
air
in
columns
.
no
flames
were
seen
but
columns
of
smoke
rose
on
all
sides
and
all
moscow
as
far
as
pierre
could
see
was
one
vast
charred
ruin
.
on
all
sides
there
were
waste
spaces
with
only
stoves
and
chimney
stacks
still
standing
and
here
and
there
the
black
ened
walls
of
some
brick
houses
.
pierre
gazed
at
the
ruins
and
did
not
recognize
districts
he
had
known
well
.
here
and
there
he
could
see
churches
that
had
not
been
burned
.
the
krm
lin
which
was
not
destroyed
gleamed
white
in
the
distance
with
its
towers
and
the
belfry
of
ivan
the
great
.
the
domes
of
the
new
con
vent
of
the
virgin
glittered
brightly
and
its
bells
were
ringing
particularly
clearly
.
these
bells
reminded
pierre
that
it
was
sunday
and
the
feast
of
the
nativity
of
the
virgin
.
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
to
celebrate
this
holiday
everywhere
were
blackened
ruins
and
the
few
russians
to
be
seen
were
tattered
and

.
frightened
people
who
tried
to
hide
when
they
saw
the
french
.
it
was
plain
that
the
russian
nest
was
ruined
and
destroyed
but
in
place
of
the
russian
or
der
of
life
that
had
been
destroyed
pierre
un
consciously
felt
that
a
quite
different
firm
french
order
had
been
established
over
this
ruined
nest
.
he
felt
this
in
the
looks
of
the
sol
diers
who
marching
in
regular
ranks
briskly
and
gaily
were
escorting
him
and
the
other
criminals
he
felt
it
in
the
looks
of
an
impor
tant
french
official
in
a
carriage
and
pair
driven
by
a
soldier
whom
they
met
on
the
way
.
he
felt
it
in
the
merry
sounds
of
regimental
music
he
heard
from
the
left
side
of
the
field
and
felt
and
realized
it
especially
from
the
list
of
pris
oners
the
french
officer
had
read
out
when
he
came
that
morning
.
pierre
had
been
taken
by
one
set
of
soldiers
and
led
first
to
one
and
then
to
another
place
with
dozens
of
other
men
and
it
seemed
that
they
might
have
forgotten
him
or
confused
him
with
the
others
.
but
no
the
answers
he
had
given
when
questioned
had
come
back
to
him
in
his
designation
as
the
man
who
does
not
give
his
name
and
under
that
appellation
which
to
pierre
seemed
ter
rible
they
were
now
leading
him
somewhere
with
unhesitating
assurance
on
their
faces
that
he
and
all
the
other
prisoners
were
exactly
the
ones
they
wanted
and
that
they
were
being
taken
to
the
proper
place
.
pierre
felt
himself
to
be
an
insignificant
chip
fallen
among
the
wheels
of
a
machine
whose
action
he
did
not
understand
but
which
was
working
well
.
he
and
the
other
prisoners
were
taken
to
the
right
side
of
the
virgins
field
to
a
large
white
house
with
an
immense
garden
not
far
from
the
convent
.
this
was
prince
shcherba
tovs
house
where
pierre
had
often
been
in
other
days
and
which
as
he
learned
from
the
talk
of
the
soldiers
was
now
occupied
by
the
marshal
the
duke
of
eckmiihl
davout
.
they
were
taken
to
the
entrance
and
led
in
to
the
house
one
by
one
.
pierre
was
the
sixth
to
enter
.
he
was
conducted
through
a
glass
gallery
an
anteroom
and
a
hall
which
were
familiar
to
him
into
a
long
low
study
at
the
door
of
which
stood
an
adjutant
.
davout
spectacles
on
nose
sat
bent
over
a
table
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
.
pierre
went
close
up
to
him
but
davout
evidently
consulting
a
paper
that
lay
before
him
did
not
look
up
.
without
raising
his
eyes
he
said
in
a
low
voice

who
are
you
pierre
was
silent
because
he
was
incapable
book
twelve
of
uttering
a
word
.
to
him
davout
was
not
merely
a
french
general
but
a
man
notorious
for
his
cruelty
.
looking
at
his
cold
face
as
he
sat
like
a
stern
schoolmaster
who
was
prepared
to
wait
awhile
for
an
answer
pierre
felt
that
every
instant
of
delay
might
cost
him
his
life
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
he
did
not
venture
to
repeat
what
he
had
said
at
his
first
examination
yet
to
disclose
his
rank
and
posi
tion
was
dangerous
and
embarrassing
.
so
he
was
silent
.
but
before
he
had
decided
what
to
do
davout
raised
his
head
pushed
his
spec
tacles
back
on
his
forehead
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
looked
intently
at
him
.
i
know
that
man
he
said
in
a
cold
meas
ured
tone
evidently
calculated
to
frighten
pierre
.
the
chill
that
had
been
running
down
pierres
back
now
seized
his
head
as
in
a
vise
.
you
cannot
know
me
general
i
have
nev
er
seen
you

.

.

.
he
is
a
russian
spy
davout
interrupted
addressing
another
general
who
was
present
but
whom
pierre
had
not
noticed
.
davout
turned
away
.
with
an
unexpected
reverberation
in
his
voice
pierre
rapidly
be
gan
no
monseigneur
he
said
suddenly
re
membering
that
davout
was
a
duke
.
no
mon
seigneur
you
cannot
have
known
me
.
i
am
a
militia
officer
and
have
not
quitted
moscow
.
your
name
asked
davout
.
bezukhov
.
what
proof
have
i
that
you
are
not
lying
monseigneur
exclaimed
pierre
not
in
an
offended
but
in
a
pleading
voice
.
davout
looked
up
and
gazed
intently
at
him
.
for
some
seconds
they
looked
at
one
another
and
that
look
saved
pierre
.
apart
from
condi
tions
of
war
and
law
that
look
established
hu
man
relations
between
the
two
men
.
at
that
moment
an
immense
number
of
things
passed
dimly
through
both
their
minds
and
they
re
alized
that
they
were
both
children
of
human
ity
and
were
brothers
.
at
the
first
glance
when
davout
had
only
raised
his
head
from
the
papers
where
human
affairs
and
lives
were
indicated
by
numbers
pierre
was
merely
a
circumstance
and
davout
could
have
shot
him
without
burdening
his
conscience
with
an
evil
deed
but
now
he
saw
in
him
a
human
being
.
he
reflected
for
a
mo
ment
.
how
can
you
show
me
that
you
are
telling
the
truth
said
davout
coldly
.
pierre
remembered
ramballe
and
named
549
him
and
his
regiment
and
the
street
where
the
house
was
.
you
are
not
what
you
say
returned
da
vout
.
in
a
trembling
faltering
voice
pierre
began
adducing
proofs
of
the
truth
of
his
statements
.
but
at
that
moment
an
adjutant
entered
and
reported
something
to
davout
.
davout
brightened
up
at
the
news
the
ad
jutant
brought
and
began
buttoning
up
his
uniform
.
it
seemed
that
he
had
quite
forgotten
pierre
.
when
the
adjutant
reminded
him
of
the
prisoner
he
jerked
his
head
in
pierres
direc
tion
with
a
frown
and
ordered
him
to
be
led
away
.
but
where
they
were
to
take
him
pierre
did
not
know
back
to
the
coach
house
or
to
the
place
of
execution
his
companions
had
pointed
out
to
him
as
they
crossed
the
virgins
field
.
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
that
the
adju
tant
was
putting
another
question
to
davout
.
yes
of
coursel
replied
davout
but
what
this
yes
meant
pierre
did
not
know
.
pierre
could
not
afterwards
remember
how
he
went
whether
it
was
far
or
in
which
direc
tion
.
his
faculties
were
quite
numbed
he
was
stupefied
and
noticing
nothing
around
him
went
on
moving
his
legs
as
the
others
did
till
they
all
stopped
and
he
stopped
too
.
the
only
thought
in
his
mind
at
that
time
was
who
was
it
that
had
really
sentenced
him
to
death
not
the
men
on
the
commission
that
had
first
ex
amined
him
not
one
of
them
had
wished
to
or
evidently
could
have
done
it
.
it
was
not
davout
who
had
looked
at
him
in
so
human
a
way
.
in
another
moment
davout
would
have
realized
that
he
was
doing
wrong
but
just
then
the
adjutant
had
come
in
and
interrupted
him
.
the
adjutant
also
had
evidently
had
no
evil
intent
though
he
might
have
refrained
from
coming
in
.
then
who
was
executing
him
kill
ing
him
depriving
him
of
life
him
pierre
with
all
his
memories
aspirations
hopes
and
thoughts
who
was
doing
this
and
pierre
felt
that
it
was
no
one
.
it
was
a
system
a
concurrence
of
circum
stances
.
a
system
of
some
sort
was
killing
him
pierre
depriving
him
of
life
of
everything
annihilating
him
.
chapter
xi
from
prince
shcherbjitovs
house
the
pris
oners
were
led
straight
down
the
virgins
field
to
the
left
of
the
nunnery
as
far
as
a
kitchen
55
war
and
peace
garden
in
which
a
post
had
been
set
up
.
be
yond
that
post
a
fresh
pit
had
been
dug
in
the
ground
and
near
the
post
and
the
pit
a
large
crowd
stood
in
a
semicircle
.
the
crowd
con
sisted
of
a
few
russians
and
many
of
napo
leons
soldiers
who
were
not
on
dutyger
mans
italians
and
frenchmen
in
a
variety
of
uniforms
.
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
post
stood
rows
of
french
troops
in
blue
uniforms
with
red
epaulets
and
high
boots
and
shakos
.
the
prisoners
were
placed
in
a
certain
or
der
according
to
the
list
pierre
was
sixth
and
were
led
to
the
post
.
several
drums
sud
denly
began
to
beat
on
both
sides
of
them
and
at
that
sound
pierre
felt
as
if
part
of
his
soul
had
been
torn
away
.
he
lost
the
power
of
thinking
or
understanding
.
he
could
only
hear
and
see
.
and
he
had
only
one
wish
that
the
frightful
thing
that
had
to
happen
should
hap
pen
quickly
.
pierre
looked
round
at
his
fellow
prisoners
and
scrutinized
them
.
the
two
first
were
convicts
with
shaven
heads
.
one
was
tall
and
thin
the
other
dark
shaggy
and
sinewy
with
a
flat
nose
.
the
third
was
a
domestic
serf
about
fortyfive
years
old
with
grizzled
hair
and
a
plump
wellnourished
body
.
the
fourth
was
a
peasant
a
very
handsome
man
with
a
broad
lightbrown
beard
and
black
eyes
.
the
fifth
was
a
factory
hand
a
thin
sallowfaced
lad
of
eighteen
in
a
loose
coat
.
pierre
heard
the
french
consulting
whether
to
shoot
them
separately
or
two
at
a
time
.
in
couples
replied
the
officer
in
command
in
a
calm
voice
.
there
was
a
stir
in
the
ranks
of
the
soldiers
and
it
was
evident
that
they
were
all
hurrying
not
as
men
hurry
to
do
some
thing
they
understand
but
as
people
hurry
to
finish
a
necessary
but
unpleasant
and
incom
prehensible
task
.
a
french
official
wearing
a
scarf
came
up
to
the
right
of
the
row
of
prisoners
and
read
out
the
sentence
in
russian
and
in
french
.
then
two
pairs
of
frenchmen
approached
the
criminals
and
at
the
officers
command
took
the
two
convicts
who
stood
first
in
the
row
.
the
convicts
stopped
when
they
reached
the
post
and
while
sacks
were
being
brought
looked
dumbly
around
as
a
wounded
beast
looks
at
an
approaching
huntsman
.
one
crossed
himself
continually
the
other
scratched
his
back
and
made
a
movement
of
the
lips
resem
bling
a
smile
.
with
hurried
hands
the
soldiers
blindfolded
them
drawing
the
sacks
over
their
heads
and
bound
them
to
the
post
.
twelve
sharpshooters
with
muskets
stepped
out
of
the
ranks
with
a
firm
regular
tread
and
halted
eight
paces
from
the
post
.
pierre
turned
away
to
avoid
seeing
what
was
going
to
hap
pen
.
suddenly
a
crackling
rolling
noise
was
heard
which
seemed
to
him
louder
than
the
most
terrific
thunder
and
he
looked
round
.
there
was
some
smoke
and
the
frenchmen
were
doing
something
near
the
pit
with
pale
faces
and
trembling
hands
.
two
more
prisoners
were
led
up
.
in
the
same
way
and
with
similar
looks
these
two
glanced
vainly
at
the
onlook
ers
with
only
a
silent
appeal
for
protection
in
their
eyes
evidently
unable
to
understand
or
believe
what
was
going
to
happen
to
them
.
they
could
not
believe
it
because
they
alone
knew
what
their
life
meant
to
them
and
so
they
neither
understood
nor
believed
that
it
could
be
taken
from
them
.
again
pierre
did
not
wish
to
look
and
again
turned
away
but
again
the
sound
as
of
a
fright
ful
explosion
struck
his
ear
and
at
the
same
moment
he
saw
smoke
blood
and
the
pale
scared
faces
of
the
frenchmen
who
were
again
doing
something
by
the
post
their
trembling
hands
impeding
one
another
.
pierre
breath
ing
heavily
looked
around
as
if
asking
what
it
meant
.
the
same
question
was
expressed
in
all
the
looks
that
met
his
.
on
the
faces
of
all
the
russians
and
of
the
french
soldiers
and
officers
without
exception
he
read
the
same
dismay
horror
and
conflict
that
were
in
his
own
heart
.
but
who
after
all
is
doing
this
they
are
all
suffering
as
i
am
.
who
then
is
it
who
flashed
for
an
instant
through
his
mind
.
sharpshooters
of
the
86th
forward
i
shouted
someone
.
the
fifth
prisoner
the
one
next
to
pierre
was
led
away
alone
.
pierre
did
not
understand
that
he
was
saved
that
he
and
the
rest
had
been
brought
there
only
to
wit
ness
the
execution
.
with
evergrowing
horror
and
no
sense
of
joy
or
relief
he
gazed
at
what
was
taking
place
.
the
fifth
man
was
the
factory
lad
in
the
loose
cloak
.
the
moment
they
laid
hands
on
him
he
sprang
aside
in
terror
and
clutched
at
pierre
.
pierre
shuddered
and
shook
himself
free
.
the
lad
was
unable
to
walk
.
they
dragged
him
along
holding
him
up
under
the
arms
and
he
screamed
.
when
they
got
him
to
the
post
he
grew
quiet
as
if
he
suddenly
understood
something
.
whether
he
understood
tha
t
screami
ng
was
useless
or
wheth
er
he
thought
it
incredible
that
men
should
kill
him
at
any
rate
he
took
his
stand
at
the
post
waiting
to
be
blindfolded
like
the
others
and
like
a
wounded
animal
looked
around
him
with
glittering
eyes
.
book
twelve
pierre
was
no
longer
able
to
turn
away
and
close
his
eyes
.
his
curiosity
and
agitation
like
that
of
the
whole
crowd
reached
the
highest
pitch
at
this
fifth
murder
.
like
the
others
this
fifth
man
seemed
calm
he
wrapped
his
loose
cloak
closer
and
rubbed
one
bare
foot
with
the
other
.
when
they
began
to
blindfold
him
he
him
self
adjusted
the
knot
which
hurt
the
back
of
his
head
then
when
they
propped
him
against
the
bloodstained
post
he
leaned
back
and
not
being
comfortable
in
that
position
straight
ened
himself
adjusted
his
feet
and
leaned
back
again
more
comfortably
.
pierre
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
him
and
did
not
miss
his
slightest
movement
.
probably
a
word
of
command
was
given
and
was
followed
by
the
reports
of
eight
muskets
but
try
as
he
would
pierre
could
not
afterwards
remember
having
heard
the
slightest
sound
of
the
shots
.
he
only
saw
how
the
workman
sud
denly
sank
down
on
the
cords
that
held
him
how
blood
showed
itself
in
two
places
how
the
ropes
slackened
under
the
weight
of
the
hanging
body
and
how
the
workman
sat
down
his
head
hanging
unnaturally
and
one
leg
bent
under
him
.
pierre
ran
up
to
the
post
.
no
one
hindered
him
.
pale
frightened
people
were
doing
something
around
the
workman
.
the
lower
jaw
of
an
old
frenchman
with
a
thick
mustache
trembled
as
he
untied
the
ropes
.
the
body
collapsed
.
the
soldiers
dragged
it
awk
wardly
from
the
post
and
began
pushing
it
in
to
the
pit
.
they
all
plainly
and
certainly
knew
that
they
were
criminals
who
must
hide
the
traces
of
their
guilt
as
quickly
as
possible
.
pierre
glanced
into
the
pit
and
saw
that
the
factory
lad
was
lying
with
his
knees
close
up
to
his
head
and
one
shoulder
higher
than
the
other
.
that
shoulder
rose
and
fell
rhythmical
ly
and
convulsively
but
spadefuls
of
earth
were
already
being
thrown
over
the
whole
body
.
one
of
the
soldiers
evidently
suffering
shouted
gruffly
and
angrily
at
pierre
to
go
back
.
but
pierre
did
not
understand
him
and
remained
near
the
post
and
no
one
drove
him
away
.
when
the
pit
had
been
filled
up
a
command
was
given
.
pierre
was
taken
back
to
his
place
and
the
rows
of
troops
on
both
sides
of
the
post
made
a
half
turn
and
went
past
it
at
a
measured
pace
.
the
twentyfour
sharpshooters
with
discharged
muskets
standing
in
the
cen
ter
of
the
circle
ran
back
to
their
places
as
the
companies
passed
by
.
pierre
gazed
now
with
dazed
eyes
at
these
55
1
sharpshooters
who
ran
in
couples
out
of
the
circle
.
all
but
one
rejoined
their
companies
.
this
one
a
young
soldier
his
face
deadly
pale
his
shako
pushed
back
and
his
musket
resting
on
the
ground
still
stood
near
the
pit
at
the
spot
from
which
he
had
fired
.
he
swayed
like
a
drunken
man
taking
some
steps
forward
and
back
to
save
himself
from
falling
.
an
old
non
commissioned
officer
ran
out
of
the
ranks
and
taking
him
by
the
elbow
dragged
him
to
his
company
.
the
crowd
of
russians
and
french
men
began
to
disperse
.
they
all
went
away
silently
and
with
drooping
heads
.
that
will
teach
them
to
start
fires
said
one
of
the
frenchmen
.
pierre
glanced
round
at
the
speaker
and
saw
that
it
was
a
soldier
who
was
trying
to
find
some
relief
after
what
had
been
done
but
was
not
able
to
do
so
.
without
finishing
what
he
had
begun
to
say
he
made
a
hopeless
move
ment
with
his
arm
and
went
away
.
chapter
xii
after
the
execution
pierre
was
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
and
placed
alone
in
a
small
ruined
and
befouled
church
.
toward
evening
a
noncommissioned
officer
entered
with
two
soldiers
and
told
him
that
he
had
been
pardoned
and
would
now
go
to
the
barracks
for
the
prisoners
of
war
.
without
un
derstanding
what
was
said
to
him
pierre
got
up
and
went
with
the
soldiers
.
they
took
him
to
the
upper
end
of
the
field
where
there
were
some
sheds
built
of
charred
planks
beams
and
battens
and
led
him
into
one
of
them
.
in
the
darkness
some
twenty
different
men
surround
ed
pierre
.
he
looked
at
them
without
under
standing
who
they
were
why
they
were
there
or
what
they
wanted
of
him
.
he
heard
what
they
said
but
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
the
words
and
made
no
kind
of
deduction
from
or
application
of
them
.
he
replied
to
questions
they
put
to
him
but
did
not
consid
er
who
was
listening
to
his
replies
nor
how
they
would
understand
them
.
he
looked
at
their
faces
and
figures
but
they
all
seemed
to
him
equally
meaningless
.
from
the
moment
pierre
had
witnessed
those
terrible
murders
committed
by
men
who
did
not
wish
to
commit
them
it
was
as
if
the
main
spring
of
his
life
on
which
everything
de
pended
and
which
made
everything
appear
alive
had
suddenly
been
wrenched
out
and
everything
had
collapsed
into
a
heap
of
mean
ingless
rubbish
.
though
he
did
not
acknowl
edge
it
to
himself
his
faith
in
the
right
order
55
war
and
peace
ing
of
the
universe
in
humanity
in
his
own
soul
and
in
god
had
been
destroyed
.
he
had
experienced
this
before
but
never
so
strongly
as
now
.
when
similar
doubts
had
assailed
him
before
they
had
been
the
result
of
his
own
wrongdoing
and
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
had
felt
that
relief
from
his
despair
and
from
those
doubts
was
to
be
found
within
himself
.
but
now
he
felt
that
the
universe
had
crumbled
before
his
eyes
and
only
meaningless
ruins
re
mained
and
this
not
by
any
fault
of
his
own
.
he
felt
that
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
regain
faith
in
the
meaning
of
life
.
around
him
in
the
darkness
men
were
stand
ing
and
evidently
something
about
him
inter
ested
them
greatly
.
they
were
telling
him
something
and
asking
him
something
.
then
they
led
him
away
somewhere
and
at
last
he
found
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
shed
among
men
who
were
laughing
and
talking
on
all
sides
.
well
then
mates

.

.

.
that
very
prince
who

.

.

.
some
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
shed
was
saying
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
word
who
.
sitting
silent
and
motionless
on
a
heap
of
straw
against
the
wall
pierre
sometimes
opened
and
sometimes
closed
his
eyes
.
but
as
soon
as
he
closed
them
he
saw
before
him
the
dreadful
face
of
the
factory
lad
especially
dreadful
be
cause
of
its
simplicity
and
the
faces
of
the
murderers
even
more
dreadful
because
of
their
disquiet
.
and
he
opened
his
eyes
again
and
stared
vacantly
into
the
darkness
around
him
.
beside
him
in
a
stooping
position
sat
a
small
man
of
whose
presence
he
was
first
made
aware
by
a
strong
smell
of
perspiration
which
came
from
him
every
time
he
moved
.
this
man
was
doing
something
to
his
legs
in
the
darkness
and
though
pierre
could
not
see
his
face
he
felt
that
the
man
continually
glanced
at
him
.
on
growing
used
to
the
darkness
pierre
saw
that
the
man
was
taking
off
his
leg
bands
and
the
way
he
did
it
aroused
pierres
interest
.
having
unwound
the
string
that
tied
the
band
on
one
leg
he
carefully
coiled
it
up
and
immediately
set
to
work
on
the
other
leg
glancing
up
at
pierre
.
while
one
hand
hung
up
the
first
string
the
other
was
already
un
winding
the
band
on
the
second
leg
.
in
this
way
having
carefully
removed
the
leg
bands
by
deft
circular
motions
of
his
arm
following
one
another
uninterruptedly
the
man
hung
the
leg
bands
up
on
some
pegs
fixed
above
his
bead
then
he
took
out
a
knife
cut
something
closed
the
knife
placed
it
under
the
head
of
his
bed
and
seating
himself
comfortably
clasped
his
arms
round
his
lifted
knees
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
pierre
.
the
latter
was
con
scious
of
something
pleasant
comforting
and
well
rounded
in
these
deft
movements
in
the
mans
wellordered
arrangements
in
his
corner
and
even
in
his
very
smell
and
he
looked
at
the
man
without
taking
his
eyes
from
him
.
youve
seen
a
lot
of
trouble
sir
eh
the
little
man
suddenly
said
.
and
there
was
so
much
kindliness
and
sim
plicity
in
his
singsong
voice
that
pierre
tried
to
reply
but
his
jaw
trembled
and
he
felt
tears
rising
to
his
eyes
.
the
little
fellow
giving
pierre
no
time
to
betray
his
confusion
instantly
con
tinued
in
the
same
pleasant
tones
eh
lad
dont
fret
said
he
in
the
tender
singsong
caressing
voice
old
russian
peasant
women
employ
.
dont
fret
friendsuffer
an
hour
live
for
an
age
thats
how
it
is
my
dear
fellow
.
and
here
we
live
thank
heaven
with
out
offense
.
among
these
folk
too
there
are
good
men
as
well
as
bad
said
he
and
still
speaking
he
turned
on
his
knees
with
a
supple
movement
got
up
coughed
and
went
off
to
another
part
of
the
shed
.
eh
you
rascal
pierre
heard
the
same
kind
voice
saying
at
the
other
end
of
the
shed
.
so
youve
come
you
rascal
she
remembers
.

.

.

.
now
now
thatll
do
and
the
soldier
pushing
away
a
little
dog
that
was
jumping
up
at
him
returned
to
his
place
and
sat
down
.
in
his
hands
he
had
some
thing
wrapped
in
a
rag
.
here
eat
a
bit
sir
said
he
resuming
his
former
respectful
tone
as
he
unwrapped
and
offered
pierre
some
baked
potatoes
.
we
had
soup
for
dinner
and
the
potatoes
are
grand
pierre
had
not
eaten
all
day
arid
the
smell
of
the
potatoes
seemed
extremely
pleasant
to
him
.
he
thanked
the
soldier
and
began
to
eat
.
well
are
they
all
right
said
the
soldier
with
a
smile
.
you
should
do
like
this
.
he
took
a
potato
drew
out
his
clasp
knife
cut
the
potato
into
two
equal
halves
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
sprinkled
some
salt
on
it
from
the
rag
and
handed
it
to
pierre
.
the
potatoes
are
grandl
he
said
once
more
.
eat
some
like
that
pierre
thought
he
had
never
eaten
anything
that
tasted
better
.
oh
im
all
right
said
he
but
why
did
they
shoot
those
poor
fellows
the
last
one
was
hardly
twenty
.

the
little

what
a
sin
he
added
quickly
and
as
if
his
words
were
always
waiting
ready
in
his
mouth
and
flew
out
involuntarily
he
went
on
how
was
it

didnt
think

pierre
asked
as
he
munched
the
last
of
the
potato
.
i
it
was
last
sunday
they
took
me
out
of
a
hospital
in
moscow
.
why
are
you
a
soldier
then
yes
we
are
soldiers
of
the
apsheron
regi
ment
.
i
was
dying
of
fever
.
we
werent
told
anything
.
there
were
some
twenty
of
us
lying
there
.
we
had
no
idea
never
guessed
at
all
.
and
do
you
feel
sad
here
pierre
inquired
.
how
can
one
help
it
lad
my
name
is
plat
on
and
the
surname
is
karataev
he
added
evidently
wishing
to
make
it
easier
for
pierre
to
address
him
.
they
call
me
little
falcon
in
the
regiment
.
how
is
one
to
help
feeling
sad
moscowshes
the
mother
of
cities
.
how
can
one
see
all
this
and
not
feel
sad
but
the
mag
got
gnaws
the
cabbage
yet
dies
first
thats
what
the
old
folks
used
to
tell
us
he
added
rapidly
.
what
what
did
you
say
asked
pierre
.
who
i
said
karataev
.
i
say
things
hap
pen
not
as
we
plan
but
as
god
judges
he
re
plied
thinking
that
he
was
repeating
what
he
had
said
before
and
immediately
continued
well
and
you
have
you
a
family
estate
sir
and
a
house
so
you
have
abundance
then
and
a
housewife
and
your
old
parents
are
they
still
living
he
asked
.
and
though
it
was
too
dark
for
pierre
to
see
he
felt
that
a
suppressed
smile
of
kindliness
puckered
the
soldiers
lips
as
he
put
these
questions
.
he
seemed
grieved
that
pierre
had
no
parents
especially
that
he
had
no
mother
.
a
wife
for
counsel
a
motherinlaw
for
wel
come
but
theres
none
as
dear
as
ones
own
mother
1
said
he
.
well
and
have
you
little
ones
he
went
on
asking
.
again
pierres
negative
answer
seemed
to
distress
him
and
he
hastened
to
add
never
mind
youre
young
folks
yet
and
please
god
may
still
have
some
.
the
great
thine
is
to
live
in
harmony
.

.

.

.
but
its
all
the
same
now
pierre
could
not
help
saying
.
ah
my
dear
fellow
rejoined
karatdev
never
decline
a
prison
or
a
beggars
sack
he
seated
himself
more
comfortably
and
coughed
evidently
preparing
to
tell
a
long
story
.
well
my
dear
fellow
i
was
still
living
at
home
he
began
.
we
had
a
welltodo
home
stead
plenty
of
land
we
peasants
lived
well
and
our
house
was
one
to
thank
god
for
.
when
father
and
we
went
out
mowing
there
were
seven
of
us
.
we
lived
well
.
we
were
real
peas
ants
.
it
so
happened

.

.

.
and
platon
karatdev
told
a
long
story
of
how
he
had
gone
into
someones
copse
to
take
wood
how
he
had
been
caught
by
the
keeper
had
been
tried
flogged
and
sent
to
serve
as
a
soldier
.
well
lad
and
a
smile
changed
the
tone
of
his
voice
we
thought
it
was
a
misfortune
but
it
turned
out
a
blessing
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
sin
my
brother
would
have
had
to
go
as
a
soldier
.
but
he
my
younger
brother
had
five
little
ones
while
i
you
see
only
left
a
wife
behind
.
we
had
a
little
girl
but
god
took
her
before
i
went
as
a
soldier
.

come
home
on
leave
and
ill
tell
you
how
it
was
i

and

that

are

but
if
plat6n
hadnt
been
shaved
for
a
soldier
michael
would
have
had
to
go
.
he
called
us
all
to
him
and
will
you
believe
it
placed
us
in
front
of
the
icons
.
michael
he
says
come
here
and
bow
down
to
his
feet
and
you
young
woman
you
bow
down
too
and
you

also
bow

says
.

youve
drawn

thats
how
it
is
.
and
plat6n
shifted
his
seat
on
the
straw
.
after
a
short
silence
he
rose
.
well
i
think
you
must
be
sleepy
said
he
and
began
rapidly
crossing
himself
and
repeat
ing

i
he
concluded
554
war
and
peace
then
bowed
to
the
ground
got
up
sighed
and
sat
down
again
on
his
heap
of
straw
.
thats
the
way
.
lay
me
down
like
a
stone
o
god
and
raise
me
up
like
a
loaf
he
muttered
as
he
lay
down
pulling
his
coat
over
him
.
what
prayer
was
that
you
were
saying
asked
pierre
.
eh
murmured
plat6n
who
had
almost
fallen
asleep
.
what
was
i
saying
i
was
pray
ing
.
dont
you
pray
yes
i
do
said
pierre
.
but
what
was
that
you
said
frola
and
lavra
well
of
course
replied
plat6n
quickly
the
horses
saints
.
one
must
pity
the
animals
too
.
eh
the
rascal
now
youve
curled
up
and
got
warm
you
daughter
of
a
bitch
said
kara
tev
touching
the
dog
that
lay
at
his
feet
and
again
turning
over
he
fell
asleep
immediately
.
sounds
of
crying
and
screaming
came
from
somewhere
in
the
distance
outside
and
flames
were
visible
through
the
cracks
of
the
shed
but
inside
it
was
quiet
and
dark
.
for
a
long
time
pierre
did
not
sleep
but
lay
with
eyes
open
in
the
darkness
listening
to
the
regular
snoring
of
plat6n
who
lay
beside
him
and
he
felt
that
the
world
that
had
been
shattered
was
once
more
stirring
in
his
soul
with
a
new
beauty
and
on
new
and
unshakable
founda
tions
.
chapter
xiii
twentythree
soldiers
three
officers
and
two
officials
were
confined
in
the
shed
in
which
pierre
had
been
placed
and
where
he
remained
for
four
weeks
.
when
pierre
remembered
them
afterwards
they
all
seemed
misty
figures
to
him
except
plat6n
karatdev
who
always
remained
in
his
mind
a
most
vivid
and
precious
memory
and
the
personification
of
everything
russian
kindly
and
round
.
when
pierre
saw
his
neigh
bor
next
morning
at
dawn
the
first
impression
of
him
as
of
something
round
was
fully
con
firmed
plat6ns
whole
figure
in
a
french
overcoat
girdled
with
a
cord
a
soldiers
cap
and
bast
shoes
was
round
.
his
head
was
quite
round
his
back
chest
shoulders
and
even
his
arms
which
he
held
as
if
ever
ready
to
em
brace
something
were
rounded
his
pleasant
smile
and
his
large
gentle
brown
eyes
were
also
round
.
plat6n
karataev
must
have
been
fifty
judg
ing
by
his
stories
of
campaigns
he
had
been
in
told
as
by
an
old
soldier
.
he
did
not
himself
know
his
age
and
was
quite
unable
to
deter
mine
it
.
but
his
brilliantly
white
strong
teeth
which
showed
in
two
unbroken
semicircles
when
he
laughed
as
he
often
did
were
all
sound
and
good
there
was
not
a
gray
hair
in
his
beard
or
on
his
head
and
his
whole
body
gave
an
impression
of
suppleness
and
especial
ly
of
firmness
and
endurance
.
his
face
despite
its
fine
rounded
wrinkles
had
an
expression
of
innocence
and
youth
his
voice
was
pleasant
and
musical
.
but
the
chief
peculiarity
of
his
speech
was
its
directness
and
appositeness
.
it
was
evident
that
he
never
con
sidered
what
he
had
said
or
was
going
to
say
and
consequently
the
rapidity
and
justice
of
his
intonation
had
an
irresistible
persuasive
ness
.
his
physical
strength
and
agility
during
the
first
days
of
his
imprisonment
were
such
that
he
seemed
not
to
know
what
fatigue
and
sick
ness
meant
.
every
night
before
lying
down
he
said
lord
lay
me
down
as
a
stone
and
raise
me
up
as
a
loaf
and
every
morning
on
get
ting
up
he
said
i
lay
down
and
curled
up
i
get
up
and
shake
myself
.
and
indeed
he
only
had
to
lie
down
to
fall
asleep
like
a
stone
and
he
only
had
to
shake
himself
to
be
ready
with
out
a
moments
delay
for
some
work
just
as
children
are
ready
to
play
directly
they
awake
.
he
could
do
everything
not
very
well
but
not
badly
.
he
baked
cooked
sewed
planed
and
mended
boots
.
he
was
always
busy
and
only
at
night
allowed
himself
conversation
of
which
he
was
fond
and
songs
.
he
did
not
sing
like
a
trained
singer
who
knows
he
is
listened
to
but
like
the
birds
evidently
giving
vent
to
the
sounds
in
the
same
way
that
one
stretches
one
self
or
walks
about
to
get
rid
of
stiffness
and
the
sounds
were
always
highpitched
mourn
ful
delicate
and
almost
feminine
and
his
face
at
such
times
was
very
serious
.
having
been
taken
prisoner
and
allowed
his
beard
to
grow
he
seemed
to
have
thrown
off
all
that
had
been
forced
upon
him
everything
military
and
alien
to
himself
and
had
returned
to
his
former
peasant
habits
.

he
would

.
he
did
not
like
talking
about
his
life
as
a
soldier
though
he
did
not
complain
and
often
mentioned
that
he
had
not
been
flogged
once
during
the
whole
of
his
army
service
.
when
he
related
anything
it
was
generally
some

and

precious
memory
of

tian
life
as
he
called
his
peasant
existence
.
the
proverbs
of
which
his
talk
was
full
were
for
the
most
part
not
the
coarse
and
indecent
saws
soldiers
employ
but
those
folk
sayings
which
taken
without
a
context
seem
so
insig
nificant
but
when
used
appositely
suddenly
ac
quire
a
significance
of
profound
wisdom
.
he
would
often
say
the
exact
opposite
of
what
he
had
said
on
a
previous
occasion
yet
both
would
be
right
.
he
liked
to
talk
and
he
talked
well
adorning
his
speech
with
terms
of
endearment
and
with
folk
sayings
which
pierre
thought
he
invented
himself
but
the
chief
charm
of
his
talk
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
com
monest
events
sometimes
just
such
as
pierre
had
witnessed
without
taking
notice
of
them
assumed
in
karatdevs
speech
a
character
of
solemn
fitness
.
he
liked
to
hear
the
folk
tales
one
of
the
soldiers
used
to
tell
of
an
evening
they
were
always
the
same
but
most
of
all
he
liked
to
hear
stories
of
real
life
.
he
would
smile
joyfully
when
listening
to
such
stories
now
and
then
putting
in
a
word
or
asking
a
question
to
make
the
moral
beauty
of
what
he
was
told
clear
to
himself
.
karataev
had
no
at
tachments
friendships
or
love
as
pierre
un
derstood
them
but
loved
and
lived
affection
ately
with
everything
life
brought
him
in
con
tact
with
particularly
with
man
not
any
par
ticular
man
but
those
with
whom
he
happened
to
be
.
he
loved
his
dog
his
comrades
the
french
and
pierre
who
was
his
neighbor
but
pierre
felt
that
in
spite
of
karataevs
affection
ate
tenderness
for
him
by
which
he
uncon
sciously
gave
pierres
spiritual
life
its
due
he
would
not
have
grieved
for
a
moment
at
part
ing
from
him
.
and
pierre
began
to
feel
in
the
same
way
toward
karataev
.
to
all
the
other
prisoners
plat6n
karataev
seemed
a
most
ordinary
soldier
.
they
called
him
little
falcon
or
plat6sha
chaffed
him
goodnaturedly
and
sent
him
on
errands
.
but
to
pierre
he
always
remained
what
he
had
seemed
that
first
night
an
unfathomable
rounded
eternal
personification
of
the
spirit
of
simplicity
and
truth
.
plat6n
karataev
knew
nothing
by
heart
ex
cept
his
prayers
.
when
he
began
to
speak
he
seemed
not
to
know
how
he
would
conclude
.
sometimes
pierre
struck
by
the
meaning
of
his
words
would
ask
him
to
repeat
them
but
plat6n
could
never
recall
what
he
had
said
a
moment
before
just
as
he
never
could
repeat
to
pierre
the
words
of
his
favorite
song
native
and
birch
tree
and
my
heart
is
sick
occurred
in
it
but
when
spoken
and
not
sung
no
meaning
could
be
got
out
of
it
.
he
did
not
and
could
not
understand
the
meaning
of
words
apart
from
their
context
.
every
word
and
action
of
his
was
the
manifestation
of
an
activity
un
known
to
him
which
was
his
life
.
but
his
life
as
he
regarded
it
had
no
meaning
as
a
sepa
rate
thing
.
it
had
meaning
only
as
part
of
a
whole
of
which
he
was
always
conscious
.
his
words
and
actions
flowed
from
him
as
evenly
inevitably
and
spontaneously
as
fragrance
ex
hales
from
a
flower
.
he
could
not
understand
the
value
or
significance
of
any
word
or
deed
taken
separately
.
chapter
xiv
when
princess
mary
heard
from
nicholas
that
her
brother
was
with
the
rost6vs
at
yaro
slavl
she
at
once
prepared
to
go
there
in
spite
of
her
aunts
efforts
to
dissuade
her
and
not
merely
to
go
herself
but
to
take
her
nephew
with
her
.
whether
it
were
difficult
or
easy
pos
sible
or
impossible
she
did
not
ask
and
did
not
want
to
know
it
was
her
duty
not
only
herself
to
be
near
her
brother
who
was
perhaps
dying
but
to
do
everything
possible
to
take
his
son
to
him
and
so
she
prepared
to
set
off
.
that
she
had
not
heard
from
prince
andrew
him
self
princess
mary
attributed
to
his
being
too
weak
to
write
or
to
his
considering
the
long
journey
too
hard
and
too
dangerous
for
her
and
his
son
.
in
a
few
days
princess
mary
was
ready
to
start
.
her
equipages
were
the
huge
family
coach
in
which
she
had
traveled
to
voronezh
a
semiopen
trap
and
a
baggage
cart
.
with
her
traveled
mademoiselle
bourienne
little
nich
olas
and
his
tutor
her
old
nurse
three
maids
tikhon
and
a
young
footman
and
courier
her
aunt
had
sent
to
accompany
her
.
the
usual
route
through
moscow
could
not
be
thought
of
and
the
roundabout
way
prin
cess
mary
was
obliged
to
take
through
lipetsk
ryazan
vladimir
and
shuya
was
very
long
and
as
post
horses
were
not
everywhere
ob
tainable
very
difficult
and
near
ryazan
where
the
french
were
said
to
have
shown
themselves
was
even
dangerous
.
during
this
difficult
journey
mademoiselle
bourienne
dessalles
and
princess
marys
serv
ants
were
astonished
at
her
energy
and
firmness
of
spirit
.
she
went
to
bed
later
and
rose
earlier
than
any
of
them
and
no
difficulties
daunted
her
.
thanks
to
her
activity
and
energy
which
infected
her
fellow
travelers
they
approached
yaroslavl
by
the
end
of
the
second
week
.
the
last
days
of
her
stay
in
vor6nezh
had
55
6
been
the
happiest
of
her
life
.
her
love
for
ros
t6v
no
longer
tormented
or
agitated
her
.
it
filled
her
whole
soul
had
become
an
integral
part
of
herself
and
she
no
longer
struggled
against
it
.
latterly
she
had
become
convinced
that
she
loved
and
was
beloved
though
she
never
said
this
definitely
to
herself
in
words
.
she
had
become
convinced
of
it
at
her
last
in
terview
with
nicholas
when
he
had
come
to
tell
her
that
her
brother
was
with
the
rostovs
.
not
by
a
single
word
had
nicholas
alluded
to
the
fact
that
prince
andrews
relations
with
natdsha
might
if
he
recovered
be
renewed
but
princess
mary
saw
by
his
face
that
he
knew
and
thought
of
this
.
yet
in
spite
of
that
his
relation
to
her
con
siderate
delicate
and
loving
not
only
re
mained
unchanged
but
it
sometimes
seemed
to
princess
mary
that
he
was
even
glad
that
the
family
connection
between
them
allowed
him
to
express
his
friendship
more
freely
.
she
knew
that
she
loved
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
her
life
and
felt
that
she
was
beloved
and
was
happy
in
regard
to
it
.
but
this
happiness
on
one
side
of
her
spir
itual
nature
did
not
prevent
her
feeling
grief
for
her
brother
with
full
force
on
the
contrary
that
spiritual
tranquillity
on
the
one
side
made
it
the
more
possible
for
her
to
give
full
play
to
her
feeling
for
her
brother
.
that
feeling
was
so
strong
at
the
moment
of
leaving
voronezh
that
those
who
saw
her
off
as
they
looked
at
her
careworn
despairing
face
felt
sure
she
would
fall
ill
on
the
journey
.
but
the
very
dif
ficulties
and
preoccupations
of
the
journey
which
she
took
so
actively
in
hand
saved
her
fora
while
from
her
grief
and
gave
her
strength
.
as
always
happens
when
traveling
princess
mary
thought
only
of
the
journey
itself
for
getting
its
object
.
but
as
she
approached
yaro
slavl
the
thought
of
what
might
await
her
there
not
after
many
days
but
that
very
eve
ningagain
presented
itself
to
her
and
her
agi
tation
increased
to
its
utmost
limit
.
the
courier
who
had
been
sent
on
in
ad
vance
to
find
out
where
the
rost6vs
were

ing
in

and
in
what
condition
prince
andrew
was
when
he
met
the
big
coach
just
entering
the

was
appalled
by
the
terrible
pallor
of
the

looked

princess

looked
at

with
frightened
inquiry

understanding
why
he
did
not

to
what
she
chiefly
wanted

asked
in

voice
how
is

the
servants
say
he
is
still
the

.
what
still
the

might

princess
mary
did
not
ask
but
with
an
unnoticed
glance
at
little
sevenyearold
nicholas
who
was
sit
ting
in

of
her
looking
with
pleasure
at
the
town
she
bowed
her
head
and
did
not
raise
it
again
till
the
heavy
coach
rumbling
shaking
and
swaying
came
to
a
stop
.
the
carriage
steps
clattered
as
they
were
let
down
.
the
carriage
door
was
opened
.
on
the
left
there
was
water
a
great
river
and
on
the
right
a
porch
.
there
were
people
at
the
entrance
servants
and
a
rosy
girl
with
a
large
plait
of
black
hair
smiling
as
it
seemed
to
princess
mary
in
an
unpleasantly
affected
way

princess

ran
up
the
steps

this

this
wayl
said
the
girl
with
the
same
artificial
smile
and
the
princess
found
herself
in
the
hall
facing
an
elderly
woman
of
oriental
type
who
came
rapidly
to
meet
her
with
a
look
of
emotion
.
this
was
the
countess
.
she
embraced
princess
mary
and
kissed
her
.

she
muttered

vous

.

despite
her
excitement
princess
mary
re
alized
that
this
was
the
countess
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
say
something
to
her
.
hardly
knowing
how
she
did
it
she
contrived
to
utter
a
few
polite
phrases
in
french
in
the
same
tone
as
those
that
had
been
addressed
to
her
and
asked
how
is
he
the
doctor

that
he
is
not
in
danger
said
the
countess
but
as
she
spoke
she
raised
her
eyes
with
a
sigh
and
her
gesture
conveyed
a
contradiction
of
her
words
.

the

ca
ressed
the
boy
and
the
old
count
came
in
and
welcomed
the
princess
.
he
had
changed
very
much
since
princess
mary
had
last
seen
him
.
then
he
had
been
a
brisk
cheerful
selfassured
old
man
now
he
seemed
a
pitiful
bewildered
person
.
while
talking
to
princess
mary
he
con
tinually
looked
round
as
if
asking
everyone
whether
he
was
doing
the
right
thing
.
after
the
destruction
of
moscow
and
of
his
property
thrown
out
of
his
accustomed
groove
he
seemed
to
have
lost
the
sense
of
his
own
significance
and
to
feel
that
there
was
no
longer
a
place
for
him
in
life
.
in
spite
of
her
one
desire
to
see
her
brother
as
soon
as
possible
and
her
vexation
that
at
the
moment
when
all
she
wanted
was
to
see
him

should
be
trying
to
entertain
her
and
pretending
to
admire
her
nephew
the
princess
noticed
all
that
was
going
on
around
her
and
felt
the
necessity
of
submitting
for
a
time
to
this
new
order
of
things
which
she
had
entered
.
she
knew
it
to
be
necessary
and
though
it
was
hard
for
her
she
was
not

with

turned
to

and
trying
to
stifle
the
hostile
feeling
that
arose
in
her
toward
the
girl
she
kissed
her
.
but
she
felt
op
pressed
by
the
fact
that
the
mood
of
everyone
around
her
was
so
far
from
what
was

tears
of
vexation
showed
themselves
in
princess
marys
eyes
.
she
turned
away
and
was
about
to
ask
the
countess
again
how
to
go
to
him
when
light
impetuous
and
seemingly
buoyant
steps
were
heard
at
the
door
.
the
princess
looked
round
and
saw
natdsha
coming
in
almost
running
that
natasha
whom
she
had
liked
so
little
at
their
meeting
in
moscow
long
since
.
but
hardly
had
the
princess
looked
at
na
tdshas
face
before
she
realized
that
here
was
a
real
comrade
in
her
grief
and
consequently
a
friend
.
she
ran
to
meet
her
embraced
her
and
began
to
cry
on
her
shoulder
.
as
soon
as
natdsha
sitting
at
the
head
of
prince
andrews
bed
heard
of
princess
marys
arrival
she
softly
left
his
room
and
hastened
to
557
her
with
those
swift
steps
that
had
sounded
buoyant
to
princess
mary
.
there
was
only
one
expression
on
her
agitat
ed
face
when
she
ran
into
the
drawing
room
that
of
love
boundless
love
for
him
for
her
and
for
all
that
was
near
to
the
man
she
loved
and
of
pity
suffering
for
others
and
passion
ate
desire
to
give
herself
entirely
to
helping
them
.
it
was
plain
that
at
that
moment
there
was
in
natashas
heart
no
thought
of
herself
or
of
her
own
relations
with
prince
andrew
.
princess
mary
with
her
acute
sensibility
understood
all
this
at
the
first
glance
at
nata
shas
face
and
wept
on
her
shoulder
with
sor
rowful
pleasure
.
come
come
to
him
mary
said
natdsha
leading
her
into
the
other
room
.
princess
mary
raised
her
head
dried
her
eyes
and
turned
to
natdsha
.
she
felt
that
from
her
she
would
be
able
to
understand
and
learn
everything
.
how

.

.

.
she
began
her
question
but
stopped
short
.
she
felt
that
it
was
impossible
to
ask
or
to
answer
in
words
.
natashas
face
and
eyes
would
have
to
tell
her
all
more
clearly
and
profound
natdsha
was
gazing
at
her
but
seemed
afraid
and
in
doubt
whether
to
say
all
she
knew
or
not
she
seemed
to
feel
that
before
those
lumi
nous
eyes
which
penetrated
into
the
very
depths
of
her
heart
it
was
impossible
not
to
tell
the
whole
truth
which
she
saw
.
and
sud
denly
natdshas
lips
twitched
ugly
wrinkles
gathered
round
her
mouth
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
she
burst
into
sobs
.
princess
mary
understood
.
but
she
still
hoped
and
asked
in
words
she
herself
did
not
trust

how
is

will
see
was
all
natasha
could
say
.
they
sat
a
little
while
downstairs
near
his
room
till
they
had
left
off
crying
and
were
able
to
go
to
him
with
calm
faces
.
how
has
his
whole
illness
gone
is
it
long
since
he
grew
worse
when
did
this
happen
princess
mary
inquired
.
natdsha
told
her
that
at
first
there
had
been
danger
from
his
feverish
condition
and
the
pain
he
suffered
but
at
tr6itsa
that
had
passed
and
the
doctor
had
only
been
afraid
of
gan
grene
.
that
danger
had
also
passed
.
when
they
reached
yarosldvl
the
wound
had
begun
to
fester
natdsha
knew
all
about
such
things
war
and
peace
as
festering
and
the
doctor
had
said
that
the
festering
might
take
a
normal
course
.
then
fe

set
in

the
doctor
had
said
the
fever
was
not
very
serious

two
days

this
suddenly

natdsha

with
her
sobs

chapter
xv
when
natasha
opened
prince
andrews
door
with
a
familiar
movement
and
let
princess
mary
pass
into
the
room
before
her
the
prin
cess
felt
the
sobs
rising
in
her
throat
.
hard
as
she
had
tried
to
prepare
herself
and
now
tried
to
remain
tranquil
she
knew
that
she
would
be
unable
to
look
at
him
without
tears
.
the
princess
understood
what
natasha
had
meant
by
the
words
two
clays
ago
this
sudden
ly
happened
.
she
understood
those
words
to
mean
that
he
had
suddenly
softened
and
that
this
softening
and
gentleness
were
signs
of
ap
proaching
death
.
as
she
stepped
to
the
door
she
already
saw
in
imagination
andrews
face
as
she
remembered
it
in
childhood
a
gentle
mild
sympathetic
face
which
he
had
rarely
shown
and
which
therefore
affected
her
very
strongly
.
she
was
sure
he
would
speak
soft
tender
words
to
her
such
as
her
father
had
ut
tered
before
his
death
and
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
bear
it
and
would
burst
into
sobs
in
his
presence
.
yet
sooner
or
later
it
had
to
be
and
she
went
in
.
the
sobs
rose
higher
and
higher
in
her
throat
as
she
more
and
more
clearly
distinguished
his
form
and
her
short
sighted
eyes
tried
to
make
out
his
features
and
then
she
saw
his
face
and
met
his
gaze
.
he
was
lying
in
a
squirrelfur
dressing
gown
on
a
divan
surrounded
by
pillows
.
he
was
thin
and
pale
.
in
one
thin
translucently
white
hand
he
held
a
handkerchief
while
with
the
other
he
stroked
the
delicate
mustache
he
had
grown
moving
his
fingers
slowly
.
his
eyes
gazed
at
them
as
they
entered
.
on
seeing
his
face
and
meeting
his
eyes
prin
cess
marys
pace
suddenly
slackened
she
felt
her
tears
dry
up
and
her
sobs
ceased
.
she
sud
denly
felt
guilty
and
grew
timid
on
catching
the
expression
of
his
face
and
eyes
.
but
in
what
am
i
to
blame
she
asked
her
self
.
and
his
cold
stern
look
replied
because
you
are
alive
and
thinking
of
the
living
while
i

..
.
in
the
deep
gaze
that
seemed
to
look
not
out
wards
but
inwards
there
was
an
almost
hostile
expression
as
he
slowly
regarded
his
sister
and
natdsha
.
he
kissed
his
sister
holding
her
hand
in
his
as
was
their
wont
.
how
are
you
mary
how
did
you
manage
to
get
here
said
he
in
a
voice
as
calm
and
aloof
as
his
look
.
had
he
screamed
in
agony
that
scream
would
not
have
struck
such
horror
into
prin
cess
marys
heart
as
the
tone
of
his
voice
.
and
have
you
brought
little
nicholas
he
asked
in
the
same
slow
quiet
manner
and
with
an
obvious
effort
to
remember
.
how
are
you
now
said
princess
mary
herself
surprised
at
what
she
was
saying
.
that
my
dear
you
must
ask
the
doctor
he
replied
and
again
making
an
evident
effort
to
be
affectionate
he
said
with
his
lips
only
his
words
clearly
did
not
correspond
to
his
thoughts

chere
amie

l
princess
mary
pressed
his
hand
.
the
pres
sure
made
him
wince
just
perceptibly
.
he
was
silent
and
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
she
now
understood
what
had
happened
to
him
two
days
before
.
in
his
words
his
tone
and
especially
in
that
calm
almost
antagonistic
look
could
be
felt
an
estrangement
from
every
thing
belonging
to
this
world
terrible
in
one
who
is
alive
.
evidently
only
with
an
effort
did
he
understand
anything
living
but
it
was
obvious
that
he
failed
to
understand
not
because
he
lacked
the
power
to
do
so
but
because
he
understood
something
else
something
the
living
did
not
and
could
not
understand
and
which
wholly
occupied
his
mind
.
there
you
see
how
strangely
fate
has
brought
us
together
said
he
breaking
the
si
lence
and
pointing
to

princess
mary
heard
him
and
did
not
under
stand
how
he
could
say
such
a
thing
.
he
the
sensitive
tender
prince
andrew
how
could
he
say
that
before
her
whom
he

and
who
loved
him
had

expected
to
live
he
could
not
have
said
those
words
in
that
offensively
cold
tone
.
if
he
had
not
known
that
he
was
dying
how
could
he
have
failed
to
pity
her
and
how
could
he
speak
like
that
in
her
presence
the
only
explanation
was
that
he
was
indiffer
ent
because
something

had
been
revealed
to

.
natasha
stopped
.
it
was
impossible
to
talk
.
it
was
plain
that
he
was
making
an
effort
to
lis
ten
but
could
not
do
so
.
yes
they
say
its
burned
he
said
.
its
a
great
pity
and
he
gazed
straight
before
him
absently
stroking
his
mustache
with
his
fingers
.
and
so
you
have
met
count
nicholas
mary
prince
andrew
suddenly
said
evident
ly
wishing
to
speak
pleasantly
to
them
.
he
wrote
here
that
he
took
a
great
liking
to
you
he
went
on
simply
and
calmly
evidently
un
able
to
understand
all
the
complex
significance
his
words
had
for
living
people
.
if
you
liked
him
too
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
you
to
get
married
he
added
rather
more
quickly
as
if
pleased
at
having
found
words
he
had
long
been
seeking
.
princess
mary
heard
his
words
but
they
had
no
meaning
for
her
except
as
a
proof
of
how
far
away
he
now
was
from
everything
living
.
why
talk
of
me
she
said
quietly
and
glanced
at
natasha
.
natsha
who
felt
her
glance
did
not
look
at
her
.
all
three
were
again
silent
.
andrew
would
you
like

princess
mary
suddenly
said
in
a
trembling
voice
would
you
like
to
see
little
nicholas
he
is
always
talking
about
you
prince
andrew
smiled
just
perceptibly
and
for
the
first
time
but
princess
mary
who
knew
his
face
so
well
saw
with
horror
that
he
did
not
smile
with
pleasure
or
affection
for
his
son
but
with
quiet
gentle
irony
because
he
thought
she
was
trying
what
she
believed
to
be
the
last
means
of
arousing
him
.
yes
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
him
.
is
he
quite
well
when
little
nicholas
was
brought
in
to
prince
andrews
room
he
looked
at
his
father
with
frightened
eyes
but
did
not
cry
because
no
one
else
was
crying
.
prince
andrew
kissed
him
and
evidently
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
him
.
when
nicholas
had
been
led
away
princess
mary
again
went
up
to
her
brother
kissed
him
and
unable
to
restrain
her
tears
any
longer
began
to
cry
.
he
looked
at
her
attentively
.
is
it
about
nicholas
he
asked
.
princess
mary
nodded
her
head
weeping
.
mary
you
know
the
gosp

.

.

.
but
he
broke
off
.
what
did
you
say
nothing
.
you
mustnt
cry
here
he
said
looking
at
her
with
the
same
cold
expression
.
when
princess
mary
began
to
cry
he
under
stood
that
she
was
crying
at
the
thought
that
little
nicholas
would
be
left
without
a
father
.
with
a
great
effort
he
tried
toreturn
to
lifeand
to
see
things
from
their
point
of
view
.
yes
to
them
it
must
seem
sadl
he
thought
.
but
how
simple
it
is
.
the
fowls
of
the
air
sow
not
neither
do
they
reap
yet
your
father
feedeth
them
he
said
to
himself
and
wished
to
say
to
princess
mary
but
no
they
will
take
it
their
own
way
they
wont
understand
they
cant
understand
that
all
those
feelings
they
prize
so
all
our
feelings
all
those
ideas
that
seem
so
important
to
us
are
unnecessary
.
we
cannot
understand
one
another
and
he
remained
silent
.
prince
andrews
little
son
was
seven
.
he
could
scarcely
read
and
knew
nothing
.
after
that
day
he
lived
through
many
things
gaining
knowledge
observation
and
experience
but
had
he
possessed
all
the
faculties
he
afterwards
acquired
he
could
not
have
had
a
better
or
more
profound
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
the
scene
he
had
witnessed
between
his
fa
ther
mary
and
natasha
than
he
had
then
.
he
understood
it
completely
and
leaving
the
room
without
crying
went
silently
up
to
natdsha
who
had
come
out
with
him
and
looked
shyly
at
her
with
his
beautiful
thoughtful
eyes
then
his
uplifted
rosy
upper
lip
trembled
and
lean
ing
his
head
against
her
he
began
to
cry
.
after
that
he
avoided
dessalles
and
the
countess
who
caressed
him
and
either
sat
alone
or
came
timidly
to
princess
mary
or
to
na
tasha
of
whom
he
seemed
even
fonder
than
of
his
aunt
and
clung
to
them
quietly
and
shyly
.
when
princess
mary
had
left
prince
an
drew
she
fully
understood
what
natdshas
face
had
told
her
.
she
did
not
speak
any
more
to
natdsha
of
hopes
of
saving
his
life
.
she
took
turns
with
her
beside
his
sofa
and
did
not
cry
any
more
but
prayed
continually
turning
in
soul
to
that
eternal
and
unfathomable
whose
presence
above
the
dying
man
was
now
so
evi
dent
.

not
only
did
prince
andrew
know
he
would
die
but
he
felt
that
he
was
dying
and
was
al
ready
half
dead
.
he
was
conscious
of
an
aloof
ness
from
everything
earthly
and
a
strange
and
joyous
lightness
of
existence
.
without
haste
or
agitation
he
awaited
what
was
coming
.
that
inexorable
eternal
distant
and
unknown
the
presence
of
which
he
had
felt
continually
all
his
life
was
now
near
to
him
and
by
the
strange
lightness
he
experienced
almost
com
prehensible
and
palpable
.

.

.

.
formerly
he
had
feared
the
end
.
he
had
twice
experienced
that
terribly
tormenting
fear
of
death
the
end
but
now
he
no
longer
understood
that
fear
.
he
had
felt
it
for
the
first
time
when
the
shell
spun
like
a
top
before
him
and
he
looked
at
the
fallow
field
the
bushes
and
the
sky
and
knew
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
death
.
when
he
came
to
himself
after
being
wounded
and
the
flower
of
eternal
unfettered
love
had
in
stantly
unfolded
itself
in
his
soul
as
if
freed
from
the
bondage
of
life
that
had
restrained
it
he
no
longer
feared
death
and
ceased
to
think
about
it
.
during
the
hours
of
solitude
suffering
and
partial
delirium
he
spent
after
he
was
wound
ed
the
more
deeply
he
penetrated
into
the
new
principle
of
eternal
love
revealed
to
him
the
more
he
unconsciously
detached
himself
from
earthly
life
.
to
love
everything
and
ev
erybody
and
always
to
sacrifice
oneself
for
love
meant
not
to
love
anyone
not
to
live
this
earth
ly
life
.
and
the
more
imbued
he
became
with
that
principle
of
love
the
more
he
renounced
life
and
the
more
completely
he
destroyed
that
dreadful
barrier
which
in
the
absence
of
such
love
stands
between
life
and
death
.
when
during
those
first
days
he
remembered
that
he
would
have
to
die
he
said
to
himself
well
what
of
it
so
much
the
better
but
after
the
night
in
mytishchi
when
half
delirious
he
had
seen
her
for
whom
he
longed
appear
before
him
and
having
pressed
her
hand
to
his
lips
had
shed
gentle
happy
tears
love
for
a
particular
woman
again
crept
un
observed
into
his
heart
and
once
more
bound
him
to
life
.
and
joyful
and
agitating
thoughts
began
to
occupy
his
mind
.
recalling
the
mo
ment
at
the
ambulance
station
when
he
had
seen
kuragin
he
could
not
now
regain
the
feeling
he
then
had
but
was
tormented
by
the
question
whether
kurdgin
was
alive
.
and
he
dared
not
inquire
.
war
and
peace
his
illness
pursued
its
normal
physical
course
but
what
natdsha
referred
to
when
she
said
this
suddenly
happened
had
occurred
two
days
before
princess
mary
arrived
.
it
was
the
last
spiritual
struggle
between
life
and
death
in
which
death
gained
the
victory
.
it
was
the
unexpected
realization
of
the
fact
that
he
still
valued
life
as
presented
to
him
in
the
form
of
his
love
for
natdsha
and
a
last
though
ultimately
vanquished
attack
of
terror
before
the
unknown
.
it
was
evening
.
as
usual
after
dinner
he
was
slightly
feverish
and
his
thoughts
were
pre
ternaturally
clear
.
s6nya
was
sitting
by
the
table
.
he
began
to
doze
.
suddenly
a
feeling
of
happiness
seized
him
.
ah
she
has
come
thought
he
.
and
so
it
was
in
s6nyas
place
sat
natasha
who
had
just
come
in
noiselessly
.
since
she
had
begun
looking
after
him
he
had
always
experienced
this
physical
consciousness
of
her
nearness
.
she
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
placed
sideways
screening
the
light
of
the
can
dle
from
him
and
was
knitting
a
stocking
.
she
had
learned
to
knit
stockings
since
prince
andrew
had
casually
mentioned
that
no
one
nursed
the
sick
so
well
as
old
nurses
who
knit
stockings
and
that
there
is
something
soothing
in
the
knitting
of
stockings
.
the
needles
clicked
lightly
in
her
slender
rapidly
moving
hands
and
he
could
clearly
see
the
thoughtful
profile
of
her
drooping
face
.
she
moved
and
the
ball
rolled
off
her
knees
.
she
started
glanced
round
at
him
and
screening
the
candle
with
her
hand
stooped
carefully
with
a
supple
and
exact
movement
picked
up
the
ball
and
regained
her
former
position
.
he
looked
at
her
without
moving
and
saw
that
she
wanted
to
draw
a
deep
breath
after
stooping
but
refrained
from
doing
so
and
breathed
cautiously
.
at
the
troitsa
monastery
they
had
spoken
of
the
past
and
he
had
told
her
that
if
he
lived
he
would
always
thank
god
for
his
wound
which
had
brought
them
together
again
but
after
that
they
never
spoke
of
the
future
.
can
it
or
can
it
not
be
he
now
thought
as
he
looked
at
her
and
listened
to
the
light
click
of
the
steel
needles
.
can
fate
have
brought
me
to
her
so
strangely
only
for
me
to
die

..
.
is
it
possible
that
the
truth
of
life
has
been
revealed
to
me
only
to
show
me
that
i
have
spent
my
life
in
falsity
i
love
her
more
than
anything
in
the
world
but
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
love
her
he
thought
and
he
involun
book
twelve
tarily
groaned
from
aiabit
acquired
during
his
sufferings
.
on
hearing
that
sound
natdsha
put
down
the
stocking
leaned
nearer
to
him
and
sud
denly
noticing
his
shining
eyes
stepped
light
ly
up
to
him
and
bent
over
him
.
you
are
not
asleep
no
i
have
been
looking
at
you
a
long
time

i

you

tranquillity

that

i

for

.
natdsha
drew
closer
to
him
.
her
face
shone
with
rapturous
joy
.
natdsha
i
love
you
too
muchl
more
than
anything
in
the
world
.
and
i
she
turned
away
for
an
instant
.
why
too
much
she
asked
.
why
too
much

.


.
well
what
do
you
think
what

natdsha
almost
shout
ed
taking
hold
of
both
his
hands
with
a
pas
sionate
movement
.
he
remained
silent
awhile
.
how
good
it
would
be
and
taking
her
hand
he
kissed
it
.
natasha
felt
happy
and
agitated
but
at
once
remembered
that
this
would
not
do
and
that
he
had
to
be
quiet
.
but
you
have
not
slept
she
said
repress
ing
her
joy
.

.

.
please
he
pressed
her
hand
and
released
it
and
she
went
back
to
the
candleand
sat
down
again
in
her
former
position
.
twice
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
and
her
eyes
met
his
beaming
at
her
.
she
set
herself
a
task
on
her
stocking
and
resolved
not
to
turn
round
till
it
was
fin
ished
.
soon
he
really
shut
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
.
he
did
not
sleep
long
and
suddenly
awoke
with
a
start
and
in
a
cold
perspiration
.
as
he
fell
asleep
he
had
still
been
thinking
of
the
subject
that
now
always
occupied
his
mind
about
life
and
death
and
chiefly
about
death
.
he
felt
himself
nearer
to
it
.
love
what
is
love
he
thought
.
love
hinders
death
.
love
is
life
.
all
every
thing
that
i
understand
i
understand
only
because
i
love
.
everything
is
everything
ex
ists
only
because
1
love
.
everything
is
united
by
it
alone
.
love
is
god
and
to
die
means
that
i
a
particle
of
love
shall
return
to
the
general
and
eternal
source
.
these
thoughts
seemed
to
him
comforting
.
but
they
were
only
thoughts
.
something
was
lacking
in
them
they
were
not
clear
they
were
too
onesidedly
personal
and
561
brainspun
.
and
there
was
the
former
agita
tion
and
obscurity
.
he
fell
asleep
.
he
dreamed
that
he
was
lying
in
the
room
he
really
was
in
but
that
hewas
quite
well
and
un
wounded
.
many
various
indifferent
and
insig
nificant
people
appeared
before
him
.
he
talked
to
them
and
discussed
something
trivial
.
they
were
preparing
to
go
away
somewhere
.
prince
andrew
dimly
realized
that
all
this
was
trivial
and
that
he
had
more
important
cares
but
he
continued
to
speak
surprising
them
by
empty
witticisms
.
gradually
unnoticed
all
these
per
sons
began
to
disappear
and
a
single
question
that
of
the
closed
door
superseded
all
else
.
he
rose
and
went
to
the
door
to
bolt
and
lock
it
.
everything
depended
on
whether
he
was
or
was
not
in
time
to
lock
it
.
he
went
and
tried
to
hurry
but
his
legs
refused
to
move
and
he
knew
he
would
not
be
in
time
to
lock
the
door
though
he
painfullystrained
all
his
powers
.
he
was
seized
by
an
agonizing
fear
.
and
that
fear
was
the
fear
of
death
.
it
stood
behind
the
door
.
but
just
when
he
was
clumsily
creeping
to
ward
the
door
that
dreadful
something
on
the
other
side
was
already
pressing
against
it
and
forcing
its
way
in
.
something
not
hu
mandeathwas
breaking
in
through
that
door
and
had
to
be
kept
out
.
he
seized
the
door
making
a
final
effort
to
hold
it
back
to
lock
it
was
no
longer
possible
but
his
efforts
were
weak
and
clumsy
and
the
door
pushed
from
behind
by
that
terror
opened
and
closed
again
.
once
again
it
pushed
from
outside
.
his
last
superhuman
efforts
were
vain
and
both
halves
of
the
door
noiselessly
opened
.
it
entered
and
it
was
death
and
prince
andrew
died
.
but
at
the
instant
he
died
prince
andrew
re
membered
that
he
was
asleep
and
at
the
very
instant
he
died
having
made
an
effort
he
awoke
.
yes
it
was
death
i
died
and
woke
up
.
yes
death
is
an
awakening
and
all
at
once
it
grew
light
in
his
soul
and
the
veil
that
had
till
then
concealed
the
unknown
was
lifted
from
his
spiritual
vision
.
he
felt
as
if
powers
till
then
confined
within
him
had
been
liberated
and
that
strange
lightness
did
not
again
leave
him
.
when
waking
in
a
cold
perspiration
he
moved
on
the
divan
natdsha
went
up
and
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
.
he
did
not
answer
and
looked
at
her
strangely
not
under
standing
.
that
was
what
had
happened
to
him
two
days
before
princess
marys
arrival
.
from
that
56
day
as
the
doctor
expressed
it
the
wasting
fever
assumed
a
malignant
character
but
what
the
doctor
said
did
not
interest
natasha
she
saw
the
terrible
moral
symptoms
which
to
her
were
more
convincing
.
from
that
day
an
awakening
from
life
came
to
prince
andrew
together
with
his
awakening
from
sleep
.
and
compared
to
the
duration
of
life
it
did
not
seem
to
him
slower
than
an
awakening
from
sleep
compared
to
the
dura
tion
of
a
dream

there
was
nothing
terrible
or
violent
in
this
comparatively
slow
awakening
.
his
last
days
and
hours
passed
in
an
ordinary
and
simple
way
.
both
princess
mary
and
na
tdsha
who
did
not
leave
him
felt
this
.
they
did
not
weep
or
shudder
and
during
these
last
days
they
themselves
felt
that
they
were
not
attending
on
him
he
was
no
longer
there
he
had
left
them
but
on
what
reminded
them
most
closely
of
him
his
body
.
both
felt
this
so
strongly
that
the
outward
and
terrible
side
of
death
did
not
affect
them
and
they
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
foment
their
grief
.
neither
in
his
presence
nor
out
of
it
did
they
weep
nor
did
they
ever
talk
to
one
another
about
him
.
they
felt
that
they
could
not
express
in
words
what
they
understood
.
they
both
saw
that
he
was
sinking
slowly
and
quietly
deeper
and
deeper
away
from
them
and
they
both
knew
that
this
had
to
be
so
and
that
it
was
right
.
he
confessed
and
received
communion
ev
eryone
came
to
take
leave
of
him
.
when
they
brought
his
son
to
him
he
pressed
his
lips
to
war
and
peace
the
boys
and
turnectaway
not
because
he
felt
it
hard
and
sad
princess
mary
and
nat
sha
understood
that
but
simply
because
he
thought
it
was
all
that
was
required
of
him
but
when
they
told
him
to
bless
the
boy
he
did
what
was
demanded
and
looked
round
as
if
asking
whether
there
was
anything
else
he
should
do
.
when
the
last
convulsions
of
the
body
which
the
spirit
was
leaving
occurred
princess
mary
and
natdsha
were
present
.
is
it
over
said
princess
mary
when
his
body
had
for
a
few
minutes
lain
motionless
growing
cold
before
them
.
natdsha
went
up
looked
at
the
dead
eyes
and
hastened
to
close
them
.
she
closed
them
but
did
not
kiss
them
but
clung
to
that
which
reminded
her
most
nearly
of
him
his
body
.
where
has
he
gone
where
is
he
now

.

.
when
the
body
washed
and
dressed
lay
in
the
coffin
on
a
table
everyone
came
to
take
leave
of
him
and
they
all
wept
.
little
nicholas
cried
because
his
heart
was
rent
by
painful
perplexity
.
the
countess
and
s6nya
cried
from
pity
for
natasha
and
because
he
was
no
more
.
the
old
count
cried
because
he
felt
that
before
long
he
too
must
take
the
same
terrible
step
.
natdsha
and
princess
mary
also
wept
now
but
not
because
of
their
own
personal
grief
they
wept
with
a
reverent
and
softening
emo
tion
which
had
taken
possession
of
their
souls
at
the
consciousness
of
the
simple
and
solemn
mystery
of
death
that
had
been
accomplished
in
their
presence
.

i
mans
mind
cannot
grasp
the
causes
of
events
in
their
completeness
but
the
desire
to
find
those
causes
is
implanted
in
mans
soul
.
and
without
considering
the
multiplicity
and
com
plexity
of
the
conditions
any
one
of
which
taken
separately
may
seem
to
be
the

he
snatches
at
the
first
approximation
to
a
cause
that
seems
to
him
intelligible
and
says
this
is
the
cause
in
historical
events
where
the
actions
of
men
are
the
subject
of
observation
the
first
and
most
primitive
approximation
to
present
itself
was
the
will
of
the
gods
and
aft
er
that
the
will
of
those
who
stood
in
the
most
prominent
position
the
heroes
of
history
.
but
we
need
only
penetrate
to
the
essence
of
any
historic
event
which
lies
in
the
activity
of
the
general
mass
of
men
who
take
part
in
it
to
be
convinced
that
the
will
of
the
historic
hero
does
not
control
the
actions
of
the
mass
but
is
itself
continually
controlled
.
it
may
seem
to
be
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
we
under
stand
die
meaning
of
historical
events
this
way
or
that
yet
there
is
the
same
difference
between
a
man
who
says
that
the
people
of
the
west
moved
on
the
east
because
napoleon
wished
it
and
a
man
who
says
that
this
hap
pened
because
it
had
to
happen
as
there
is
be
tween
those
who
declared
that
the
earth
was
stationary
and
that
the
planets
moved
round
it
and
those
who
admitted
that
they
did
not
know
what
upheld
the
earth
but
knew
there
were
laws
directing
its
movement
and
that
of
the
other
planets
.
there
is
and
can
be
no
cause
of
an
historical
event
except
the
one
cause
of
all
causes
.
but
there
are
laws
direct
ing
events
and
some
of
these
laws
are
known
to
us
while
we
are
conscious
of
others
we
can
not
comprehend
.
the
discovery
of
these
laws
is
only
possible
when
we
have
quite
abandoned
the
attempt
to
find
the
cause
in
the
will
of
some
one
man
just
as
the
discovery
of
the
laws
of
the
motion
of
the
planets
was
possible
only
when
men
abandoned
the
conception
of
the
fixity
of
the
earth
.
the
historians
consider
that
next
to
the
battle
of
borodin6
and
the
occupation
of
mos
cow
by
the
enemy
and
its
destruction
by
fire
the
most
important
episode
of
the
war
of
1812
was
the
movement
of
the
russian
army
from
the
ryazan
to
the
kaluga
road
and
to
the
tarutino
camp
the
socalled
flank
march
across
the
krdsnaya
fakhra
river
.
they
as
cribe
the
glory
of
that
achievement
of
genius
to
different
men
and
dispute
as
to
whom
the
honor
is
due
.
even
foreign
historians
includ
ing
the
french
acknowledge
the
genius
of
the
russian
commanders
when
they
speak
of
that
rank
march
.
but
it
is
hard
to
understand
why
military
writers
and
following
them
others
consider
this
flank
march
to
be
the
profound
conception
of
some
one
man
who
saved
rus
sia
and
destroyed
napoleon
.
in
the
first
place
it
is
hard
to
understand
where
the
profundity
and
genius
of
this
movement
lay
for
not
much
mental
effort
was
needed
to
see
that
the
best
position
for
an
army
when
it
is
not
being
at
tacked
is
where
there
are
most
provisions
and
even
a
dull
boy
of
thirteen
could
have
guessed
that
the
best
position
for
an
army
after
its
re
treat
from
moscow
in
1812
was
on
the
kaluga
road
.
so
it
is
impossible
to
understand
by
what
reasoning
the
historians
reach
the
conclusion
that
this
maneuver
was
a
profound
one
.
and
it
is
even
more
difficult
to
understand
just
why
they
think
that
this
maneuver
was
calculated
to
save
russia
and
destroy
the
french
for
this
flank
march
had
it
been
preceded
accom
panied
or
followed
by
other
circumstances
might
have
proved
ruinous
to
the
russians
and
salutary
for
the
french
.
if
the
position
of
the
russian
army
really
began
to
improve
from
the
time
of
that
march
it
does
not
at
all
follow
that
the
march
was
the
cause
of
it
.
that
flank
march
might
not
only
have
failed
to
give
any
advantage
to
the
russian
army
but
might
in
other
circumstances
have
led
to
its
destruction
.
what
would
have
happened
had
moscow
not
burned
down
if
murat
had
not
lost
sight
of
the
russians
if
napoleon
had
563
564
not
remained
inactive
if
the
russian
army
at
krasnaya
fakhra
had
given
battle
as
berinig
sen
and
barclay
advised
what
would
have
happened
had
the
french
attacked
the
rus
sians
while
they
were
marching
beyond
the
fakhra
what
would
have
happened
if
on
ap
proaching
tarutino
napoleon
had
attacked
the
russians
with
but
a
tenth
of
the
energy
he
had
shown
when
he
attacked
them
at
smo
lensk
what
would
have
happened
had
the
french
moved
on
petersburg

..
.
in
any
of
these
eventualities
the
flank
march
that
brought
salvation
might
have
proved
disastrous
.
the
third
and
most
incomprehensible
thing
is
that
people
studying
history
deliberately
avoid
seeing
that
this
flank
march
cannot
be
attributed
to
any
one
man
that
no
one
ever
foresaw
it
and
that
in
reality
like
the
retreat
from
fill
it
did
not
suggest
itself
to
anyone
in
its
entirety
but
resultedmoment
by
moment
step
by
step
event
by
event
from
an
endless
number
of
most
diverse
circumstances
and
was
only
seen
in
its
entirety
when
it
had
been
ac
complished
and
belonged
to
the
past
.
at
the
council
at
fili
the
prevailing
thought
in
the
minds
of
the
russian
commanders
was
the
one
naturally
suggesting
itself
namely
a
direct
retreat
by
the
nizhni
road
.
in
proof
of
this
there
is
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
the
council
voted
for
such
a
retreat
and
above
all
there
is
the
wellknown
conversation
after
the
council
between
the
commander
in
chief
and
lansk6y
who
was
in
charge
of
the
commissa
riat
department
.
lanskoy
informed
the
com
mander
in
chief
that
the
army
supplies
were
for
the
most
part
stored
along
the
oka
in
the
tula
and
ryazan
provinces
and
that
if
they
re
treated
on
nizhni
the
army
would
be
separated
from
its
supplies
by
the
broad
river
oka
which
cannot
be
crossed
early
in
winter
.
this
was
the
first
indication
of
the
necessity
of
deviating
from
what
had
previously
seemed
the
most
natural
course
a
direct
retreat
on
nizhni
n6vgorod
.the
army
turned
more
to
the
south
along
the
ryazan
road
and
nearer
to
its
sup
plies
.
subsequently
the
inactivity
of
the
french
who
even
lost
sight
of
the
russian
army
con
cern
for
the
safety
of
the
arsenal
at
tula
and
especially
the
advantages
of
drawing
nearer
to
its
supplies
caused
thearmy
to
turn
still
further
south
to
the
tula
road
.
having
crossed
over
by
a
forced
march
to
the
tula
road
beyond
the
fakhra
the
russian
commanders
intended
to
remain
at
podolsk
and
had
no
thought
of
the
tartitino
position
but
innumerable
circum
stances
and
the
reappearance
of
french
troops
war
and
peace
who
had
for
a
time
lost
touch
with
the
rus
sians
and
projects
of
giving
battle
and
above
all
the
abundance
of
provisions
in
kaluga
province
obliged
our
army
to
turn
still
more
to
the
south
and
to
cross
from
the
tula
to
the
kaluga
road
and
go
totariitino
which
was
be
tween
the
roads
along
which
those
supplies
lay
.
just
as
it
is
impossible
to
say
when
it
was
decided
to
abandon
moscow
so
it
is
impossible
to
say
precisely
when
or
by
whom
it
was
de
cided
to
move
to
tarutino
.
only
when
the
army
had
got
there
as
the
result
of
innumer
able
and
varying
forces
did
people
begin
to
assure
themselves
that
they
had
desired
this
movement
and
long
ago
foreseen
its
result
.
chapter
ii
the
famous
flank
movement
merely
consist
ed
in
this
after
the
advance
of
the
french
had
ceased
the
russian
army
which
had
been
con
tinually
retreating
straight
back
from
the
in
vaders
deviated
from
that
direct
course
and
not
finding
itself
pursued
was
naturally
drawn
toward
the
district
where
supplies
were
abun
dant
.
if
instead
of
imagining
to
ourselves
com
manders
of
genius
leading
the
russian
army
we
picture
that
army
without
any
leaders
it
could
not
have
done
anything
but
make
a
re
turn
movement
toward
moscow
describing
an
arc
in
the
direction
where
most
provisions
were
to
be
found
and
where
the
country
was
richest
.
that
movement
from
the
nizhni
to
the
ry
azdn
tula
and
kaluga
roads
was
so
natural
that
even
the
russian
marauders
moved
in
that
direction
and
demands
were
sent
from
peters
burg
for
kutuzov
to
take
his
army
that
way
.
at
tarutino
kutuzov
received
what
was
almost
a
reprimand
from
the
emperor
for
having
moved
his
army
along
the
ryazan
road
and
the
emperors
letter
indicated
to
him
the
very
po
sition
he
had
already
occupied
near
kaluga
.
having
rolled
like
a
ball
in
the
direction
of
the
impetus
given
by
the
whole
campaign
and
by
the
battle
of
borodin6
the
russian
army
when
the
strength
of
that
impetus
was
exhaust
ed
and
no
fresh
push
was
received
assumed
the
position
natural
to
it
.
kutuzovs
merit
lay
not
in
any
strategic
ma
neuver
of
genius
as
it
is
called
but
in
the
fact
that
he
alone
understood
the
significance
of
what
had
happened
.
he
alone
then
understood
the
meaning
of
the
french
armys
inactivity
he
alone
continued
to
assert
that
the
battle
of
borodin6
had
been
a
victory
he
alone
who
as
commander
in
chief
might
have
been
expected
to
be
eager
to
attack
employed
his
whole
strength
to
restrain
the
russian
army
from
use
less
engagements
.
the
beast
wounded
at
borodin6
was
lying
where
the
fleeing
hunter
had
left
him
but
whether
he
was
still
alive
whether
he
was
strong
and
merely
lying
low
the
hunter
did
not
know
.
suddenly
the
beast
was
heard
to
moan
.
the
moan
of
that
wounded
beast
the
french
army
which
betrayed
its
calamitous
condition
was
the
sending
of
lauriston
to
ku

camp
with
overtures
for

.
napoleon
with
his
usual
assurance
that
whatever
entered
his
head
was
right
wrote
to
kutuzov
the
first
words
that
occurred
to
him
though
they
were
meaningless
.

but
he
continued
to
exert
all
his
powers
to
restrain
his
troops
from
at
tacking
.
during
the
month
that
the
french
troops
were
pillaging
in
moscow
and
the
russian
troops
were
quietly
encamped
at
tariitino
a
change
had
taken
place
in
the
relative
strength
of
the
two
armies
both
in
spirit
and
in
num

a
result
of
which

superiority
had
passed
to

though
the
condi

and

were
un
known
to
the

as
soon
as

the

itself

in

has
been

doing
the

that
lay
in

heart

as
long
as

were
in

above

mind
that

there
was

at

was
shown
by
an
in
creased
activity
whirring
and
chiming
in
the
higher
spheres
.
chapter
iii
the
russian
army
was
commanded
by
kutu
zov
and
his
staff
and
also
by
the
emperor
from
petersburg
.
before
the
news
of
the
abandon
ment
of
moscow
had
been
received
in
peters
burg
a
detailed
plan
of
the
whole
campaign
had
been
drawn
up
and
sent
to
kutuzov
for
his
guidance
.
though
this
plan
had
been
drawn
up
on
the
supposition
that
moscow
was
still
in
our
hands
it
was
approved
by
the
staff
and
accepted
as
a
basis
for
action
.
kutu
zov
only
replied
that
movements
arranged
from
a
distance
were
always
difficult
to
execute
.
so
fresh
instructions
were
sent
for
the
solu
tion
of
difficulties
that
might
be
encountered
as
well
as
fresh
people
who
were
to
watch
ku
tiizovs
actions
and
report
upon
them
.
besides
this
the
whole
staff
of
the
russian
army
was
now
reorganized
.
the
posts
left
va
cant
by
bagrati6n
who
had
been
killed
and
by
barclay
who
had
gone
away
in
dudgeon
had
to
be
filled
.
very
serious
consideration
was
given
to
the
question
whether
it
would
be
better
to
put
a
in
bs
place
and
b
in
ds
or
on
the
contrary
to
put
d
in
as
place
and
so
on
as
if
anything
more
than
as
or
bs
satisfaction
depended
on
this
.
as
a
result
of
the
hostility
between
kutuzov
and
bennigsen
his
chief
of
staff
the
presence
of
confidential
representatives
of
the
emperor
and
these
transfers
a
more
than
usually
com
plicated
play
of
parties
was
going
on
among
the
staff
of
the
army
.
a
was
undermining
b
d
was
undermining
c
and
so
on
in
all
possi
ble
combinations
and
permutations
.
in
all
these
plottings
the
subject
of
intrigue
was
gen
erally
the
conduct
of
the
war
which
all
these
men
believed
they
were
directing
but
this
af
fair
of
the
war
went
on
independently
of
them
5

war
and
peace
as
it
had
to
go
that
is
never
in
the
way
peo
ple
devised
but
flowing
always
from
the
es
sential
attitude
of
the
masses
.
only
in
the
high
est
spheres
did
all
these
schemes
crossings
and
interminglings
appear
to
be
a
true
reflection
of
what
had
to
happen
.
prince
michael
ilarionovich
wrote
the
em
peror
on
the
second
of
october
in
a
letter
that
reached
kutuzov
after
the
battle
at
tarutino
since
september
2
moscow
has
been
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
.
your
last
reports
were
written
on
the
twentieth
and
during
all
this
time
not
only
has
no
action
been
taken
against
the
enemy
or
for
the
relief
of
the
ancient
capital
but
according
to
your
last
report
you
have
even
retreated
farther
.
serpukhov
is
already
occupied
by
an
enemy
de
tachment
and
tula
with
its
famous
arsenal
so
in
dispensable
to
the
army
is
in
danger
.
from
gen
eral
wintzingerodes
reports
i
see
lhat
an
enemy
corps
of
ten
thousand
men
is
moving
on
the
peters
burg
road
.
another
corps
of
several
thousand
men
is
moving
on
dmftrov
.
a
third
has
advanced
along
the
vladimir
road
and
a
fourth
rather
consider
able
detachment
is
stationed
between
ruza
and
mozhaysk
.
napoleon
himself
was
in
moscow
as
late
as
the
twentyfifth
.
in
view
of
all
this
informa
tion
when
the
enemy
has
scattered
his
forces
in
large
detachments
and
with
napoleon
and
his
guards
in
moscow
is
it
possible
that
the
enemys
forces
confronting
you
are
so
considerable
as
not
to
allow
of
your
taking
the
offensive
on
the
con
trary
he
is
probably
pursuing
you
with
detach
ments
or
at
most
with
an
army
corps
much
weaker
than
the
army
entrusted
to
you
.
it
would
seem
that
availing
yourself
of
these
circumstances
you
might
advantageously
attack
a
weaker
enemy
and
annihilate
him
or
at
least
oblige
him
to
re
treat
retaining
in
our
hands
an
important
part
of
the
provinces
now
occupied
by
the
enemy
and
thereby
averting
danger
from
tula
and
other
towns
in
the
interior
.
you
will
be
responsible
if
the
enemy
is
able
to
direct
a
force
of
any
sie
against
petersburg
to
threaten
this
capital
in
which
it
has
not
been
possible
to
retain
many
troops
for
with
the
army
entrusted
to
you
and
acting
with
resolution
and
energy
you
have
ample
means
to
avert
this
fresh
calamity
.
remember
that
you
have
still
to
answer
to
our
offended
country
for
the
loss
of
moscow
.
you
have
experi
enced
my
readiness
to
reward
you
.
that
readiness
will
not
weaken
in
me
but
i
and
russia
have
a
right
to
expect
from
you
all
the
zeal
firmness
and
success
which
your
intellect
military
talent
and
the
courage
of
the
troops
you
command
justify
us
in
expecting
.
but
by
the
time
this
letter
which
proved
that
the
real
relation
of
the
forces
had
already
made
itself
felt
in
petersburg
was
dispatched
kutuzov
had
found
himself
unable
any
longer
to
restrain
the
army
he
commanded
from
at
tacking
and
a
battle
had
taken
place
.
on
the
second
of
october
a
cossack
shapo
valov
who
was
out
scouting
killed
one
hare
and
wounded
another
.
following
the
wounded
hare
he
made
his
way
far
into
the
forest
and
came
upon
the
left
flank
of
murats
army
en
camped
there
without
any
precautions
.
the
cossack
laughingly
told
his
comrades
how
he
had
almost
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
french
.
a
cornet
hearing
the
story
informed
his
com
mander
.
the
cossack
was
sent
for
and
questioned
.
the
cossack
officers
wished
to
take
advantage
of
this
chance
to
capture
some
horses
but
one
of
the
superior
officers
who
was
acquainted
with
the
higher
authorities
reported
the
in
cident
to
a
general
on
the
staff
.
the
state
of
things
on
the
staff
had
of
late
been
exceeding
ly
strained
.
erm61ov
had
been
to
see
bennig
sen
a
few
days
previously
and
had
entreated
him
to
use
his
influence
with
the
commander
in
chief
to
induce
him
to
take
the
offensive
.
if
i
did
not
know
you
i
should
think
you
did
not
want
what
you
are
asking
for
.
i
need
only
advise
anything
and
his
highness
is
sure
to
do
the
opposite
replied
bennigsen
.
the
cossacks
report
confirmed
by
horse
patrols
who
were
sent
out
was
the
final
proof
that
events
had
matured
.
the
tightly
coiled
spring
was
released
the
clock
began
to
whirr
and
the
chimes
to
play
.
despite
all
his
sup
posed
power
his
intellect
his
experience
and
his
knowledge
of
men
kutiizov
having
taken
into
consideration
the
cossacks
report
a
note
from
bennigsen
who
sent
personal
reports
to
the
emperor
the
wishes
he
supposed
the
em
peror
to
hold
and
the
fact
that
all
the
generals
expressed
the
same
wishcould
no
longer
check
the
inevitable
movement
and
gave
the
order
to
do
what
he
regarded
as
useless
and
harmful
gave
his
approval
that
is
to
the
accomplished
fact
.
chapter
iv
bknnigsens
note
and
the
cossacks
informa
tion
that
the
left
flank
of
the
french
was
un
guarded
were
merely
final
indications
that
it
was
necessary
to
order
an
attack
and
it
was
fixed
for
the
fifth
of
october
.
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
of
october
kutuzov
signed
the
dispositions
.
toll
read
them
to
erm61ov
asking
him
to
attend
to
the
further
arrangements
.
all
right
all
right
.
i
havent
time
just
now
replied
erm61ov
and
left
the
hut
.
the
dispositions
drawn
up
by
toll
were
very
book
thirteen
good
.
as
in
the
austerlitz
dispositions
it
was
writtenthough
not
in
german
this
time
the
first
column
will
march
here
and
here
the
second
column
will
march
there
and
there
and
so
on
and
on
paper
all
these
columns
arrived
at
their
places
at
the
appointed
time
and
destroyed
the
enemy
.
everything
had
been
admirably
thought
out
as
is
usual
in
dis
positions
and
as
is
always
the
case
not
a
single
column
reached
its
place
at
the
appointed
time
.
when
the
necessary
number
of
copies
of
the
dispositions
had
been
prepared
an
officer
was
summoned
and
sent
to
deliver
them
to
ermo
lov
to
deal
with
.
a
young
officer
of
the
horse
guards
kutuzovs
orderly
pleased
at
the
im
portance
of
the
mission
entrusted
to
him
went
to
erm61ovs
quarters
.

away
said
erm61ovs
orderly
.
the
officer
of
the
horse
guards
went
to
a
general
with
whom
ermolov
was
often
to
be
found
.
no
and
the
generals
out
too
.
the
officer
mounting
his
horse
rode
off
to
someone
else
.
no
hes
gone
out
.
if
only
they
dont
make
me
responsible
for
this
delay
what
a
nuisance
it
is
thought
the
officer
and
he
rode
round
the
whole
camp
.
one
man
said
he
had
seen
erm61ov
ride
past
with
some
other
generals
others
said
he
must
have
returned
home
.
the
officer
searched
till
six
oclock
in
the
evening
without
even
stop
ping
to
eat
.
ermolov
was
nowhere
to
be
found
and
no
one
knew
where
he
was
.
the
officer
snatched
a
little
food
at
a
comrades
and
rode
again
to
the
vanguard
to
find
miloradovich
.
milorddovich
too
was
away
but
here
he
was
told
that
he
had
gone
to
a
ball
at
general
ki
kins
and
that
erm61ov
was
probably
there
too
.
but
where
is
it
why
there
over
at
echkino
said
a
cos
sack
officer
pointing
to
a
country
house
in
the
far
distance
.
what
outside
our
line
theyve
put
two
regiments
as
outposts
and
theyre
having
such
a
spree
there

the
officer
rode
out
beyond
our
lines
to
echkino
.
while
still
at
a
distance
he
heard
as
he
rode
the
merry
sounds
of
a
soldiers
dance
song
proceeding
from
the
house
.
in
the
meadows

..
.
in
the
meadows
he
heard
accompanied
by
whistling
and
the
sound
of
a
torban
drowned
every
now
and
then
by
567
shouts
.
these
sounds
made
his
spirits
rise
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
afraid
that
he
would
be
blamed
for
not
having
executed
sooner
the
important
order
entrusted
to
him
.
it
was
al
ready
past
eight
oclock
.
he
dismounted
and
went
up
into
the
porch
of
a
large
country
house
which
had
remained
intact
between
the
russian
and
french
forces
.
in
the
refreshment
room
and
the
hall
footmen
were
bustling
about
with
wine
and
viands
.
groups
of
singers
stood
outside
the
windows
.
the
officer
was
ad
mitted
and
immediately
saw
all
the
chief
gen
erals
of
the
army
together
and
among
them
ermolovs
big
imposing
figure
.
they
all
had
their
coats
unbuttoned
and
were
standing
in
a
semicircle
with
flushed
and
animated
faces
laughing
loudly
.
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
short
handsome
general
with
a
red
face
was
dancing
the
trepdk
with
much
spirit
and
agil
ity
.
ha
ha
ha
bravo
nicholas

ha
ha
ha
the
officer
felt
that
by
arriving
with
impor
tant
orders
at
such
a
moment
he
was
doubly
to
blame
and
he
would
have
preferred
to
wait
but
one
of
the
generals
espied
him
and
hear
ing
what
he
had
come
about

erm6
lov

ermolov
came
forward
with
a
frown
on
his
face
and
hearing
what
the
officer
had
to
say
took
the
papers
from
him
without
a
word
.
you
think
he
went
off
just
by
chance
said
a
comrade
who
was
on
the
staff
that
evening
to
the
officer
of
the
horse
guards
referring
to
ermolov
.
it
was
a
trick
.
it
was
done
on
pur
pose
to
get
konovnitsyn
into
trouble

youll
see
what
a
mess
therell
be
tomorrow

chapter
v
next
day
the
decrepit
kutiizov
having
given
orders
to
be
called
early
said
his
prayers
dressed
and
with
an
unpleasant
consciousness
of
having
to
direct
a
battle
he
did
not
approve
of
got
into
his
caleche
and
drove
from
leta
sh6vka
a
village
three
and
a
half
miles
from
tariitino
to
the
place
where
the
attacking
columns
were
to
meet
.
he
sat
in
the
caltche
dozing
and
waking
up
by
turns
and
listening
for
any
sound
of
firing
on
the
right
as
an
indi
cation
that
the
action
had
begun
.
but
all
was
still
quiet
.
a
damp
dull
autumn
morning
was
just
dawning
.
on
approaching
tariitino
ku
tiizov
noticed
cavalrymen
leading
their
horses
to
water
across
the
road
along
which
he
was
driving
.
kutiizov
looked
at
them
searchingly
568
stopped
his
carriage
and
inquired
what
regi
ment
they
belonged
to
.
they
belonged
to
a
column
that
should
have
been
far
in
front
and
in
ambush
long
before
then
.
it
may
be
a
mis
take
thought
the
old
commander
in
chief
.
but
a
little
further
on
he
saw
infantry
regi
ments
with
their
arms
piled
and
the
soldiers
only
partly
dressed
eating
their
rye
porridge
and
carrying
fuel
.
he
sent
for
an
officer
.
the
officer
reported
that
no
order
to
advance
had
been
received
.
how
not
rec

.

.
kutuzov
began
but
checked
himself
immediately
and
sent
for
a
senior
officer
.
getting
out
of
his
caltche
he
waited
with
drooping
head
and
breathing
heavily
pacing
silently
up
and
down
.
when
efkhen
the
officer
of
the
general
staff
whom
he
had
summoned
appeared
kutuzov
went
purple
in
the
face
not
because
that
officer
was
to
blame
for
the
mistake
but
because
he
was
an
object
of
sufficient
importance
for
him
to
vent
his
wrath
on
.
trembling
and
panting
the
old
man
fell
into
that
state
of
fury
in
which
he
sometimes
used
to
roll
on
the
ground
and
he
fell
upon
eykhen
threatening
him
with
his
hands
shouting
and
loading
him
with
gross
abuse
.
another
man
captain
br6zin
who
hap
pened
to
turn
up
and
who
was
not
at
all
to
blame
suffered
the
same
fate
.
what
sort
of
another
blackguard
are
you
ill
have
you
shot
scoundrels
yelled
kutu
zov
in
a
hoarse
voice
waving
his
arms
and
reel
ing
.
he
was
suffering
physically
.
he
the
com
mander
in

a
serene
highness
who
every
body
said
possessed
powers
such
as
no
man
had
ever
had
in

to
be
placed
in
this
posi

been
in
such
a
hurry
to
pray
about
today
or
have
kept
awake

everything
over
all

thought
he
to
himself
.
when
i
was
a
chit
of
an
officer
no
one
would
have
dared
to
mock
me
so

..
.
and
now
he
was
in
a
state
of
physical
suffering
as
if
from
corporal
punishment
and
could
not
avoid
expressing
it
by
cries
of
anger
and
dis
tress
.
but
his
strength
soon
began
to
fail
him
and
looking
about
him
conscious
of
having
said
much
that
was
amiss
he
again
got
into
his
caliche
and
drove
back
in
silence
.
his
wrath
once
expended
did
not
return
and
blinking
feebly
he
listened
to
excuses
and
selfjustifications
erm61ov
did
not
come
to
see
him
till
the
next
day
and
to
the
insistence
of
bennigsen
konovnitsyn
and
toll
that
the
movement
that
had
miscarried
should
be
exe

and
peace
cuted
next

and
once
more
kutiizov
had
to
consent

chapter

next
day
the
troops
assembled
in
their
ap
pointed
places
in
the
evening
and
advanced
during
the
night
.
it
was
an
autumn
night
with
dark
purple
clouds
but
no
rain
.
the
ground
was
damp
but

and
the
troops
ad
vanced
noiselessly
only
occasionally
a
jingling
of
the
artillery
could
be
faintly
heard
.
the
men
were
forbidden
to
talk
out
loud
to
smoke
their
pipes
or
to
strike
a
light
and
they
tried
to
prevent
their
horses
neighing
.
the
secrecy
of
the
undertaking
heightened
its
charm
and
they
marched
gaily
.
some
columns
supposing
they
had
reached
their
destination
halted
piled
arms
and
settled
down
on
the
cold
ground
but
the
majority
marched
all
night
and
arrived
at
places
where
they
evidently
should
not
have
been
.
only
count
orlovdenisov
with
his
cos
sacks
the
least
important
detachment
of
all
got
to
his
appointed
place
at
the
right
time
.
this
detachment
halted
at
the
outskirts
of
a
forest
on
the
path
leading
from
the
village
of
stromilova
to
dmftrovsk
.
toward
dawn
count
orlovdenfsov
who
had
dozed
off
was
awakened
by
a
deserter
from
the
french
army
being
brought
to
him
.
this
was
a
polish
sergeant
of
poniatowskis
corps
who
explained
in
polish
that
he
had
come
over
because
he
had
been
slighted
in
the
serv
ice
that
he
ought
long
ago
to
have
been
made
an
officer
that
he
was
braver
than
any
of
them
and
so
he
had
left
them
and
wished
to
pay
them
out
.
he
said
that
murat
was
spending
the
night
less
than
a
mile
from
where
they
were
and
that
if
they
would
let
him
have
a
convoy
of
a
hundred
men
he
would
capture
him
alive
.
count
orl6vdenfsov
consulted
his
fellow
officers
.
the
offer
was
too
tempting
to
be
refused
.
everyone
volunteered
to
go
and
everybody
ad
vised
making
the
attempt
.
after
much
disput
ing
and
arguing
majorgeneral
grkov
with
two
cossack
regiments
decided
to
go
with
the
polish
sergeant
.
now
remember
said
count
orl6vdenf
sov
to
the
sergeant
at
parting
if
you
have
been
lying
ill
have
you
hanged
like
a
dog
but
if
its
true
you
shall
have
a
hundred
gold
pieces
without
replying
the
sergeant
with
a
reso
lute
air
mounted
and
rode
away
with
grkov
whose
men
had
quickly
assembled
.
they
dis
book

appeared
into
the
forest
and
count
orl6v
denfsov
having
seen
grkov
off
returned
shivering
from
the
freshness
of
the
early
dawn
and
excited
by
what
he
had
undertaken
on
his
own
responsibility
and
began
looking
at
the
enemy
camp
now
just
visible
in
the
deceptive
light
of
dawn
and
the
dying
campfires
.
our
columns
ought
to
have
begun
to
appear
on
an
open
declivity
to
his
right
.
he
looked
in
that
direction
but
though
the
columns
would
have
been
visible
quite
far
off
they
were
not
to
be
seen
.
it
seemed
to
the
count
that
things
were
beginning
to
stir
in
the
french
camp
and
his
keensighted
adjutant
confirmed
this
.
oh
it
is
really
too
late
said
count
orl6v
looking
at
the
camp
.
as
often
happens
when
someone
we
have
trusted
is
no
longer
before
our
eyes
it
sudden
ly
seemed
quite
clear
and
obvious
to
him
that
the
sergeant
was
an
impostor
that
he
had
lied
and
that
the
whole
russian
attack
would
be
ruined
by
the
absence
of
those
two
regiments
which
he
would
lead
away
heaven
only
knew
where
.
how
could
one
capture
a
commander
in
chief
from
among
such
a
mass
of
troops
i
am
sure
that
rascal
was
lying
said
the
count
.
they
can
still
be
called
back
said
one
of
his
suite
who
like
count
orlov
felt
distrustful
of
the
adventure
when
he
looked
at
the
en
emys
camp
.
eh
really

.

.

.
what
do
you
think
should
we
let
them
go
on
or
not
will
you
have
them
fetched

said
count
orlov
with
sudden
determination
look
ing
at
his
watch
.
it
will
be
too
late
.
it
is
quite
light
.
and
the
adjutant
galloped
through
the
forest
after
grkov
.
when
grkov
returned
count
orl6vdenfsov
excited
both
by
the
abandoned
attempt
and
by
vainly
awaiting
the
infantry
columns
that
still
did
not
appear
as
well
as
by
the
proximity
of
the
enemy
resolved
to
advance
.
all
his
men

the
same

it

none

listened

fifteen

taken
on

important
to
the

meanwhile
another
column
was
to
have
at
tacked
the
french
from
the
front
but
kutu
zov
accompanied
that
column
.
he
well
knew
that
nothing
but
confusion
would
come
of
this
battle
undertaken
against
his
will
and
as
far
as
was
in
his
power
held
the
troops
back
.
he
did
not
advance
.
he
rode
silently
on
his
small
gray
horse
in
dolently
answering
suggestions
that
they
should
attack
.
the
word
attack
is
always
on
your
tongue
but
you
dont
see
that
we
are
unable
to
execute
complicated
maneuvers
said
he
to
milora
dovich
who
asked
permission
to
advance
.
we
couldnt
take
murat
prisoner
this
morn
ing
or
get
to
the
place
in
time
and
nothing
can
be
done
now
he
replied
to
someone
else
.
when
kutuzov
was
informed
that
at
the
french
rear
where
according
to
the
reports
of
the
cossacks
there
had
previously
been
no
bodythere
were
now
two
battalions
of
poles
he
gave
a
sidelong
glance
at
erm61ov
who
was
behind
him
and
to
whom
he
had
not
spoken
since
the
previous
day
.
you
see
they
are
asking
to
attack
and
mak
ing
plans
of
all
kinds
but
as
soon
as
one
gets
to
business
nothing
is
ready
and
the
enemy
forewarned
takes
measures
accordingly
.
erm61ov
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
smiled
faintly
on
hearing
these
words
.
he
understood
that
for
him
the
storm
had
blown
over
and
that
kutuzov
would
content
himself
with
that
hint
.

after

kutuzov
did
not
reply
but
when
they
re
ported
to
him
that
murats
troops
were
in
re
treat
he
ordered
an
advance
though
at
every
hundred
paces
he
halted
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
.
the
whole
battle
consisted
in
what
orl6v

had
done
the
rest
of
the

merely
lost
some
hundreds

in

fresh

were

in

.
thats
how
everything
is
done

said
the
russian
officers
and
gen
erals
after
the
tarutino
battle
letting
it
be
understood
that
some
fool
there
is
doing
things
all
wrong
but
that
we
ourselves
should
not
have
done
so
just
as
people
speak
today

takes

as
those

that
is
an
essential

a

than
during

it
is
a

influence
the
course
taken
by
the

that
course
nev
er
can
be
known
in

with

if

rected
forces
act
on
a
given
body
the
direction
of
its
motion
cannot
coincide
with
any
one
of
those
forces
but
will
always
be
a
mean
what
in
mechanics
is
represented
by
the
diagonal
of
a
parallelogram
of
forces
.
if
in
the
descriptions
given
by
historians
especially
french
ones
we
find
their
wars
and
battles
carried
out
in
accordance
with
previ
ously
formed
plans
the
only
conclusion
to
be
drawn
is
that
those
descriptions
are
false
.
the
battle
of
tariitino
obviously
did
not
attain
the
aim
toll
had
in
view
to
lead
the
troops
into
action
in
the
order
prescribed
by
the
dispositions
nor
that
which
count
orl6v
denisov
may
have
had
in
view
to
take
murat
prisoner
nor
the
result
of
immediately
de
book

stroying
the
whole
corps
which
bennigsen
and
others
may
have
had
in
view
nor
the
aim
of
the
officer
who
wished
to
go
into
action
to
dis
tinguish
himself
nor
that
of
the
cossack
who
wanted
more
booty
than
he
got
and
so
on
.
but
if
the
aim
of
the
battle
was
what
actually
re
sulted
and
what
all
the
russians
of
that
day
desired
to
drive
the
french
out
of
russia
and
destroy
their
army
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
battle
of
tanitino
just
because
of
its
incon
gruities
was
exactly
what
was
wanted
at
that
stage
of
the
campaign
.
it
would
be
difficult
and
even
impossible
to
imagine
any
result
more
opportune
than
the
actual
outcome
of
this
bat
tle
.
with
a
minimum
of
effort
and
insignifi
cant
losses
despite
the
greatest
confusion
the
most
important
results
of
the
whole
campaign
were
attained
the
transition
from
retreat
to
advance
an
exposure
of
the
weakness
of
the
frdnch
and
the
administration
of
that
shock
which
napoleons
army
had
only
awaited
to
begin
its
flight

to

the

at

for
that
only
very
simple
and
easy

were
necessary
not
to
allow
the

to

to
prepare

there
was

there

had
napoleons
aim

to
destroy

the

com
pletely
have
accomplished

anything
the

might
do

napoleon
the
man
of
genius
did
this
but
to
say
that
he
destroyed
his
army
because
he
wished
to
or
because
he
was
very
stupid
would
be
as
unjust
as
to
say
that
he
had
brought
his
troops
to
moscow
because
he
wished
to
and
be
cause
he
was
very
clever
and
a
genius
.
in
both
cases
his
personal
activity
having
no
more
force
than
the
personal
activity
of
any
soldier
merely
coincided
with
the
laws
that
guided
the
event
.
the
historians
quite
falsely
represent
na
poleons
faculties
as
having
weakened
in
mos
cow
and
do
so
only
because
the
results
did
not
justify
his
actions
.
he
employed
all
his
ability
and
strength
to
do
the
best
he
could
for
himself
and
his
army
as
he
had
done
previous
ly
and
as
he
did
subsequently
in
1813
.
his
ac
tivity
at
that
time
was
no
less
astounding
than
it
was
in
egypt
in
italy
in
austria
and
in
prussia
.
we
do
not
know
for
certain
in
how
far
his
genius
was
genuine
in
egypt
where
forty
centuries
looked
down
upon
his
grandeur
for
his
great
exploits
there
are
all
told
us
by
frenchmen
.
we
cannot
accurately
estimate
his
genius
in
austria
or
prussia
for
we
have
to
draw
our
information
from
french
or
german
sources
and
the
incomprehensible
surrender
of
whole
corps
without
fighting
and
of
for
tresses
without
a
siege
must
incline
germans
to
recognize
his
genius
as
the
only
explanation
of
the
war
carried
on
in
germany
.
but
we
thank
god
kave
no
need
to
recognize
his
gen

and
peace
ius
in
order
to
hide
our
shame
.
we
have
paid
for
the
right
to
look
at
the
matter
plainly
and
simply
and
we
will
not
abandon
that
right
.
his
activity
in

was
as
amazing
and
as
full
of

as

the

pillaging
continue
.
there
is
a
band
of
thieves
in
our
district
who
ought
to
be
arrested
by
a
strong
force

.
the
emperor
is
extremely
displeased
that
despite
the
strict
orders
to
stop
pillage
parties
of
marauding
guards
are
continually
seen
re
turning
to
the
kremlin
.
among
the
old
guard
disorder
and
pillage
were
renewed
more
vio
lently
than
ever
yesterday
evening
last
night
and
today
.
the
emperor
sees
with
regret
that
the
picked
soldiers
appointed
to
guard
his
per
son
who
should
set
an
example
of
discipline
carry
disobedience
to
such
a
point
that
they
break
into
the
cellars
and
stores
containing
army
supplies
.
others
have
disgraced
them
selves
to
the
extent
of
disobeying
sentinels
and
officers
and
have
abused
and
beaten
them
.
the
grand
marshal
of
the
palace
wrote
the
governor
complains
bitterly
that
in
spite
of
repeated
orders
the
soldiers
continue
to
commit
nuisances
in
all
the
courtyards
and
even
under
the
very
windows
of
the
emperor
.
that
army
like
a
herd
of
cattle
run
wild
and
trampling
underfoot
the
provender
which
might
have
saved
it
from
starvation
disinte
grated
and
perished
with
each
additional
day
it
remained
in
moscow
.
but
it
did
not
go
away
.
it
began
to
run
away
only
when
suddenly
seized
by
a
panic
caused
by
the
capture
of
trans
port
trains
on
the
smolensk
road
and
by
the
battle
of
tanitino
.
the
news
of
that
battle
of
tarutino
unexpectedly
received
by
napoleon
at
a
review
evoked
in
him
a
desire
to
punish
the
russians
thiers
says
and
he
issued
the
order
for
departure
which
the
whole
army
was
demanding
.
fleeing
from
moscow
the
soldiers
took
with
them
everything
they
had
stolen
.
napoleon
too
carried
away
his
own
personal
trdsor
but
on
seeing
the
baggage
trains
that
impeded
the
army
he
was
thiers
says
horrorstruck
.
and
yet
with
his
experience
of
war
he
did
not
order
all
the
superfluous
vehicles
to
be
burned
as
he
had
done
with
those
of
a
certain
marshal
when
approaching
moscow
.
he
gazed
at
the
caliches
and
carriages
in
which
soldiers
were
riding
and
book
thirteen
remarked
that
it
was
a
very
good
thing
as
those
vehicles
could
be
used
to
carry
provisions
the
sick
and
the
wounded
.
the
plight
of
the
whole
army
resembled
that
of
a
wounded
animal
which
feels
it
is
per
ishing
and
does
not
know
what
it
is
doing
.
to
study
the
skillful
tactics
and
aims
of
napoleon
and
his
army
from
the
time
it
entered
moscow
till
it
was
destroyed
is
like
studying
the
dying
leaps
and
shudders
of
a
mortally
wounded
ani
mal
.
very
often
a
wounded
animal
hearing
a
rustle
rushes
straight
at
the
hunters
gun
runs
forward
and
back
again
and
hastens
its
own
end
.
napoleon
under
pressure
from
his
whole
army
did
the
same
thing
.
the
rustle
of
the
battle
of
tarutino
frightened
the
beast
and
it
rushed
forward
onto
the
hunters
gun
reached
him
turned
back
and
finally
like
any
wild
beast
ran
back
along
the
most
disadvanta
geous
and
dangerous
path
where
the
old
scent
was
familiar
.
during
the
whole
of
that
period
napoleon
who
seems
to
us
to
have
been
the
leader
of
all
these
movements
as
the
figurehead
of
a
ship
may
seem
to
a
savage
to
guide
the
vessel
acted
like
a
child
who
holding
a
couple
of
strings
inside
a
carriage
thinks
he
is
driving
it
.

chapter
xi
early
in
the
morning
of
the
sixth
of
october
pierre
went
out
of
the
shed
and
on
returning
stopped
by
the
door
to
play
with
a
little
blue
gray
dog
with
a
long
body
and
short
bandy
legs
that
jumped
about
him
.
this
little
dog
lived
in
their
shed
sleeping
beside
karatacv
at
night
it
sometimes
made
excursions
into
the
town
but
always
returned
again
.
probably
it
had
never
had
an
owner
and
it
still
belonged
to
nobody
and
had
no
name
.
the
french
called
it
azor
the
soldier
who
told
stories
called
it
femgalka
karataev
and
others
called
it
gray
or
sometimes
flabby
.
its
lack
of
a
master
a
name
or
even
of
a
breed
or
any
definite
color
did
not
seem
to
trouble
the
bluegray
dog
in
the
least
.
its
furry
tail
stood
up
firm
and
round
as
a
plume
its
bandy
legs
served
it
so
well
that
it
would
often
gracefully
lift
a
hind
leg
and
run
very
easily
and
quickly
on
three
legs
as
if
disdaining
to
use
all
four
.
everything
pleased
it
.
now
it
would
roll
on
its
back
yelping
with
delight
now
bask
in
the
sun
with
a
thoughtful
air
of
importance
and
now
frolic
about
play
ing
with
a
chip
of
wood
or
a
straw
.
pierres
attire
by
now
consisted
of
a
dirty
torn
shirt
the
only
remnant
of
his
former
clothing
a
pair
of
soldiers
trousers
which
by
karatdevs
advice
he
tied
with
string
round
the
ankles
for
warmth
and
a
peasant
coat
and
cap
.
physically
he
had
changed
much
during
this
time
.
he
no
longer
seemed
stout
though
he
still
had
the
appearanccof
solidityandstrength
hereditary
in
his
family
.
a
beard
and
mustache
covered
the
lower
part
of
his
face
and
a
tangle
of
hair
infested
with
lice
curled
round
his
head
like
a
cap
.
the
look
of
his
eyes
was
resolute
calm
and
animatedly
alert
as
never
before
.
the
former
slackness
which
had
shown
itself
even
in
his
eyes
was
now
replaced
by
an
ener
getic
readiness
for
action
and
resistance
.
his
feet
were
bare
.
pierre
first
looked
down
the
field
across
which
vehicles
and
horsemen
were
passing
that
morning
then
into
the
distance
across
the
riv
er
then
at
the
dog
who
was
pretending
to
be
in
earnest
about
biting
him
and
then
at
his
bare
feet
which
he
placed
with
pleasure
in
vari
ous
positions
moving
his
dirty
thick
big
toes
.
every
time
he
looked
at
his
bare
feet
a
smile
of
animated
selfsatisfaction
flitted
across
his
face
.
the
sight
of
them
reminded
him
of
all
he
had
experienced
and
learned
during
these
weeks
and
this
recollection
was
pleasant
to
him
.
for
some
days
the
weather
had
been
calm
and
clear
with
slight
frosts
in
the
mornings
what
is
called
an
old
wives
summer
.
in
the
sunshine
the
air
was
warm
and
that
warmth
was
particularly
pleasant
with
the
in
vigorating
freshness
of
the
morning
frost
still
in
the
air
.
on
everything
far
and
near
lay
the
magic
crystal
glitter
seen
only
at
that
tinieof
autumn
.
the
sparrow
hills
were
visible
in
the
distance
with
the
village
the
church
and
the
large
white
house
.
the
bare
trees
the
sand
the
bricks
and
roofs
of
the
houses
the
green
church
spire
and
the
corners
of
the
white
house
in
the
distance
all
stood
out
in
the
transparent
air
in
most
delicate
outline
and
with
unnatural
clearness
.
near
by
could
be
seen
the
familiar
ruins
of
a
halfburned
mansion
occupied
by
the
french
with
lilac
bushes
still
showing
dark
green
be
side
the
fence
.
and
even
that
ruined
and
be
fouled
house
which
in
dull
weather
was
re
pulsively
ugly
seemed
quietly
beautiful
now
in
the
clear
motionless
brilliance
.
a
french
corporal
with
coat
unbuttoned
in
a
homely
way
a
skullcap
on
his
head
and
a
short
pipe
in
his
mouth
came
from
behind
a
corner
of
the
shed
and
approached
pierre
with
a
friendly
wink
.
what
sunshine
monsieur
kiril
their
576
name
for
pierre
.
eh
just
like
springl
and
the
corporal
leaned
against
the
door
and
offered
pierre
his
pipe
though
whenever
he
offered
it
pierre
always
declined
it
.
to
be
on
the
march
in
such
weather

.

.

.
he
began
.
pierre
inquired
what
was
being
said
about
leaving
and
the
corporal
told
him
that
nearly
all
the
troops
were
starting
and
there
ought
to
be
an
order
about
the
prisoners
that
day
.
soko
lov
one
of
the
soldiers
in
the
shed
with
pierre
was
dying
and
pierre
told
the
corporal
that
something
should
be
done
about
him
.
the
corporal
replied
that
pierre
need
not
worry
about
that
as
they
had
an
ambulance
and
a
permanent
hospital
and
arrangements
would
be
made
for
the
sick
and
that
in
general
every
thing
that
could
happen
had
been
foreseen
by
the
authorities
.
besides
monsieur
kiril
you
have
only
to
say
a
word
to
the
captain
you
know
.
he
is
a
man
who
never
forgets
anything
.
speak
to
the
captain
when
he
makes
his
round
he
will
do
anything
for
you
.
the
captain
of
whom
the
corporal
spoke
often
had
long
chats
with
pierre
and
showed
him
all
sorts
of
favors
.

you
see
st
.
thomas
he
said
to
me
the
other
day
.
monsieur
kiril
is
a
man
of
educa
tion
who
speaks
french
.
he
is
a
russian
sei
gneur
who
has
had
misfortunes
but
he
is
a
man
.
he
knows
whats
what
.

..
.
if
he
wants
any
thing
and
asks
me
he
wont
get
a
refusal
.
when
one
has
studied
you
see
one
likes
education
and
wellbred
people
.
it
is
for
your
sake
i
mention
it
monsieur
kiril
.
the
other
day
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
that
affair
would
have
ended
ill
.
and
after
chatting
a
while
longer
the
cor
poral
went
away
.
the
affair
he
had
alluded
to
had
happened
a
few
days
beforea
fight
be
tween
the
prisoners
and
the
french
soldiers
in
which
pierre
had
succeeded
in
pacifying
his
comrades
.
some
of
the
prisoners
who
had
heard
pierre
talking
to
the
corporal
immedi
ately
asked
what
the
frenchman
had
said
.
while
pierre
was
repeating
what
he
had
been
told
about
the
army
leaving
moscow
a
thin
sallow
tattered
french
soldier
came
up
to
the
door
of
the
shed
.
rapidly
and
timidly
raising
his
fin
gers
to
his
forehead
by
way
of
greeting
he
asked
pierre
whether
the
soldier
platoche
to
whom
he
had
given
a
shirt
to
sew
was
in
that
shed
.
a
week
before
the
french
had
had
boot
leather
and
linen
issued
to
them
which
they
war
and
peace
had
given
out
to
the
prisoners
to
make
up
into
boots
and
shirts
for
them
.
ready
ready
dear
fellow
said
karatdev
coming
out
with
a
neatly
folded
shirt
.
karatdev
on
account
of
the
warm
weather
and
for
convenience
at
work
was
wearing
only
trousers
and
a
tattered
shirt
as
black
as
soot
.
his
hair
was
bound
round
workman
fashion
with
a
wisp
of
limetree
bast
and
his
round
face
seemed
rounder
and
pleasanter
than
ever
.
a
promise
is
own
brother
to
performance
i
said
friday
and
here
it
is
ready
said
plat6n
smiling
and
unfolding
the
shirt
he
had
sewn
.
the
frenchman
glanced
around
uneasily
and
then
as
if
overcoming
his
hesitation
rapid
ly
threw
off
his
uniform
and
put
on
the
shirt
.
he
had
a
long
greasy
flowered
silk
waistcoat
next
to
his
sallow
thin
bare
body
but
no
shirt
.
he
was
evidently
afraid
the
prisoners
looking
on
would
laugh
at
him
and
thrust
his
head
into
the
shirt
hurriedly
.
none
of
the
prisoners
said
a
word
.
see
it
fits
well
plat6n
kept
repeating
pulling
the
shirt
straight
.
the
frenchman
having
pushed
his
head
and
hands
through
without
raising
his
eyes
looked
down
at
the
shirt
and
examined
the
seams
.
you
see
dear
man
this
is
not
a
sewing
shop
and
i
had
no
proper
tools
and
as
they
say
one
needs
a
tool
even
to
kill
a
louse
said
plat6n
with
one
of
his
round
smiles
obviously
pleased
with
his
work
.
its
good
quite
good
thank
you
said
the
frenchman
in
french
but
there
must
be
some
linen
left
over
.
it
will
fit
better
still
when
it
sets
to
your
body
said
karatdev
still
admiring
his
handi
work
.
youll
be
nice
and
comfortable
.

.

.

.
thanks
thanks
old
fellow
but
the
bits
left
over
said
the
frenchman
again
and
smiled
.
he
took
out
an
assignation
ruble
note
and
gave
it
to
karatdev
.
but
give
me
the
pieces
that
are
over
.
pierre
saw
that
plat6n
did
not
want
to
un
derstand
what
the
frenchman
was
saying
and
he
looked
on
without
interfering
.
karatdev
thanked
the
frenchman
for
the
money
and
went
on
admiring
his
own
work
.
the
french
man
insisted
on
having
the
pieces
returned
that
were
left
over
and
asked
pierre
to
trans
late
what
he
said
.
what
does
he
want
the
bits
for
said
kara
tdev
.
theyd
make
fine
leg
bands
for
us
.
well
never
mind
.
and
karatdev
with
a
suddenly
changed
and
book
thirteen
saddened
expression
took
a
small
bundle
of
scraps
from
inside
his
shirt
and
gave
it
to
the
frenchman
without
looking
at
him
.
oh
dear

muttered
karataev
and
went
away
.
the
french
man
looked
at
the
linen
considered
for
a
mo
ment
then
looked
inquiringly
at
pierre
and
as
if
pierres
look
had
told
him
something
sud
denly
blushed
and
shouted
in
a
squeaky
voice
platoche
eh
platochel

them

self

and
handing
back
the
odd
bits
he
turned
and
went
out
.
there

at

swaying
his
head

karataev
smiled
thoughtfully
and
was
silent
awhile
looking
at
the
pieces

he
said
and
went
back
into
the

four
weeks
had
passed
since
pierre
had
been
taken

had

fered
to

in

and
devastated
moscow
pierre
experienced
almost
the
extreme
limits
of
pri
vation
a
man
can
endure
but
thanks
to
his
physical
strength
and
health
of
which
he
had
till
then
been
unconscious
and
thanks
especial
ly
to
the
fact
that
the
privations
came
so
gradually
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
when
they
began
he
endured
his
position
not
only
lightly
but
joyfully
.
and
just
at
this
time
he
obtained
the
tranquillity
and
ease
of
mind
he
had
formerly
striven
in
vain
to
reach
.
he
had
long
sought
in
different
ways
that
tranquillity
of
mind
that
inner
harmony
which
had
so
im
pressed
him
in
the
soldiers
at
the
battle
of
bo
rodino
.
he
had
sought
it
in
philanthropy
in
freemasonry
in
the
dissipations
of
town
life
in
wine
in
heroic
feats
of
selfsacrifice
and
in
romantic
love
for
natdsha
he
had
sought
it
by
reasoning
and
all
these
quests
and
experi
ments
had
failed
him
.
and
now
without
think
ing
about
it
he
had
found
that
peace
and
in
ner
harmony
only
through
the
horror
of
death
through
privation
and
through
what
he
rec
ognized
in
karatdev
.
those
dreadful
moments
he
had
lived
through
at
the
executions
had
as
it
were
for
ever
washed
away
from
his
imagination
and
memory
the
agitating
thoughts
and
feelings
that
had
formerly
seemed
so
important
.
it
did
not
now
occur
to
him
to
think
of
russia
or
the
war
or
politics
or
napoleon
.
it
was
plain
to
him
that
all
these
things
were
no
business
of
his
and
that
he
was
not
called
on
to
judge
con
cerning
them
and
therefore
could
not
do
so
.

thought
repeating
words
of

which
he
found
strangely
consoling

his
intention
of
killing
napoleon
and
his
cal
culations
of
the
cabalistic
number
of
the
beast
of
the
apocalypse
now
seemed
to
him
mean
ingless
and
even
ridiculous
.
his
anger
with
his
wife
and
anxiety
that
his
name
should
not
be
smirched
now
seemed
not
merely
trivial
but
even
amusing

he
now
often
remembered
his
conversation
with
prince
andrew
and
quite
agreed
with
him
though
he
understood
prince
andrews
thoughts
somewhat
differently
.
prince
andrew
had
thought
and
said
that
happiness
could
on
ly
be
negative
but
had
said
it
with
a
shade
of
bitterness
and
irony
as
though
he
was
really
saying
that
all
desire
for
positive
happiness
is
implanted
in
us
merely
to
torment
us
and
nev
er
be
satisfied
.
but

believed
it
without
any
mental
reservation

that

to

the

that

now
that
that

was

seemed
to
him
such
an
easy

such

is
just
what

possibility

all
pierres
daydreams
now
turned
on
the
time
when
he
would
be
free
.
yet
subsequently
and
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
thought
and
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
that
month
of
cap
tivity
of
those
irrecoverable
strong
joyful
sensations
and
chiefly
of
the
complete
peace
of
mind
and
inner
freedom
which
he
experi
enced
only
during
those
weeks
.
when
on
the
first
day
he
got
up
early
went
out
of
the
shed
at
dawn
and
saw
the
cupolas
and
crosses
of
the
new
convent
of
the
virgin
still
dark
at
first
the
hoarfrost
on
the
dusty
grass
the
sparrow
hills
and
the
wooded
banks
above
the
winding
river
vanishing
in
the
pur
ple
distance
when
he
felt
the
contact
of
the
fresh
air
and
heard
the
noise
of
the
crows
fly
ing
from
moscow
across
the
field
and
when
afterwards
light
gleamed
from
the
east
and
the
suns
rim
appeared
solemnly
from
behind
a
cloud
and
the
cupolas
and
crosses
the
hoar
frost
the
distance
and
the
river
all
began
to
sparkle
in
the
glad
light
pierre
felt
a
new
joy
and
strength
in
life
such
as
he
had
never
be
fore
known
.
and
this
not
only
stayed
with
him
during
the
whole
of
his
imprisonment
but
even
grew
in
strength
as
the
hardships
of
his
position
increased
.
that
feeling
of
alertness
and
of
readiness
for
anything
was
still
further
strengthened
in
him
by
the
high
opinion
his
fellow
prisoners
formed
of
him
soon
after
his
arrival
at
the
shed
.
with
his
knowledge
of
languages
the
respect
shown
him
by
the
french
his
simplicity
his
readiness
to
give
anything
asked
of
him
he
received
the
allowance
of
three
rubles
a
week
made
to
of
ficers
with
his
strength
which
he
showed
to
the
soldiers
by
pressing
nails
into
the
walls
of
the
hut
his
gentleness
to
his
companions
and
his
capacity
for
sitting
still
and
thinking
with
out
doing
anything
which
seemed
to
them
in
comprehensible
he
appeared
to
them
a
rather
mysterious
and
superior
being
.
the
very
quali
ties
that
had
been
a
hindrance
if
not
actually
harmful
to
him
in
the
world
he
had
lived
in
his
strength
his
disdain
for
the
comforts
of
life
his
absentmindedness
and
simplicity
here
among
these
people
gave
him
almost
the
status
of
a
hero
.
and
pierre
felt
that
their
opin
ion
placed
responsibilities
upon
him

just
as

reached
the
door
the
corporal
who
had
offered
him
a
pipe
the
day
before
came
up
to
it
with
two
soldiers
.
the
corporal
and
soldiers
were
in

with
knap

and

that
had

changed

began

but
even
as
he
spoke
he
began
to
doubt
whether
this
was
the
corporal
he
knew
or
a
stranger
so
unlike
himself
did
the
corporal
seem
at
that
moment
.
moreover
just
as
pierre
was
speaking
a
sharp
rattle
of
drums
was
sud
denly
heard
from
both
sides
.
the
corporal
frowned
at
pierres
wdrds
and
uttering
some
meaningless
oaths
slammed
the
door
.
the
shed
became
semidark
and
the
sharp
rattle
of
the
drums
on
two
sides
drowned
the
sick

the
sound
of
his
voice
in
the
stirring
and
deaf
ening
noise
of
the
drums
he
recognized
that
mysterious
callous
force
which
compelled
peo
ple
against

will
to
kill
their
fellow
men
that
force
the

which

knew

one
had
to
wait

he
did
not
again
go
to
the
sick
man
nor
turn
to
look
at
him
but
stood
frown
ing
by
the
door
of
the
hut
.
when
that
door
was
opened
and
the
pris

crowding
against

rattled
the

and
pierre
understood
that
this
mysteri
ous
force
completely
controlled
these
men
and
that
it
was
now
useless
to
say
any
more
.
the
officer
prisoners
were
separated
from
the
soldiers
and
told
to
march
in
front
.
there
were
about
thirty
officers
with
pierre
among
them
and
about
three
hundred
men
.
the
officers
who
had
come
from
the
other
sheds
were
all
strangers
to
pierre
and
much
better
dressed
than
he
.
they
looked
at
him
and
at
his
shoes
mistrustfully
as
at
an
alien
.
not
far
from
him
walked
a
fat
major
with
a
sal
low
bloated
angry
face
who
was
wear
ing
a
ka
zan
dressing
grown
tied
round
with
a
towel
and
who
evidently
enjoyed
the
respect
of
his
fellow
prisoners
.
he
kept
one
hand
in
which
he
clasped
his
tobacco
pouch
inside
the
bosom
of
his
dressing
gown
and
held
the
stem
of
his
pipe
firmly
with
the
other

the
major
grumbled
and
growled
at
everybody
because
hp
thought
he
was
being
pushed
and
that
they
were
all
hurrying
when
they
had
no
where
to
hurry
to
and
were
all
surprised
at
something
when
there
was
nothing
to
be
sur
prised
at
.
another
a
thin
little
officer
was
speaking
to
everyone
conjecturing
where
they
were
now
being
taken
and
how
far
they
would
get
that
day
.
an
official
in
felt
boots
and
wear
ing
a
commissariat
uniform
ran
round
from
side
to
side
and
gazed
at
the
ruins
of
moscow
loudly
announcing
his
observations
as
to
what
had
been
burned
down
and
what
this
or
that
part
of
the
city
was
that
they
could
see
.
a
third
officer
who
by
his
accent
was
a
pole
disputed
with
the
commissariat
officer
arguing
that
he
was
mistaken
in
his
identification
of
the
differ
ent
wards
of
moscow
.
what
are
you
disputing
about
said
the
major
angrily

what
does
it
matter
whether
it
is

you
see
its
burned
down

he
turning
to
a
man
behind
him
who
was
not
pushing
him
at
all
.
oh
oh
oh
what
have
they
done
the
prisoners
on
one
side
and
another
were
heard
saying
as
they
gazed
on

charred
ruins

all
beyond

whats

the

.
as
they
passed
near
a
church
in
the
kham6v
niki
one
of
the
few
unburned
quarters
of
moscow
the
whole
mass
of
prisoners
suddenly
started
to
one
side
and
exclamations
of
horror
and
disgust
were
heard
.
ah
the
villains
what
heathens
yes
dead
dead
so
he
is

and
smeared
with
some
thing
pierre
too
drew
near
the
church
where
the
thing
was
that
evoked
these
exclamations
and
dimly
made
out
something
leaning
against
the
palings
surrounding
the
church
.
from
the
words
of
his
comrades
who
saw
better
than
he
did
he
found
that
this
was
the
body
of
a
man
set
upright
against
the
palings
with
its
face
smeared
with
soot

the
convoy
guards
began
cursing
and
the
french
soldiers
with
fresh
virulence
drove
away
with
their
swords
the
crowd
of
prisoners
who
were
gazing
at
the
dead

the

that

.
russian
wenches
by
heaven
so
they
are
in
carriages
see
how
comfortably
theyve
settled
them
selves
again
as
at
the
church
in
kham6vniki
a
wave
of
general
curiosity
bore
all
the
prisoners
forward
onto
the
road
and
pierre
thanks
to
his
stature
saw
over
the
heads
of
the
others
what
so
attracted
their
curiosity
.
in
three
car
riages
involved
among
the
munition
carts
close
ly
squeezed
together
sat
women
with
rouged
faces
dressed
in
glaring
colors
who
were
shout
ing
something
in
shrill
voices
.
from
the
moment
pierre
had
recognized
the
appcaranceof
themysterious
force
nothing
had
seemed
to
him
strange
or
dreadful
neither
the
corpse
smeared
with
soot
for
fun
nor
these
women
hurrying
away
nor
the
burned
ruihs
of
moscow
.
all
that
he
now
witnessed
scarcely
made
an
impression
on
him
as
if
his
soul
making
ready
for
a
hard
struggle
refused
to
re
ceive
impressions
that
might
weaken
it
.
the
womens
vehicles
drove
by
.
behind
them
came
more
carts
soldiers
wagons
soldiers
gun
carriages
carriages
soldiers
ammunition
carts
more
soldiers
and
now
and
then
women
pierre
did
not
see
the
people
as
individuals
but
saw
their
movement
.
all
these
people
and
horses
seemed
driven
forward
by
some
invisible
power
.
during
the
hour
pierre
watched
them
they
all
came
flow
ing
from
the
different
streets
with
one
and
the
same
desire
to
get
on
quickly
they
all
jostled
one
another
began
to
grow
angry
and
to
fight
white
teeth
gleamed
brows
frowned
ever
the
same
words
of
abuse
flew
from
side
to
side
and
all
the
faces
bore
the
same
swaggeringly
reso
lute
and
coldly
cruel
expression
that
had
struck
pierre
thatmorningon
the
corporals
face
when
the
drums
were
beating
.
it
was
not
till
nearly
evening
that
the
officer
commanding
the
escort
collected
his
men
and
book
thirteen
581
with
shouts
and
quarrels
forced
his
way
in
among
the
baggage
trains
and
the
prisoners
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
emerged
onto
the
ka
luga
road
.
they
marched
very
quickly
without
resting
and
halted
only
when
the
sun
began
to
set
.
the
baggage
carts
drew
up
close
together
and
the
men
began
to
prepare
for
their
nights
rest
.
they
all
appeared
angry
and
dissatisfied
.
for
a
long
time
oaths
angry
shouts
and
fighting
could
be
heard
from
all
sides
.
a
carriage
that
followed
the
escort
ran
into
one
of
the
carts
and
knocked
a
hole
in
it
with
its
pole
.
several
soldiers
ran
toward
the
cart
from
different
sides
some
beat
the
carriage
horses
on
their
heads
turning
them
aside
others
fought
among
themselves
and
pierre
saw
that
one
german
was
badly
wounded
on
the
head
by
a
sword
.
it
seemed
that
all
these
men
now
that
they
had
stopped
amid
fields
in
the
chill
dusk
of
the
autumn
evening
experienced
one
and
the
same
feeling
of
unpleasant
awakening
from
the
hurry
and
eagerness
to
push
on
that
had
seized
them
at
the
start
.
once
at
a
standstill
they
all
seemed
to
understand
that
they
did
not
yet
know
where
they
were
going
and
that
much
that
was
painful
and
difficult
awaited
them
on
this
journey
.
during
this
halt
the
escort
treated
the
pris
oners
even
worse
than
they
had
done
at
the
start
.
it
was
here
that
the
prisoners
for
the
first
time
received
horseflesh
for
their
meat
ration
.
from
the
officer
down
to
the
lowest
soldier
they
all
showed
what
seemed
like
personal
spite
against
each
of
the
prisoners
in
unexpected
contrast
to
their
former
friendly
relations
.
this
spite
increased
still
more
when
on
call
ing
over
the
roll
of
prisoners
it
was
found
that
in
the
bustle
of
leaving
moscow
one
russian
soldier
who
had
pretended
to
suffer
from
colic
had
escaped
.
pierre
saw
a
frenchman
beat
a
russian
soldier
cruelly
for
straying
too
far
from
the
road
and
heard
his
friend
the
cap
tain
reprimand
and
threaten
to
courtmartial
a
noncommissioned
officer
on
account
of
the
escape
of
the
russian
.
to
the
noncommissioned
officers
excuse
that
the
prisoner
was
ill
and
could
not
walk
the
officer
replied
that
the
or
der
was
to
shoot
those
who
lagged
behind
.
pierre
felt
that
that
fatal
force
which
had
crushed
him
during
the
executions
but
which
he
had
not
felt
during
his
imprisonment
now
again
controlled
his
existence
.
it
was
terrible
but
he
felt
that
in
proportion
to
the
efforts
of
that
fatal
force
to
crush
him
there
grew
and
strengthened
in
his
soul
a
power
of
life
inde
pendent
of
it
.
he
ate
his
supper
of
buckwheat
soup
with
horseflesh
and
chatted
with
his
comrades
.
neither
pierre
nor
any
of
the
others
spoke
of
what
they
had
seen
in
moscow
or
of
the
roughness
of
their
treatment
by
the
french
or
of
the
order
to
shoot
them
which
had
been
an
nounced
to
them
.
as
if
in
reaction
against
the
worsening
of
their
position
they
were
all
par
ticularly
animated
and
gay
.
they
spoke
of
per
sonal
reminiscences
of
amusing
scenes
they
had
witnessed
during
the
campaign
and
avoid
ed
all
talk
of
their
present
situation
.
the
sun
had
set
long
since
.
bright
stars
shone
out
here
and
there
in
the
sky
.
a
red
glow
as
of
a
conflagration
spread
above
the
horizon
from
the
rising
full
moon
and
that
vast
red
ball
swayed
strangely
in
the
gray
haze
.
it
grew
light
.
the
evening
was
ending
but
the
night
had
not
yet
come
.
pierre
got
up
and
left
his
new
com
panions
crossing
between
the
campfires
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
where
he
had
been
told
the
common
soldier
prisoners
were
stationed
.
he
wanted
to
talk
to
them
.
on
the
road
he
was
stopped
by
a
french
sentinel
who
ordered
him
back
.
pierre
turned
back
not
to
his
companions
by
the
campfire
but
to
an
unharnessed
cart
where
there
was
nobody
.
tucking
his
legs
un
der
him
and
dropping
his
head
he
sat
down
on
the
cold
ground
by
the
wheel
of
the
cart
and
remained
motionless
a
long
while
sunk
in
thought
.
suddenly
he
burst
out
into
a
fit
of
his
broad
goodnatured
laughter
so
loud
that
men
from
various
sides
turned
with
surprise
to
see
what
this
strange
and
evidently
solitary
laughter
could
mean
.
hahaha
laughed
pierre
.
and
he
said
aloud
to
himself
the
soldier
did
not
let
me
pass
.
they
took
me
and
shut
me
up
.
they
hold
me
captive
.
what
me
me
my
immortal
soul
hahaha
hahaha

.

.

.
and
he
laughed
till
tears
started
to
his
eyes
.
a
man
got
up
and
came
to
see
what
this
queer
big
fellow
was
laughing
at
all
by
him
self
.
pierre
stopped
laughing
got
up
went
farther
away
from
the
inquisitive
man
and
looked
around
him
.
the
huge
endless
bivouac
that
had
previ
ously
resounded
with
the
cracklingof
campfires
and
the
voices
of
many
men
had
grown
quiet
the
red
campfires
were
growing
paler
and
dy
ing
down
.
high
up
in
the
light
sky
hung
the
full
moon
.
forests
and
fields
beyond
the
camp
unseen
before
were
now
visible
in
the
dis
582
tance
.
and
farther
still
beyond
those
forests
and
fields
the
bright
oscillating
limitless
dis
tance
lured
one
to
itself
.
pierre
glanced
up
at
the
sky
and
the
twinkling
stars
in
its
faraway
depths
.
and
all
that
is
me
all
that
is
within
me
and
it
is
all
ii
thought
pierre
.
and
they
caught
all
that
and
put
it
into
a
shed
boarded
up
with
planks
he
smiled
and
went
and
lay
down
to
sleep
beside
his
companions
.
chapter
xv
in
the
early
days
of
october
another
envoy
came
to
kutuzov
with
a
letter
from
napoleon
proposing
peace
and
falsely
dated
from
mos
cow
though
napoleon
was
already
not
far
from
kutuzov
on
the
old
kaluga
road
.
kutu
zov
replied
to
this
letter
as
he
had
done
to
the
one
formerly
brought
by
lauriston
saying
that
there
could
be
no
question
of
peace
.
soon
after
that
a
report
was
received
from
d6rokhovs
guerrilla
detachment
operating
to
the
left
of
tariitino
that
troops
of
broussiers
division
had
been
seen
at
forminsk
and
that
being
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
french
army
they
might
easily
be
destroyed
.
the
soldiers
and
officers
again
demanded
action
.
generals
on
the
staff
excited
by
the
memory
of
the
easy
victory
at
tanitino
urged
kutuzov
to
carry
out
dorokhovs
suggestion
.
kutuzov
did
not
consider
any
offensive
necessary
.
the
result
was
a
compromise
which
was
inevitable
a
small
detachment
was
sent
to
formfnsk
to
attack
broussier
.
by
a
strange
coincidence
this
task
which
turned
out
to
be
a
most
difficult
and
important
one
was
entrusted
to
dokhtiirov
that
same
modest
little
dokhtiirov
whom
no
one
had
de
scribed
to
us
as
drawing
up
plans
of
battles
dashing
about
in
front
of
regiments
shower
ing
crosses
on
batteries
and
so
on
and
who
was
thought
to
be
and
was
spoken
of
as
un
decided
and
undiscerning
but
whom
we
find
commanding
wherever
the
position
was
most
difficult
all
through
the
russofrench
wars
from
austerlitz
to
the
year
1813
.
at
austerlitz
he
remained
last
at
the
augezd
dam
rallying
the
regiments
saving
what
was
possible
when
all
were
flying
and
perishing
and
not
a
single
general
was
left
in
the
rearguard
.
ill
with
fever
he
went
to
smolensk
with
twenty
thousand
men
to
defend
the
town
against
napoleons
whole
army
.
in
smolensk
at
the
maldkhov
gate
he
had
hardly
dozed
off
in
a
paroxysm
of
fever
before
he
was
awakened
by
the
bombard
ment
of
the
town
and
smolensk
held
out
all
day
long
.
at
the
battle
of
borodin6
when
war
and
peace
bagrati6n
was
killed
and
nine
tenths
of
the
men
of
our
left
flank
had
fallen
and
the
full
force
of
the
french
artillery
fire
was
directed
against
it
the
man
sent
there
was
this
same
irresolute
and
undiscerning
dokhtiirov
kut
uzov
hastening
to
rectify
a
mistake
he
had
made
by
sending
someone
else
there
first
.
and
the
quiet
little
dokhtiirov
rode
thither
and
borodin6
became
the
greatest
glory
of
the
russian
army
.
many
heroes
have
been
de
scribed
to
us
in
verse
and
prose
but
of
dokh
tiirov
scarcely
a
word
has
been
said
.
it
was
dokhtiirov
again
whom
they
sent
to
formfnsk
and
from
there
to
mdloyarosldvets
the
place
where
the
last
battle
with
the
french
was
fought
and
where
the
obvious
disintegra
tion
of
the
french
army
began
and
we
are
told
of
many
geniuses
and
heroes
of
that
period
of
the
campaign
but
of
dokhtiirov
nothing
or
very
little
is
said
and
that
dubi
ously
.
and
this
silence
about
dokhtiirov
is
the
clearest
testimony
to
his
merit
.
it
is
natural
for
a
man
who
docs
not
under
stand
the
workings
of
a
machine
to
imagine
that
a
shaving
that
has
fallen
into
it
by
chance
and
is
interfering
with
its
action
and
tossing
about
in
it
is
its
most
important
part
.
the
man
who
does
not
understand
the
construction
of
the
machine
cannot
conceive
that
the
small
connecting
cogwheel
which
revolves
quietly
is
one
of
the
most
essential
parts
of
the
machine
and
not
the
shaving
which
merely
harms
and
hinders
the
working
.
on
the
tenth
of
october
when
dokhtiirov
had
gone
halfway
to
forminsk
and
stopped
at
the
village
of
arist6vo
preparing
faithfully
to
execute
the
orders
he
had
received
the
whole
french
army
having
in
its
convulsive
move
ment
reached
murats
position
apparently
in
order
to
give
battle
suddenly
without
any
reason
turned
off
to
the
left
onto
the
new
kaluga
road
and
began
to
enter
formfnsk
where
only
broussier
had
been
till
then
.
at
that
time
dokhtiirov
had
under
his
command
besides
d6rokhovs
detachment
the
two
small
guerrilla
detachments
of
figner
and
sesldvin
.
on
the
evening
of
october
1
1
seslvin
came
to
the
arist6vo
headquarters
with
a
french
guardsman
he
had
captured
.
the
prisoner
said
that
the
troops
that
had
entered
formfnsk
that
day
were
the
vanguard
of
the
whole
army
that
napoleon
was
there
and
the
whole
army
had
left
moscow
four
days
previously
.
that
same
evening
a
house
serf
who
had
come
from
borovsk
said
he
had
seen
an
immense
army
entering
the
town
.
some
cossacks
of
dokhtii
book
thirteen
rovs
detachment
reported
having
sighted
the
french
guards
marching
along
the
road
to
b6rovsk
.
from
all
these
reports
it
was
evident
that
where
they
had
expected
to
meet
a
single
division
there
was
now
the
whole
french
army
marching
from
moscow
in
an
unexpected
di
rectionalong
the
kaluga
road
.
dokhturov
was
unwilling
to
undertake
any
action
as
it
was
not
clear
to
him
now
what
he
ought
to
do
.
he
had
been
ordered
to
attack
formfnsk
.
but
only
broussier
had
been
there
at
that
time
and
now
the
whole
french
army
was
there
.
erm6
lov
wished
to
act
on
his
own
judgment
but
dokhturov
insisted
that
he
must
have
kutii
zovs
instructions
.
so
it
was
decided
to
send
a
dispatch
to
the
staff
.
for
this
purpose
a
capable
officer
bolkhovf
tinov
was
chosen
who
was
to
explain
the
whole
affair
by
word
of
mouth
besides
deliver
ing
a
written
report
.
toward
midnight
bolk
hovitinov
having
received
the
dispatch
and
verbal
instructions
galloped
off
to
the
general
staff
accompanied
by
a
cossack
with
spare
horses
.
583
chapter
xvi
it
was
a
warm
dark
autumn
night
.
it
had
been
raining
for
four
days
.
having
changed
horses
twice
and
galloped
twenty
miles
in
an
hour
and
a
half
over
a
sticky
muddy
road
bolkhovitinov
reached
litashevka
after
one
oclock
at
night
.
dismounting
at
a
cottage
on
whose
wattle
fence
hung
a
signboard
general
staff
and
throwing
down
his
reins
he
en
tered
a
dark
passage
.
the
general
on
duty
quickl
its
very
im
portant
said
he
to
someone
who
had
risen
and
was
sniffing
in
the
dark
passage
.
he
has
been
very
unwell
since
the
evening
and
this
is
the
third
night
he
has
not
slept
said
the
orderly
pleadingly
in
a
whisper
.
you
should
wake
the
captain
first
.
but
this
is
very
important
from
general
dokhturov
said
bolkhovitinov
entering
the
open
door
which
he
had
found
by
feeling
in
the
dark
.
the
orderly
had
gone
in
before
him
and
began
waking
somebody
.

he
is
very
ill
.
perhaps
this
is
only
a
rumor
.
here
is
the
dispatch
said
bolkhovitinov
.
my
orders
are
to
give
it
at

to
the

eral
on

you
damned
rascal
where
do
you
always
hide
it
said
the
voice
of
the
man
who
was
stretching
himself
to
the
orderly
.
this
was
shcherbinin
konovnitsyns
adjutant
.

he
added
.
the
orderly
was
striking
a
light
and
shcher
bfnin
was
fumbling
for
something
on
the
candlestick
.
oh
the
nasty
beasts
said
he
with
disgust
.
by
the
light
of
the
sparks
bolkhovftinov
saw
shcherbinins
youthful
face
as
he
held
the
candle
and
the
face
of
another
man
who
was
still
asleep
.
this
was
konovnitsyn
.
when
the
flame
of
the
sulphur
splinters
kindled
by
the
tinder
burned
up
first
blue
and
then
red
shcherbinin
lit
the
tallow
candle
from
the
candlestick
of
which
the
cockroaches
that
had
been
gnawing
it
were
running
away
and
looked
at
the
messenger
.
bolkhovitinov
was
bespattered
all
over
with
mud
and
had
smeared
his
face
by
wiping
it
with
his
sleeve
.
who
gave
the
report
inquired
shchfer
binin
taking
the
envelope
.
the
news
is
reliable
said
bolkhovitinov
.
prisoners
cossacks
and
the
scouts
all
say
the
same
thing
.
theres
nothing
to
be
done
well
have
to
wake
him
said
shcherbinin
rising
and
going
up
to
the
man
in
the
nightcap
who
lay
cov
ered
by
a
greatcoat
.
peter
petrovichi
said
he
.
konovnftsyn
did
not
stir
.
to
the
general
staff
he
said
with
a
smile
knowing
that
those
words
would
be
sure
to
arouse
him
.
and
in
fact
the
head
in
the
nightcap
was
lifted
at
once
.
on
konovnitsyns
handsome
resolute
face
with
checks
flushed
by
fever
there
still
remained
for
an
instant
a
faraway
dreamy
expression
remote
from
present
af
fairs
but
then
he
suddenly
started
and
his
face
assumed
its
habitual
calm
and
firm
ap
pearance
.
well
what
is
it
from
whom
he
asked
immediately
but
without
hurry
blinking
at
the
light
.
while
listening
to
theofficers
report
konov
nftsyn
broke
the
seal
and
read
the
dispatch
.
hardly
had
he
done
so
before
he
lowered
his
war
and
peace
legs
in
their
woolen
stockings
to
the
earthen
floor
and
began
putting
on
his
boots
.
then
he
took
off
his
nightcap
combed
his
hair
over
his
temples
and
donned
his
cap
.
did
you
get
here
quickly
let
us
go
to
his
highness
.
konovnftsyn
had
understood
at
once
that
the
news
brought
was
of
great
importance
and
that
no
time
must
be
lost
.
he
did
not
consider
or
ask
himself
whether
the
news
was
good
or
bad
.
that
did
not
interest
him
.
he
regarded
the
whole
business
of
the
war
not
with
his
intelligence
or
his
reason
but
by
something
else
.
there
was
within
him
a
deep
unex
pressed
conviction
that
all
would
be
well
but
that
one
must
not
trust
to
this
and
still
less
speak
about
it
but
must
only
attend
to
ones
own
work
.
and
he
did
his
work
giving
his
whole
strength
to
the
task
.
peter
petr6vich
konovnftsyn
like
dokhtu
rov
seems
to
have
been
included
merely
for
proprietys
sake
in
the
list
of
the
socalled
heroes
of
1812
the
barclays
ravskis
erm6
lovs
pldtovs
and
milordoviches
.
like
dokh
turov
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
man
of
very
limited
capacity
and
information
and
like
dokhturov
he
never
made
plans
of
battle
but
was
always
found
where
the
situation
was
most
difficult
.
since
his
appointment
as
gen
eral
on
duty
he
had
always
slept
with
his
door
open
giving
orders
that
every
messenger
should
be
allowed
to
wake
him
up
.
in
battle
he
was
always
under
fire
so
that
kutuzov
re
proved
him
for
it
and
feared
to
send
him
to
the
front
and
like
dokhturov
he
was
one
of
those
unnoticed
cogwheels
that
without
clat
ter
or
noise
constitute
the
most
essential
part
of
the
machine
.
coming
out
of
the
hut
into
the
damp
dark
night
konovnitsyn
frowned
partly
from
an
increased
pain
in
his
head
and
partly
at
the
unpleasant
thought
that
occurred
to
him
of
how
all
that
nest
of
influential
men
on
the
staff
would
be
stirred
up
by
this
news
espe
cially
bennigsen
who
ever
since
tariitino
had
been
at
daggers
drawn
with
kutuzov
and
how
they
would
make
suggestions
quarrel
issue
orders
and
rescind
them
.
and
this
premoni
tion
was
disagreeable
to
him
though
he
knew
it
could
not
be
helped
.
and
in
fact
toll
to
whom
he
went
to
com
municate
the
news
immediately
began
to
ex
pound
his
plans
to
a
general
sharing
his
quar
ters
until
konovnftsyn
who
listened
in
weary
silence
reminded
him
that
they
must
go
to
see
his
highness
.
chapter
xvii
kurtizov
like
all
old
people
did
not
sleep
much
at
night
.
he
often
fell
asleep
unex
pectedly
in
the
daytime
but
at
night
lying
on
his
bed
without
undressing
he
generally
remained
awake
thinking
.
so
he
lay
now
on
his
bed
supporting
his
large
heavy
scarred
head
on
his
plump
hand
with
his
one
eye
open
meditating
and
peer
ing
into
the
darkness
.
since
bennigsen
who
corresponded
with
the
emperor
and
had
more
influence
than
anyone
else
on
the
staff
had
begun
to
avoid
him
kutuzov
was
more
at
ease
as
to
the
pos
sibility
of
himself
and
his
troops
being
obliged
to
take
part
in
useless
aggressive
movements
.
the
lesson
of
the
tariitino
battle
and
of
the
day
before
it
which
kutuzov
remembered
with
pain
must
he
thought
have
some
effect
on
others
too
.
they
must
understand
that
we
can
only
lose
by
taking
the
offensive
.
patience
and
time
are
my
warriors
my
champions
thought
kutuzov
.
he
knew
that
an
apple
should
not
be
plucked
while
it
is
green
.
it
will
fall
of
it
self
when
ripe
but
if
picked
unripe
the
apple
is
spoiled
the
tree
is
harmed
and
your
teeth
are
set
on
edge
.
like
an
experienced
sports
man
he
knew
that
the
beast
was
wounded
and
wounded
as
only
the
whole
strength
of
russia
could
have
wounded
it
but
whether
it
was
mortally
wounded
or
not
was
still
an
unde
cided
question
.
now
by
the
fact
of
lauriston
and
barththemi
having
been
sent
and
by
the
reports
of
the
guerrillas
kutuzov
was
almost
sure
that
the
wound
was
mortal
.
but
he
needed
further
proofs
and
it
was
necessary
to
wait
.
they
want
to
run
to
see
how
they
have
wounded
it
.
wait
and
we
shall
see
continual
maneuvers
continual
advances
thought
he
.
what
for
only
to
distinguish
themselves
as
if
fighting
were
fun
.
they
are
like
children
from
whom
one
cant
get
any
sensible
account
of
what
has
happened
because
they
all
want
to
show
how
well
they
can
fight
.
but
thats
not
what
is
needed
now
.
and
what
ingenious
maneuvers
they
all
propose
to
me
it
seems
to
them
that
when
they
have
thought
of
two
or
three
contin
gencies
he
remembered
the
general
plan
sent
him
from
petersburg
they
have
fore
seen
everything
.
but
the
contingencies
are
endless
.
the
undecided
question
as
to
whether
the
wound
inflicted
at
borodin6
was
mortal
or
not
had
hung
over
kutuzovs
head
for
a
whole
month
.
on
the
one
hand
the
french
had
oc
cupied
moscow
.
on
the
other
kutiizov
felt
assured
with
all
his
being
that
the
terrible
blow
into
which
he
and
all
the
russians
had
put
their
whole
strength
must
have
been
mor
tal
.
but
in
any
case
proofs
were
needed
he
had
waited
a
whole
month
for
them
and
grew
more
impatient
the
longer
he
waited
.
lying
on
his
bed
during
those
sleepless
nights
he
did
just
what
he
reproached
those
younger
gen
erals
for
doing
.
he
imagined
all
sorts
of
pos
sible
contingencies
just
like
the
younger
men
but
with
this
difference
that
he
saw
thousands
of
contingencies
instead
of
two
or
three
and
based
nothing
on
them
.
the
longer
he
thought
the
more
contingencies
presented
themselves
.
he
imagined
all
sorts
of
move
ments
of
the
napoleonic
army
as
a
whole
or
in
sections
against
petersburg
or
against
him
or
to
outflank
him
.
he
thought
too
of
the
possibility
which
he
feared
most
of
all
that
napoleon
might
fight
him
with
his
own
weapon
and
remain
in
moscow
awaiting
him
.
kutuzov
even
imagined
that
napoleons
army
might
turn
back
through
medyn
and
yukh
nov
but
the
one
thing
he
could
not
foresee
was
what
happenedthe
insane
convulsive
stampede
of
napoleons
army
during
its
first
eleven
days
after
leaving
moscow
a
stampede
which
made
possible
what
kutuzov
had
not
yet
even
dared
to
think
of
the
complete
ex
termination
of
the
french
.
dorokhovs
report
about
broussiers
division
the
guerrillas
re
ports
of
distress
in
napoleons
army
rumors
of
preparations
for
leaving
moscow
all
con
firmed
the
supposition
that
the
french
army
was
beaten
and
preparing
for
flight
.
but
these
were
only
suppositions
which
seemed
im
portant
to
the
younger
men
but
not
to
kutu
zov
.
with
his
sixty
years
experience
he
knew
what
value
to
attach
to
rumors
knew
how
apt
people
who
desire
anything
are
to
group
all
news
so
that
it
appears
to
confirm
what
they
desire
and
he
knew
how
readily
in
such
cases
they
omit
all
that
makes
for
the
contrary
.
and
the
more
he
desired
it
the
less
he
allowed
him
self
to
believe
it
.
this
question
absorbed
all
his
mental
powers
.
all
else
was
to
him
only
lifes
customary
routine
.
to
such
customary
routine
belonged
his
conversations
with
the
staff
the
letters
he
wrote
from
tarutino
to
madame
de
stael
the
reading
of
novels
the
distribution
of
awards
his
correspondence
with
petersburg
and
so
on
.
but
the
destruc
tion
of
the
french
which
he
alone
foresaw
was
his
hearts
one
desire
.

on
the
night
of
the
eleventh
of

he
lay
leaning
on
his
arm
and
thinking
of
that
.
there
was
a
stir
in
the
next
room
and
he
heard
the
steps
of

and

footman
was
lighting

toll
communicated
the
substance
of
the
news
.
who

asked
kutuzov
with
a

sat

leg
hanging
down
from

bed
and
his
big
paunch
resting
against
the
other
which
was
doubled
under
him

he
screwed
up
his
seeing

to
scrutinize
the

carefully

if

to

in

from
the
time
he
received
this
news
to
the
end
of
the
campaign
all
kutuzovs
activity
was
directed
toward
restraining
his
troops
by
authority
by
guile
and
by
entreaty
from
use
less
attacks
maneuvers
or
encounters
with
the
perishing
enemy
.
dokhtiirov
went
to
mloyarosldvets
but
kutiizov
lingered
with
the
main
army
and
gave
orders
for
the
evacua
tion
of
kaluga
a
retreat
beyond
which
town

seemed
to
him
quite
possible
everywhere
kuttizov
retreated
but
the
en
emy
without
waiting
for
his
retreat
fled
in
the
opposite
direction
.
napoleons
historians
describe
to
us
his
skilled
maneuvers
at
tarutino
and
malo
yaroslavets
and
make
conjectures
as
to
what
would
have
happened
had
napoleon
been
in
time
to
penetrate
into
the
rich
southern
prov
inces
.
but
not
to
speak
of
the
fact
that
nothing
prevented
him
from
advancing
into
those
southern
provinces
for
the
russian
army
did
not
bar
his
way
the
historians
forget
that
nothing
could
have
saved
his
army
for
then
already
it
bore
within
itself
the
germs
of
in
evitable
ruin
.
how
could
that
army
which
had
found
abundant
supplies
in
moscow
and
had
trampled
them
underfoot
instead
of
keep
ing
them
and
on
arriving
at
smolensk
had
looted
provisions
instead
of
storing
them
how
could
that
army
recuperate
in
kaluga
province
which
was
inhabited
by
russians
such
as
those
who
lived
in
moscow
and
where
fire
had
the
same
property
of
consuming
what
was
set
ablaze
that
army
could
not
recover
anywhere
.
since
the
battle
of
borodin6
and
the
pillage
of
moscow
it
had
borne
within
itself
as
it
were
the
chemical
elements
of
dissolution
.
the
members
of
what
had
once
been
an
army
napoleon
himself
and
all
his
soldiers
fled
without
knowing
whither
each
concerned
only
to
make
his
escape
as
quickly
as
possible
from
this
position
of
the
hopelessness
of
which
they
were
all
more
or
less
vaguely
con
scious
.
so
it
came
about
that
at
the
council
at
maloyaroslavets
when
the
generals
pretend
ing
to
confer
together
expressed
various
opin
ions
all
mouths
were
closed
by
the
opinion
uttered
by
the
simpleminded
soldier
mouton
who
speaking
last
said
what
they
all
felt
that
the
one
thing
needful
was
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
and
no
one
not
even
napoleon
could
say
anything
against
that
truth
which
they
all
recognized
.
but
though
they
all
realized
that
it
was
necessary
to
get
away
there
still
remained
a
feeling
of
shame
at
admitting
that
they
must
flee
.
an
external
shock
was
needed
to
over
come
that
shame
and
this
shock
came
in
due
time
.
it
was
what
the
french
called

the

after

at

vets
napoleon
rode
out
early
in
the
morning
amid
the
lines
of
his
army
with
his
suite
of
marshals
and
an
escort
on
the
pretext
of
in
specting
the
army
and
the
scene
of
the
pre
vious
and
of
the
impending
battle
.
some
cos
sacks
on
the
prowl
for
booty
fell
in
with
the
emperor
and
very
nearly
captured
him
.
if
the
cossacks
did
not
capture
napoleon
then
what
saved
him
was
the
very
thing
that
was
destroy
ing
the
french

booty
on
which
the
cossacks
fell

napoleon
they
rushed
after
the
plunder
and
napoleon
managed
to
escape
.
when
les
enfants
du
don
might
so
easily
have
taken
the
emperor
himself
in
the
midst
of
his
army
it
was
clear
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
fly
as
fast
as
possible
along
the
nearest
familiar
road
.
napoleon
with
his
fortyyearold
stomach
understood
that
hint
not
feeling
his
former
agility
and
boldness
and
under
the
influence
of
the
fright
the
cos
sacks
had
given
him
he
at
once
agreed
with
mouton
and
issued
orders
as
the
historians
tell
us
to
retreat
by
the
smolensk
road
.
that
napoleon
agreed
with
mouton
and
that
the
army
retreated
does
not
prove
that
napoleon
caused
it
to
retreat
but
that
the
forces
which
influenced
the
whole
army
and
directed
it
along
the
mozhdysk
that
is
the
smolensk
road
acted
simultaneously
on
him
also
.

a
man
in

always
devises
an
aim
for
that
motion

to
be
able
to
go
a
thousand
miles
he
must
imagine
that
something
good
awaits
him
at
the
end
of
those
thousand
miles
.
one
must
have
the
prospect
of
a
promised
land
to
have
the
strength
to

.
the
promised
land
for
the
french
during
their
advance
had
been
moscow
during
their
retreat
it
was
their
native
land
.
but
that
native
land
was
too
far
off
and
for
a
man
going
a
thousand
miles
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
set
aside
his
final
goal
and
to
say
to
himself
today
i
shall
get
to
a
place
twentyfive
miles
off
where
i
shall
rest
and
spend
the
night
and
during
the
first
days
journey
that
resting
place
eclipses
his
ultimate
goal
and
attracts
all
his
hopes
and
desires
.
and
the
impulses
felt
by
a
single
person
are
always
magnified
in
a
crowd
.
for
the
french
retreating
along
the
old
smolensk
road
the
final
goal
their
native
book
thirteen

land
was
too
remote
and
their
immediate
goal
was
smolensk
toward
which
all
their
desires
and
hopes
enormously
intensified
in
the
mass
urged
them
on
.
it
was
not
that
they
knew
that
much
food
and
fresh
troops
await
ed
them
in
smolensk
nor
that
they
were
told
so
on
the
contrary
their
superior
officers
and
napoleon
himself
knew
that
provisions
were
scarce
there
but
because
this
alone
could
give
them
strength
to
move
on
and
endure
their
present
privations
.
so
both
those
who
knew
and
those
who
did
not
know
deceived
them
selves
and
pushed
on
to
smolensk
as
to
a
promised
land
.
coming
out
onto
the
highroad
the
french
fled
with
surprising
energy
and
unheardof
rapidity
toward
the
goal
they
had
fixed
on
.
besides
the
common
impulse
which
bound
the
whole
crowd
of
french
into
one
mass
and
supplied
them
with
a
certain
energy
there
was
another
cause
binding
them
together
their
great
numbers
.
as
with
the
physical
law
of
gravity
their
enormous
mass
drew
the
individ
ual
human
atoms
to
itself
.
in
their
hundreds
of
thousands
they
moved
like
a
whole
nation
.
each
of
them
desired
nothing
more
than
to
give
himself
up
as
a
prisoner
to
escape
from
all
this
horror
and
misery
but
on
the
one
hand
the
force
of
this
common
attraction
to
smolensk
their
goal
drew
each
of
them
in
the
same
direction
on
the
other
hand
an
army
corps
could
not
surrender
to
a
company
and
though
the
french
availed
themselves
of
every
convenient
opportunity
to
detach
them
selves
and
to
surrender
on
the
slightest
decent
pretext
such
pretexts
did
not
always
occur
.
their
very
numbers
and
their
crowded
and
swift
movement
deprived
them
of
that
possi
bility
and
rendered
it
not
only
difficult
but
impossible
for
the
russians
to
stop
this
move
ment
to
which
the
french
were
directing
all
their
energies
.
beyond
a
certain
limit
no
me
chanical
disruption
of
the

could
hasten
the
process
of

to
seize
to
capture
and
to
overthrow

french
and
all
clamored
for
action
.
kutuzov
alone
used
all
his
power
and
such
power
is
very
limited
in
the
case
of
any

what
is
the

of
that
when
a
third
of
their
army
has
melted
away
on
the
road
from
moscow
to

without
any
battle
but
drawing
from
his
aged
wisdom
what
they
could
understand
he
told
them

i
the
battle
of
borodin6
with
the
occupation
of
moscow
that
followed
it
and
the
flight
of
the
french
without
further
conflicts
is
one
of
the
most
instructive
phenomena
in
history
.
all
historians
agree
that
the
external
activ
ity
of
states
and
nations
in
their
conflicts
with
one
another
is
expressed
in
wars
and
that
as
a
direct
result
of
greater
or
less
success
in
war
the
political
strength
of
states
and
nations
in
creases
or
decreases
.
strange
as
may
be
the
historical
account
of
how
some
king
or
emperor
having
quarreled
with
another
collects
an
army
fights
his
enemys
army
gains
a
victory
by
killing
three
five
or
ten
thousand
men
and
subjugates
a
kingdom
and
an
entire
nation
of
several
mil
lions
all
the
facts
of
history
as
far
as
we
know
it
confirm
the
truth
of
the
statement
that
the
greater
or
lesser
success
of
one
army
against
another
is
the
cause
or
at
least
an
essential
indication
of
an
increase
or
decrease
in
the
strength
of
the
nation
even
though
it
is
un
intelligible
why
the
defeat
of
an
army
a
hundredth
part
of
a
nation
should
oblige
that
whole
nation
to
submit
.
an
army
gains
a
victory
and
at
once
the
rights
of
the
conquer
ing
nation
have
increased
to
the
detriment
of
the
defeated
.
an
army
has
suffered
defeat
and
at
once
a
people
loses
its
rights
in
proportion
to
the
severity
of
the
reverse
and
if
its
army
suffers
a
complete
defeat
the
nation
is
quite
subjugated
.
so
according
to
history
it
has
been
found
from
the
most
ancient
times
and
so
it
is
to
our
own
day
.
all
napoleons
wars
serve
to
confirm
this
rule
.
in
proportion
to
the
defeat
of
the
austrian
army
austria
loses
its
rights
and
the
rights
and
the
strength
of
france
increase
.
the
victories
of
the
french
at
jena
and
auer
stadt
destroy
the
independent
existence
of
prussia
.
but
then
in
1812
the
french
gain
a
victory
near
moscow
.
moscow
is
taken
and
after
that
with
no
further
battles
it
is
not
russia
that
ceases
to
exist
but
the
french
army
of
six
hundred
thousand
and
then
napoleonic
france
itself
.
to
strain
the
facts
to
fit
the
rules
of
history
to
say
that
the
field
of
battle
at
borodino
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
rus
sians
or
that
after
moscow
there
were
other
battles
that
destroyed
napoleons
army
is
im
possible
.
after
the
french
victory
at
borodin6
there
was
no
general
engagement
nor
any
that
were
at
all
serious
yet
the
french
army
ceased
to
exist
.
what
does
this
mean
if
it
were
an
ex
ample
taken
from
the
history
of
china
we
might
say
that
it
was
not
an
historic
phenom
enon
which
is
the
historians
usual
expedient
when
anything
does
not
fit
their
standards
if
the
matter
concerned
some
brief
conflict
in
which
only
a
small
number
of
troops
took
part
we
might
treat
it
as
an
exception
but
this
event
occurred
before
our
fathers
eyes
and
for
them
it
was
a
question
of
the
life
or
death
of
their
fatherland
and
it
happened
in
the
greatest
of
all
known
wars
.
the
period
of
the
campaign
of
1812
from
the
battle
of
borodino
to
the
expulsion
of
the
french
proved
that
the
winning
of
a
battle
does
not
produce
a
conquest
and
is
not
even
an
invariable
indication
of
conquest
it
proved
that
the
force
which
decides
the
fate
of
peoples
lies
not
in
the
conquerors
nor
even
in
armies
and
battles
but
in
something
else
.
the
french
historians
describing
the
con
dition
of
the
french
army
before
it
left
mos
cow
affirm
that
all
was
in
order
in
the
grand
army
except
the
cavalry
the
artillery
and
the
transport
there
was
no
forage
for
the
horses
or
the
cattle
.
that
was
a
misfortune
no
one
could
remedy
for
the
peasants
of
the
district
burned
their
hay
rather
than
let
the
french
have
it
.
the
victory
gained
did
not
bring
the
usual
results
because
the
peasants
karp
and
vlas
who
after
the
french
had
evacuated
moscow
drove
in
their
carts
to
pillage
the
town
and
in
general
personally
failed
to
manifest
any
book
fourteen
heroic
feelings
and
the
whole
innumerable
multitude
of
such
peasants
did
not
bring
their
hay
to
moscow
for
the
high
price
offered
them
but
burned
it
instead
.
let
us
imagine
two
men
who
have
come
out
to
fight
a
duel
with
rapiers
according
to
all
the
rules
of
the
art
of
fencing
.
the
fencing
has
gone
on
for
some
time
suddenly
one
of
the
combatants
feeling
himself
wounded
and
understanding
that
the
matter
is
no
joke
but
concerns
his
life
throws
down
his
rapier
and
seizing
the
first
cudgel
that
comes
to
hand
begins
to
brandish
it
.
then
let
us
imagine
that
the
combatant
who
so
sensibly
employed
the
best
and
simplest
means
to
attain
his
end
was
at
the
same
time
influenced
by
traditions
of
chivalry
and
desiring
to
conceal
the
facts
of
the
case
insisted
that
he
had
gained
his
vic
tory
with
the
rapier
according
to
all
the
rules
of
art
.
one
can
imagine
what
confusion
and
obscurity
would
result
from
such
an
account
of
the
duel
.
the
fencer
who
demanded
a
contest
accord
ing
to
the
rules
of
fencing
was
the
french
army
his
opponent
who
threw
away
the
rapier
and
snatched
up
the
cudgel
was
the
russian
people
those
who
try
to
explain
the
matter
according
to
the
rules
of
fencing
are
the
his
torians
who
have
described
the
event
.
after
the
burning
of
smolensk
a
war
began
which
did
not
follow
any
previous
traditions
of
war
.
the
burning
of
towns
and
villages
the
retreats
after
battles
the
blow
dealt
at
boro
din6
and
the
renewed
retreat
the
burning
of
moscow
the
capture
of
marauders
the
seizure
of
transports
and
the
guerrilla
war
were
all
de
partures
from
the
rules
.
napoleon
felt
this
and
from
the
time
he
took
up
the
correct
fencing
attitude
in
moscow
and
instead
of
his
opponents
rapier
saw
a
cudgel
raised
above
his
head
he
did
not
cease
to
complain
to
kutuzov
and
to
the
emperor
alexander
that
the
war
was
being
carried
on
contrary
to
all
the
rules
as
if
there
were
any
rules
for
killing
people
.
in
spite
of
the
com
plaints
of
the
french
as
to
the
nonobservance
of
the
rules
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
to
some
highly
placed
russians
it
seemed
rather
dis
graceful
to
fight
widi
a
cudgel
and
they
wanted
to
assume
a
pose
en
quarie
or
en
tierce
accord
ing
to
all
the
rules
and
to
make
an
adroit
thrust
en
prime
and
so
on
the
cudgel
of
the
peoples
war
was
lifted
with
all
its
menacing
and
majestic
strength
and
without
consulting
anyones
tastes
or
rules
and
regardless
of
any
thing
else
it
rose
and
fell
with
stupid
simplic
589
ity
but
consistently
and
belabored
the
french
till
the
whole
invasion
had
perished
.
and
it
is
well
for
a
people
who
do
not
as
the
french
did
in
1813
salute
according
to
all
the
rules
of
art
and
presenting
the
hilt
of
their
rapier
gracefully
and
politely
hand
it
to
their
magnanimous
conqueror
but
at
the
moment
of
trial
without
asking
what
rules
others
have
adopted
in
similar
cases
simply
and
easily
pick
up
the
first
cudgel
that
comes
to
hand
and
strike
with
it
till
the
feeling
of
resentment
and
revenge
in
their
soul
yields
to
a
feeling
of
con
tempt
and
compassion
.
chapter
ii
one
of
the
most
obvious
and
advantageous
departures
from
the
socalled
laws
of
war
is
the
action
of
scattered
groups
against
men
pressed
together
in
a
mass
.
such
action
always
occurs
in
wars
that
take
on
a
national
character
.
in
such
actions
instead
of
two
crowds
opposing
each
other
the
men
disperse
attack
singly
run
away
when
attacked
by
stronger
forces
but
again
attack
when
opportunity
offers
.
this
was
done
by
the
guerrillas
in
spain
by
the
moun
tain
tribes
in
the
caucasus
and
by
the
russians
in
1812
.
people
have
called
this
kind
of
war
guer
rilla
warfare
and
assume
that
by
so
calling
it
they
have
explained
its
meaning
.
but
such
a
war
does
not
fit
in
under
any
rule
and
is
di
rectly
opposed
to
a
wellknown
rule
of
tactics
which
is
accepted
as
infallible
.
that
rule
says
that
an
attacker
should
concentrate
his
forces
in
order
to
be
stronger
than
his
opponent
at
the
moment
of
conflict
.
guerrilla
war
always
successful
as
history
shows
directly
infringes
that
rule
.
this
contradiction
arises
from
the
fact
that
military
science
assumes
the
strength
of
an
army
to
be
identical
with
its
numbers
.
mili
tary
science
says
that
the
more
troops
the
greater
the
strength
.

for
military
science
to
say
this
is
like
defin
ing
momentum
in
mechanics
by
reference
to
the
mass
only
stating
that
momenta
are
equal
or
unequal
to
each
other
simply
because
the
masses
involved
are
equal
or
unequal
.
momentum
quantity
of
motion
is
the
product
of
mass
and
velocity
.
in
military
affairs
the
strength
of
an
army
is
the
product
of
its
mass
and
some
unknown
x
.

in

the
commanders
.
but
the
assignment
of
these
various
meanings
to
the
factor
does
not
yield
results
which
accord
with
the
historic
facts
.
yet
it
is
only
necessary
to
abandon
the
false
view
adopted
to
gratify
the
heroes
of
the
efficacy
of
the
directions
issued
in
wartime
by
commanders
in
order
to
find
this
unknown
quantity
.
that
unknown
quantity
is
the
spirit
of
the
army
that
is
to
say
the
greater
or
lesser
readi
ness
to
fight
and
face
danger
felt
by
all
the
men
composing
an
army
quite
independently
of
whether
they
are
or
are
not
fighting
under
the
command
of
a
genius
in
two
or
threeline
formation
with
cudgels
or
with
rifles
that
re
peat
thirty
times
a
minute
.
men
who
want
to
fight
will
always
put
themselves
in
the
most
advantageous
conditions
for
fighting
.
the
spirit
of
an
army
is
the
factor
which
multiplied
by
the
mass
gives
the
resulting
force
.
to
define
and
express
the
significance
of
this
unknown
factor
the
spirit
of
an
army
is
a
problem
for
science
.
this
problem
is
only
solvable
if
we
cease
arbitrarily
to
substitute
for
the
unknown
x
itself
the
conditions
under
which
that
force
becomes
apparent
such
as
the
commands
of
the
general
the
equipment
employed
and
so
on
mistaking
these
for
the
real
significance
of
the
factor
and
if
we
recognize
this
unknown
quantity
in
its
entirety
as
being
the
greater
or
lesser
desire
to
fight
and
to
face
danger
.
only
then
expressing
known
historic
facts
by
equa
tions
and
comparing
the
relative
significance
of
this
factor
can
we
hope
to
define
the
un
known
.
ten
men
battalions
or
divisions
fighting
fifteen
men
battalions
or
divisions
conquer
that
is
kill
or
take
captive
all
the
others
while
themselves
losing
four
so
that
on
the
one
side
four
and
on
the
other
fifteen
were
lost
.
consequently
the
four
were
equal
to
the
fifteen
and
therefore
4xi5j
.
consequently
xyi4
.
this
equation
does
not
give
us
the
value
of
the
unknown
factor
but
gives
us
a
ratio
between
two
unknowns
.
and
by
bring
ing
variously
selected
historic
units
battles
campaigns
periods
of
war
into
such
equa
tions
a
series
of
numbers
could
be
obtained
in
war
and
peace
which
certain
laws
should
exist
and
might
be
discovered
.
the
tactical
rule
that
an
army
should
act
in
masses
when
attacking
and
in
smaller
groups
in
retreat
unconsciously
confirms
the
truth
that
the
strength
of
an
army
depends
on
its
spirit
.
to
lead
men
forward
under
fire
more
discipline
obtainable
only
by
movement
in
masses
is
needed
than
is
needed
to
resist
at
tacks
.
but
this
rule
which
leaves
out
of
account
the
spirit
of
the
army
continually
proves
in
correct
and
is
in
particularly
striking
contrast
to
the
facts
when
some
strong
rise
or
fall
in
the
spirit
of
the
troops
occurs
as
in
all
national
wars
.
the
french
retreating
in
1812
though
ac
cording
to
tactics
they
should
have
separated
into
detachments
to
defend
themselves
con
gregated
into
a
mass
because
the
spirit
of
the
army
had
so
fallen
that
only
the
mass
held
the
army
together
.
the
russians
on
the
contrary
ought
according
to
tactics
to
have
attacked
in
mass
but
in
fact
they
split
up
into
small
units
because
their
spirit
had
so
risen
that
separate
individuals
without
orders
dealt
blows
at
the
french
without
needing
any
compulsion
to
in
duce
them
to
expose
themselves
to
hardships
and
dangers
.
chapter
iii
the
socalled
partisan
war
began
with
the
entry
of
the
french
into
smolensk
.
before
partisan
warfare
had
been
officially
recognized
by
the
government
thousands
of
enemy
stragglers
marauders
and
foragers
had
been
destroyed
by
the
cossacks
and
the
peas
ants
who
killed
them
off
as
instinctively
as
dogs
worry
a
stray

.mad
dog
to
death
.
denis
davy
dov
with
his
russian
instinct
was
the
first
to
recognize
the
value
of
this
terrible
cudgel
which
regardless
of
the
rules
of
military
sci
ence
destroyed
the
french
and
to
him
belongs
the
credit
for
taking
the
first
step
toward
regu
larizing
this
method
of
warfare
.
on
august
24
davydovs
first
partisan
de
tachment
was
formed
and
then
others
were
recognized
.
the
further
the
campaign
pro
gressed
the
more
numerous
these
detachments
became
.
the
irregulars
destroyed
the
great
army
piecemeal
.
they
gathered
the
fallen
leaves
that
dropped
of
themselves
from
that
withered
tree
the
french
army
and
sometimes
shook
that
tree
itself
.
by
october
when
the
french
were
fleeing
toward
smolensk
there
were
hundreds
of
such
companies
of
various
sizes
and
char
book
fourteen
icters
.
there
were
some
that
adopted
all
the
irmy
methods
and
had
infantry
artillery
rtaffs
and
the
comforts
of
life
.
others
con
sisted
solely
of
cossack
cavalry
.
there
were
also
small
scratch
groups
of
foot
and
horse
and
groups
of
peasants
and
landowners
that
re
mained
unknown
.
a
sacristan
commanded
one
party
which
captured
several
hundred
prison
ers
in
the
course
of
a
month
and
there
was
vasilfsa
the
wife
of
a
village
elder
who
slew
hundreds
of
the
french
.
the
partisan
warfare
flamed
up
most
fiercely
in
the
latter
daysof
october
.
its
first
period
had
passed
when
the
partisans
themselves
amazed
at
their
own
boldness
feared
every
minute
to
be
surrounded
and
captured
by
the
french
and
hid
in
the
forests
without
unsaddling
hardly
daring
to
dismount
and
always
expect
ing
to
be
pursued
.
by
the
end
of
october
this
kind
of
warfare
had
taken
definite
shape
it
had
become
clear
to
all
what
could
be
ventured
against
the
french
and
what
could
not
.
now
only
the
commanders
of
detachments
with
staffs
and
moving
according
to
rules
at
a
dis
tance
from
the
french
still
regarded
many
things
as
impossible
.
the
small
bands
that
had
started
their
activities
long
before
and
had
al
ready
observed
the
french
closely
considered
things
possible
which
the
commanders
of
the
big
detachments
did
not
dare
to
contemplate
.
the
cossacks
and
peasants
who
crept
in
among
the
french
now
considered
everything
possible
.
on
october
22
denisov
who
was
one
of
the
irregulars
was
with
his
group
at
the
height
of
the
guerrilla
enthusiasm
.
since
early
morn
ing
he
and
his
party
had
been
on
the
move
.
all
day
long
he
had
been
watching
from
the
forest
that
skirted
the
highroad
a
large
french
convoy
of
cavalry
baggage
and
russian
prison
ers
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
army
which
as
was
learned
from
spies
and
prisoners
was
moving
under
a
strong
escort
to
smolensk
.
be
sides
denisov
and
d61okhov
who
also
led
a
small
party
and
moved
in
denisovs
vicinity
the
commanders
of
some
large
divisions
with
staffs
also
knew
of
this
convoy
and
as
denfsov
expressed
it
were
sharpening
their
teeth
for
it
.
two
of
the
commanders
of
large
parties
one
a
pole
and
the
other
a
german
sent
in
vitations
to
denisov
almost
simultaneously
re
questing
him
to
join
up
with
their
divisions
to
attack
the
convoy
.
no
bwother
i
have
gwown
mustaches
my
self
said
denisov
on
reading
these
docu
ments
and
he
wrote
to
the
german
that
de
spite
his
heartfelt
desire
to
serve
under
so
val
591
iant
and
renowned
a
general
he
had
to
forgo
that
pleasure
because
he
was
already
under
the
command
of
the
polish
general
.
to
the
polish
general
he
replied
to
the
same
effect
inform
ing
him
that
he
was
already
under
the
com
mand
of
the
german
.
having
arranged
matters
thus
denfsov
and
d61okhov
intended
without
reporting
mat
ters
to
the
higher
command
to
attack
and
seize
that
convoy
with
their
own
small
forces
.
on
october
22
it
was
moving
from
the
village
of
mikiilino
to
that
of
shamshevo
.
to
the
left
of
the
road
between
mikulino
and
shdmshevo
there
were
large
forests
extending
in
some
places
up
to
the
road
itself
though
in
others
a
mile
or
more
back
from
it
.
through
these
forests
denfsov
and
his
party
rode
all
day
sometimes
keeping
well
back
in
them
and
sometimes
coming
to
the
very
edge
but
never
losing
sight
of
the
moving
french
.
that
morn
ing
cossacks
of
denisovs
party
had
seized
and
carried
off
into
the
forest
two
wagons
loaded
with
cavalry
saddles
which
had
stuck
in
the
mud
not
far
from
mikulino
where
the
forest
ran
close
to
the
road
.
since
then
and
until
evening
the
party
had
watched
the
move
ments
of
the
french
without
attacking
.
it
was
necessary
to
let
the
french
reach
shdmshevo
quietly
without
alarming
them
and
then
after
joining
dolokhov
who
was
to
come
that
eve
ning
to
a
consultation
at
a
watchmans
hut
in
the
forest
less
than
a
mile
from
shamshevo
to
surprise
the
french
at
dawn
falling
like
an
avalanche
on
their
heads
from
two
sides
and
rout
and
capture
them
all
at
one
blow
.
in
their
rear
more
than
a
mile
from
miku
lino
where
the
forest
came
right
up
to
the
road
six
cossacks
were
posted
to
report
if
any
fresh
columns
of
french
should
show
them
selves
.
beyond
shdmshevo
d61okhov
was
to
observe
the
road
in
the
same
way
to
find
out
at
what
distance
there
were
other
french
troops
.
they
reckoned
that
the
convoy
had
fifteen
hundred
men
.
denfsov
had
two
hundred
and
d61okhov
might
have
as
many
more
but
the
disparity
of
numbers
did
not
deter
denisov
.
all
that
he
now
wanted
to
know
was
what
troops
these
were
and
to
learn
that
he
had
to
capture
a
tongue
that
is
a
man
from
the
enemy
col
umn
.
that
mornings
attack
on
the
wagons
had
been
made
so
hastily
that
the
frenchmen
with
the
wagons
had
all
been
killed
only
a
little
drummer
boy
had
been
taken
alive
and
as
he
was
a
straggler
he
could
tell
them
noth
ing
definite
about
the
troops
in
that
column
.
59
war
and
peace
denisov
considered
it
dangerous
to
make
a
second
attack
for
fear
of
putting
the
whole
column
on
the
alert
so
he
sent
tikhon
shcher
baty
a
peasant
of
his
party
to
shdmshevo
to
try
and
seize
at
least
one
of
the
french
quarter
masters
who
had
been
sent
on
in
advance
.
chapter
iv
it
was
a
warm
rainy
autumn
day
.
the
sky
and
the
horizon
were
both
the
color
of
muddy
water
.
at
times
a
sort
of
mist
descended
and
then
suddenly
heavy
slanting
rain
came
down
.
denisov
in
a
felt
cloak
and
a
sheepskin
cap
from
which
the
rain
ran
down
was
riding
a
thin
thoroughbred
horse
with
sunken
sides
.
like
his
horse
which
turned
its
head
and
laid
its
ears
back
he
shrank
from
the
driving
rain
and
gazed
anxiously
before
him
.
his
thin
face
with
its
short
thick
black
beard
looked
angry
.
beside
denisov
rode
an
esaul
1
denfsovs
fellow
worker
also
in
felt
cloak
and
sheepskin
cap
and
riding
a
large
sleek
don
horse
.
esaul
lovdyski
the
third
was
a
tall
man
as
straight
as
an
arrow
palefaced
fairhaired
with
narrow
light
eyes
and
with
calm
selfsatis
faction
in
his
face
and
bearing
.
though
it
was
impossible
to
say
in
what
the
peculiarity
of
the
horse
and
rider
lay
yet
at
first
glance
at
the
esaul
and
denfsov
one
saw
that
the
latter
was
wet
and
uncomfortable
and
was
a
man
mounted
on
a
horse
while
looking
at
the
esaul
one
saw
that
he
was
as
comfortable
and
as
much
at
ease
as
always
and
that
he
was
not
a
man
who
had
mounted
a
horse
but
a
man
who
was
one
with
his
horse
a
being
consequently
possessed
of
twofold
strength
.
a
little
ahead
of
them
walked
a
peasant
guide
wet
to
the
skin
and
wearing
a
gray
peasant
coat
and
a
white
knitted
cap
.
a
little
behind
on
a
poor
small
lean
kirg
hiz
mount
with
an
enormous
tail
and
mane
and
a
bleeding
mouth
rode
a
young
officer
in
a
blue
french
overcoat
.
beside
him
rode
an
hussar
with
a
boy
in
a
tattered
french
uniform
and
blue
cap
behind
him
on
the
crupper
of
his
horse
.
the
boy
held
on
to
the
hussar
with
cold
red
hands
and
rais
ing
his
eyebrows
gazed
about
him
with
sur
prise
.
this
was
the
french
drummer
boy
cap
tured
that
morning
.
behind
them
along
the
narrow
sodden
cut
up
forest
road
came
hussars
in
threes
and
fours
and
then
cossacks
some
in
felt
cloaks
some
in
french
greatcoats
and
some
with
horse
cloths
over
their
heads
.
the
horses
being
1
a
captain
of
cossacks
.
drenched
by
the
rain
all
looked
black
whether
chestnut
or
bay
.
their
necks
with
their
wet
closeclinging
manes
looked
strangely
thin
.
steam
rose
from
them
.
clothes
saddles
reins
were
all
wet
slippery
and
sodden
like
the
ground
and
the
fallen
leaves
that
strewed
the
road
.
the
men
sat
huddled
up
trying
not
to
stir
so
as
to
warm
the
water
that
had
trickled
to
their
bodies
and
not
admit
the
fresh
cold
water
that
was
leaking
in
under
their
seats
their
knees
and
at
the
back
of
their
necks
.
in
the
midst
of
the
outspread
line
of
cossacks
two
wagons
drawn
by
french
horses
and
by
saddled
cossack
horses
that
had
been
hitched
on
in
front
rumbled
over
the
tree
stumps
and
branches
and
splashed
through
the
water
that
lay
in
the
ruts
.
denisovs
horse
swerved
aside
to
avoid
a
pool
in
the
track
and
bumped
his
riders
knee
against
a
tree
.
oh
the
devil
exclaimed
denisov
angrily
and
showing
his
teeth
he
struck
his
horse
three
times
with
his
whip
splashing
himself
and
his
comrades
with
mud
.
denisov
was
out
of
sorts
both
because
of
the
rain
and
also
from
hunger
none
of
them
had
eaten
anything
since
morning
and
yet
more
because
he
still
had
no
news
from
d61okhov
and
the
man
sent
to
capture
a
tongue
had
not
returned
.
therell
hardly
be
another
such
chance
to
fall
on
a
transport
as
today
.
its
too
risky
to
at
tack
them
by
oneself
and
if
we
put
it
off
till
an
other
day
one
of
the
big
guerrilla
detachments
will
snatch
the
prey
from
under
our
noses
thought
denisov
continually
peering
forward
hoping
to
see
a
messenger
from
d61okhov
.
on
coming
to
a
path
in
the
forest
along
which
he
could
see
far
to
the
right
denisov
stopped
.
theres
someone
coming
said
he
.
the
esaul
looked
in
the
direction
denfsov
indicated
.
there
are
two
an
officer
and
a
cossack
.
but
it
is
not
presupposable
that
it
is
the
lieutenant
colonel
himself
said
the
esaul
who
was
fond
of
using
words
the
cossacks
did
not
know
.
the
approaching
riders
having
descended
a
decline
were
no
longer
visible
but
they
re
appeared
a
few
minutes
later
.
in
front
at
a
weary
gallop
and
using
his
leather
whip
rode
an
officer
disheveled
and
drenched
whose
trousers
had
worked
up
to
above
his
knees
.
be
hind
him
standing
in
the
stirrups
trotted
a
cossack
.
the
officer
a
very
young
lad
with
a
broad
rosy
face
and
keen
merry
eyes
galloped
book
fourteen
up
to
denisov
and
handed
him
a
sodden
en
593
velope
.
from
the
general
said
the
officer
.
please
excuse
its
not
being
quite
dry
.
denfsov
frowning
took
the
envelope
and
opened
it
.
there
they
kept
telling
us
its
dangerous
its
dangerous

said
the
officer
addressing
the
esaul
while
denfsov
was
reading
the

we
have
each
of

two

but

he
asked
noticing
the
french
drummer
boy
.
a

exclaimed
denisov
hav
ing
run
through
the
dispatch
.
why
didnt
you
say
who
you
were
and
turning
with
a
smile
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
lad
.
the
officer
was
pe
tya
rost6v
.
all
the
way
ptya
had
been
preparing
him
self
to
behave
with
denisov
as
befitted
a
grown
up
man
and
an
officer
without
hinting
at
their
previous
acquaintance
.
but
as
soon
as
denfsov
smiled
at
him
petya
brightened
up
blushed
with
pleasure
forgot
the
official
man
ner
he
had
been
rehearsing
and
began
telling
him
how
he
had
already
been
in
a
battle
near
vydzma
and
how
a
certain
hussar
had
distin
guished
himself
there
.
well
i
am
glad
to
see
you
denisov
inter
rupted
him
and
his
face
again
assumed
its
anxious
expression
.
michael
feoklftych
said
he
to
the
esaul
this
is
again
fwom
that
german
you
know
.
he
he
indicated
pdtya
is
serving
under
him
.
and
denisov
told
the
esaul
that
the
dis
patch
just
delivered
was
a
repetition
of
the
ger
man
generals
demand
that
he
should
join
forces
with
him
for
an
attack
on
the
transport
.
if
we
dont
take
it
tomowwow
hell
snatch
it
fwom
under
our
noses
he
added
.
while
denisov
was
talking
to
the
esaul
pdtya
abashed
by
denisovs
cold
tone
and
supposing
that
it
was
due
to
the
condition
of
his
trousers
furtively
tried
to
pull
them
down
under
his
greatcoat
so
that
no
one
should
no
tice
it
while
maintaining
as
martial
an
air
as
possible
.
will
there
be
any
orders
your
honor
he
asked
denfsov
holding
his
hand
at
the
salute
and
resuming
the
game
of
adjutant
and
gen
eral
for
which
he
had
prepared
himself
or
shall
i
remain
with
your
honor
orders
denfsov
repeated
thoughtfully
.
but
can
you
stay
till
tomowwow
oh
please

.

.

.
may
i
stay
with
you
cried
but
just
what
did
the
genewal
tell
you
to
weturn
at
once
asked
denfsov
.
pkya
blushed
.
he
gave
me
no
instructions
.
i
think
i
could
he
returned
inquiringly
.
well
all
wight
said
denfsov
.
and
turning
to
his
men
he
directed
a
party
to
go
on
to
the
halting
place
arranged
near
the
watchmans
hut
in
the
forest
and
told
the
officer
on
the
kirghiz
horse
who
performed
the
duties
of
an
adjutant
to
go
and
find
out
where
d61okhov
was
and
whether
he
would
come
that
evening
.
denisov
himself
intended
going
with
the
esaul
and
phya
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
where
it
reached
out
to
shamshevo
to
have
a
look
at
the
part
of
the
french
biv
ouac
they
were
to
attack
next
day
.
well

said
he
to
the

to

.
denisov
pehya
and
the
esaul
accompanied
by
some
cossacks
and
the
hussar
who
had
the
prisoner
rode
to
the
left
across
a
ravine
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
.
chapter
v
the
rain
had
stopped
and
only
the
mist
was
falling
and
drops
from
the
trees
.
denisov
the
esaul
and
pckya
rode
silently
following
the
peasant
in
the
knitted
cap
who
stepping
lightly
with
outturned
toes
and
moving
noise
lessly
in
his
bast
shoes
over
the
roots
and
wet
leaves
silently
led
them
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
.
he
ascended
an
incline
stopped
looked
about
him
and
advanced
to
where
the
screen
of
trees
was
less
dense
.
on
reaching
a
large
oak
tree
that
had
not
yet
shed
its
leaves
he
stopped
and
beckoned
mysteriously
to
them
with
his
hand
.
denisov
and
pckya
rode
up
to
him
.
from
the
spot
where
the
peasant
was
standing
they
could
see
the
french
.
immediately
beyond
the
forest
on
a
downward
slope
lay
a
field
of
spring
rye
.
to
the
right
beyond
a
steep
ravine
was
a
small
village
and
a
landowners
house
with
a
broken
roof
.
in
the
village
in
the
house
in
the
garden
by
the
well
by
the
pond
over
all
the
rising
ground
and
all
along
the
road
uphill
from
the
bridge
leading
to
the
village
not
more
than
five
hundred
yards
away
crowds
of
men
could
be
seen
through
the
shimmering
mist
.
their
unrussian
shouting
at
their
horses
which
were
straining
uphill
with
the
carts
and

their
calls
to
one
another
could
be
clearly
heard
.
bwing
the
prisoner
here
said
denfsov
in
a
low
voice
not
taking
his
eyes
off
the
french
.
a
cossack
dismounted
lifted
the
boy
down
and
took
him
to
denfsov
.
pointing
to
the
french
troops
denisov
asked
him
what
these
and
those
of
them
were
.
the
boy
thrusting
his
cold
hands
into
his
pockets
and
lifting
his
eye
brows
looked
at
denisov
in
affright
but
in
spite
of
an
evident
desire
to
say
all
he
knew
gave
confused
answers
merely
assenting
to
everything
denfsov
asked
him
.
denfsov
turned
away
from
him
frowning
and
addressed
the
esaul
conveying
his
own
conjectures
to
him
.
pkya
rapidly
turning
his
head
looked
now
at
the
drummer
boy
now
at
denisov
now
at
the
esaul
and
now
at
the
french
in
the
village
and
along
the
road
trying
not
to
miss
any
thing
of
importance
.
whether
dolokhov
comes
or
not
we
must
seize
it
eh
said
denfsov
with
a
merry
sparkle
in
his
eyes
.
it
is
a
very
suitable
spot
said
the
esaul
.
well

the
iniantwy

by

swamps
denisov
continued
.
theyll
cweep
up
to

with

he
pointed
to
a
spot
in
the
forest
beyond
the
village

fwom

.
and
at
the
signal
shot

.

the
hollow

said
the
esaul
.
the
horses
would
sink
.
we
must
ride
round
more
to
the
left
.

.

.

.
while
they
were
talking
in
undertones
the
crack
of
a
shot
sounded
from
the
low
ground
by
the
pond
a
puff
of
white
smoke
appeared
then
another
and
the
sound
of
hundreds
of
seemingly
merry
french
voices
shouting
to
gether
came
up
from
the
slope
.
for
a
moment
denfsov
and
the
esaul
drew
back
.
they
were
so
near
that
they
thought
they
were
the
cause
of
the
firing
and
shouting
.
but
the
firing
and
shouting
did
not
relate
to
them
.
down
below
a
man
wearing
something
red
was
running
through
the
marsh
.
the
french
were
evidently
firing
and
shouting
at
him
.
why
thats
our
tfkhon
said
the
esaul
.
so
it
is
it
is
the
wascall
said
denfsov
.
hell
get
away
said
the
esaul
screwing
up
his
eyes
.
the
man
whom
they
called
tfkhon
having
run
to
the
stream
plunged
in
so
that
the
water
splashed
in
the
air
and
having
disappeared
for
an
instant
scrambled
out
on
all
fours
all
black
with
the
wet
and
ran
on
.

had

said
the
esaul
.
what

denfsov
with

former
look
of
vexation

he
been
doing
all
this

sent
him
to
capture
a
tongue
.

oh
yes
said
ptya
nodding
at
the
first
words
denfsov
uttered
as
if
he
understood
it
all
though
he
really
did
not
understand
any
thing
of
it
.
tfkhon
shcherbdty
was
one
of
the
most
in
dispensable
men
in
their
band
.
he
was
a
peas
ant
from
pokr6vsk
near
theriver
gzhat
.
when
denfsov
had
come
to
pokr6vsk
at
the
begin
ning
of
his
operations
and
had
as
usual
sum
moned
the
village
elder
and
asked
him
what
he
knew
about
the
french
the
elder
as
though
shielding
himself
had
replied
as
all
village
elders
did
that
he
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
of
them
.
but
when
denfsov
explained
that
his
purpose
was
to
kill
the
french
and
asked
if
no
french
had
strayed
that
way
the
elder
replied
that
some
moreorderers
had
really
been
at
their
village
but
that
tfkhon
shcherbaty
was
the
only
man
who
dealt
with
such
matters
.
denfsov
had
tfkhon
called
and
having
praised
him
for
his
activity
said
a
few
words
in
the
elders
presence
about
loyalty
to
the
tsar
and
the
country
and
the
hatred
of
the
french
that
all
sons
of
the
fatherland
should
cherish
.
we
dont
do
the
french
any
harm
said
tfkhon
evidently
frightened
by
denfsovs
words
.
we
only
fooled
about
with
the
lads
for
fun
you
know
we
killed
a
score
or
so
of
moreorderers
but
we
did
no
harm
else
.

.

.

.
next
day
when
denfsov
had
left
pokr6vsk
having
quite
forgotten
about
this
peasant
it
was
reported
to
him
that
tfkhon
had
attached
himself
to
their
party
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
remain
with
it
.
denfsov
gave
orders
to
let
him
do
so
.
tfkhon
who
at
first
did
rough
work
laying
campfires
fetching
water
flaying
dead
horses
and
so
on
soon
showed
a
great
liking
and
aptitude
for
partisan
warfare
.
at
night
he
would
go
out
for
booty
and
always
brought
back
french
clothing
and
weapons
and
when
told
to
would
bring
in
french
captives
also
.
denfsov
then
relieved
him
from
drudgery
and
began
taking
him
with
him
when
he
went
out
on
expeditions
and
had
him
enrolled
among
the
cossacks
.

tfkhon
did
not
like
riding
and
always
went
on

never
lagging
behind
the
cavalry
.
he
was
armed
with
a
musketoon
which
he
car
ried
rather
as
a
joke
a
pike
and
an
ax
which
latter
he
used
as
a
wolf
uses
its
teeth
with
equal
ease
picking
fleas
out
of
its
fur
or
crunching
thick
bones

with

at

or

the

would
cut

little
pegs
or
carve

.
in
denfsovs
party
he
held
a
peculiar
and
exceptional
position
.
when
anything
particularly
difficult
or
nasty
had
to
be
done
to
push
a
cart
out
of
the
mud

in

every
body
pointed
laughingly
at
tikhon
.
it
wont
hurt
that
devil
hes
as
strong
as
a
horse
they
said
of
him
.
once
a
frenchman
tikhon
was
trying
to
capture
fired
a
pistol
at
him
and
shot
him
in
the
fleshy
part
of
the
back
.
that
wound
which
tfkhon
treated
only
with
internal
and
exter
nal
applications
of
vodka
was
the
subject
of
the
liveliest
jokes
by
the
whole
detachment
jokes
in
which
tfkhon
readily
joined
.
hallo
matel
never
again
gave
you
a
twist
the
cossacks
would
banter
him
.
and
tfkhon
purposely
writhing
and
making
faces
pretended
to
be
angry
and
swore
at
the
french
with
the
funniest
curses
.
the
only
effect
of
this
incident
on
tfkhon
was
that
after
being
wounded
he
seldom
brought
in
prisoners
.
he
was
the
bravest
and
most
useful
man
in
the
party
.
no
one
found
more
opportunities
for
attacking
no
one
captured
or
killed
more
frenchmen
and
consequently
he
was
made
the
buffoon
of
all
the
cossacks
and
hussars
and
willingly
accepted
that
role
.
now
he
had
been
sent
by
denfsov
overnight
to
shamshevo
to
capture
a
tongue
.
but
whether
because
he
had
not
been
content
to
take
only
one
french
man
or
because
he
had
slept
through
the
night
he
had
crept
by
day
into
some
bushes
right
among
the
french
and
as
denfsov
had
wit
nessed
from
above
had
been
detected
by
them
.

after
talking
for
some
time
with
the
esaul
about
next

which
now
seeing
how
near
they
were
to
the
french
he
seemed
to
have
definitely
decided
on

turned
his
horse
and
rode
back
.
now
my

well
go
and
get
dwy
he
said
to
p6tya
.
as
they
approached
the
watchhouse
denfsov
stopped
peering
into
the
forest
.
among
the
trees
a
man
with
long
legs
and
long
swinging
arms
wearing
a
short
jacket
bast
shoes
and
a
kazan
hat
was
approaching
with
long
light
steps
.
he
had
a
musketoon
over
his
shoulder
and
an
ax
stuck
in
his
girdle
.
when
he
espied
denfsov
he
hastily
threw
something
into
the
bushes
removed
his
sodden
hat
by
its
floppy
brim
and
approached
his
commander
.
it
was
tfkhon
.
his
wrinkled
and
pockmarked
face
and
narrow
little
eyes
beamed
with
selfsatisfied
merriment
.
he
lifted
his
head
high
and
gazed
at
denfsov
as
if
repressing
a
laugh
.
well
where
did
you
disappear
to
in
quired
denfsov
.
where
did
i
disappear
to
i
went
to
get
frenchmen
answered
tikhon
boldly
and
hurriedly
in
a
husky
but
melodious
bass
voice
.
why

you
push
yourself
in
there
by
day
light

said
tfkhon
.

tfkhon
continued
spreading
out
his
flat
feet
with
outturned
toes
in
their
bast
shoes
.
i
took
him
into
the
forest
.
then
i
see
hes
no

and
think
ill

and

likelier

.

.

.

said
denisov
to
the
esaul
.
why
didnt

the
good
of

tfkhon
interrupted
hastily
and
angrily
that
one
wouldnt
have
done
for
you
.
as
if
i
dont
know
what
sort
you
want
what
a
bwute

.

.
well
i
went
for
another
one
tfkhon
con
tinued
and
i
creptlike
this
through
the
wood
and
lay
down
.
he
suddenly
lay
down
on
his
stomach
with
a
supple
movement
to
show
how
he
had
done
it
.
one
turned
up
and
i
grabbed
him
like
this
.
he
jumped
up
quickly
and
lightly
.

along
to
the
colonel

said
.
he
starts
yelling
and
suddenly
there
were
four
of
them
.
they
rushed
at
me
with
their
little
swords
.
so
i
went
for
them
with
my

tfkhon
waving
his

with
an
angry
scowl
and
throwing
out
his
chest
.

from
the

the
esaul
screwing
up
his
glittering
eyes

his

beaming

a

had
lost
a
tooth
that
was
why
he
was
called
shcherbaty
the
gaptoothed
.
denfsov
smiled
and
ptya
burst
into
a
peal
of
merry
laughter
in
which
tikhon
himself
joined
.
oh
but
he
was
a
regular
goodfornothing
said
tfkhon
.
the
clothes
on
him
poor
stuff
how
could
i
bring
him
and
so
rude
your
honor
why
he
says
im
a
generals
son
my
self
i
wont
go
he
says
.
you
are
a
bwute
said
denisov
.
i
wanted
to
question

.

.

.
but
i
questioned
him
said
tikhon
.
he
said
he
didnt
know
much
.
there

a
lot
of
us
he
says
but
all
poor
stuff
only
soldiers
in
name
he
says
.
shout
loud
at
them
he
says
and
youll
take
them
all

tikhon
concluded
looking
cheerfully
and
resolutely
into
deni
sovs
eyes
.
ill
give
you
ahundwedsharp
lashes
thatll
teach
you
to
play
the
fool
said
denisov
severely
.
but
why
are
you
angry
remonstrated
tfkhon
just
as
if
id
never
seen
your
french
men
only
wait
till
it
gets
dark
and
ill
fetch
you
any
of
them
you
want
three
if
you
like
.
well
lets
go
said
denisov
and
rode
all
the
way
to
the
watchhouse
in
silence
and
frowning
angrily
.
tikhon
followed
behind
and
ptya
heard
the
cossacks
laughing
with
him
and
at
him
about
some
pair
of
boots
he
had
thrown
into
the
bushes
.
when
the
fit
of
laughter
that
had
seized
him
at
tfkhons
words
and
smile
had
passed
and
ptya
realized
for
a
moment
that
this
tfkhon
had
killed
a
man
he
felt
uneasy
.
he
looked
round
at
the
captive
drummer
boy
and
felt
a
pang
in
his
heart
.
but
this
uneasiness
lasted
only
a
moment
.
he
felt
it
necessary
to
hold
his
head
higher
to
brace
himself
and
to
ques
tion
the
esaul
with
an
air
of
importance
about
tomorrows
undertaking
that
he
might
not
be
unworthy
of
the
company
in
which
he
found
himself
.
the
officer
who
had
been
sent
to
inquire
met
denfsov
on
the
way
with
the
news
that
d61okhov
was
soon
coming
and
that
all
was
well
with
him
.
denfsovat
once
cheered
upand
calling
ptya
to
him
said
well
tell
me
about
yourself
.
chapter
vii
ptya
having
left
his
people
after
their
de
parture
from
moscow
joined
his
regiment
and
was
soon
taken
as
orderly
by
a
general
com
manding
a
large
guerrilla
detachment
.
from
the
time
he
received
his
commission
and
espe
cially
since
he
had
joined
the
active
army
and
taken
part
in
the
battle
of
vyazma
petya
had
been
in
a
constant
state
of
blissful
excitement
at
being
grownup
and
in
a
perpetual
ecstatic
hurry
not
to
miss
any
chance
to
do
something
really
heroic
.
he
was
highly
delighted
with
what
he
saw
and
experienced
in
the
army
but
at
the
same
time
it
always
seemed
to
him
that
the
really
heroic
exploits
were
being
per
formed
just
where
he
did
not
happen
to
be
.
and
he
was
always
in
a
hurry
to
get
where
he
was
not
.
when
on
the
twentyfirst
of
october
his
gen
eral
expressed
a
wish
to
send
somebody
to
denisovs
detachment
ptya
begged
so
pite
ously
to
be
sent
that
the
general
could
not
re
fuse
.
but
when
dispatching
him
he
recalled
ptyas
mad
action
at
the
battle
of
vyazma
where
instead
of
riding
by
the
road
to
the
place
to
which
he
had
been
sent
he
had
galloped
to
the
advanced
line
under
the
fire
of
the
french
and
had
there
twice
fired
his
pistol
.
so
now
the
general
explicitly
forbade
his
taking
part
in
any
action
whatever
of
denfsovs
.
that
was
why
pchya
had
blushed
and
grown
confused
when
denfsov
asked
him
whether
he
could
stay
.
before
they
had
ridden
to
the
outskirts
of
the
forest
ptya
had
considered
that
he
must
carry
out
his
instructions
strictly
and
return
at
once
.
but
when
he
saw
the
french
and
saw
tikhon
and
learned
that
there
would
certainly
be
an
attack
that
night
he
decided
with
the
rapidity
with
which
young
people
change
their
views
that
the
general
whom
he
had
greatly
respected
till
then
was
a
rubbishy
german
that
denfsov
was
a
hero
the
esaul
a
hero
and
tfkhon
a
hero
too
and
that
it
would
be
shame
ful
for
him
to
leave
them
at
a
moment
of
dif
ficulty
.
it
was
already
growing
dusk
when
denfsov
ptya
and
the
esaul
rode
up
to
the
watchhouse
.
in
the
twilight
saddled
horses
could
be
seen
and
cossacks
and
hussars
who
had
rigged
up
rough
shelters
in
the
glade
and
were
kindling
glowing
fires
in
a
hollow
of
the
forest
where
book
fourteen
597
the
french
could
not
see
the
smoke
.
in
the
passage
of
the
small
watchhouse
a
cossack
with
sleeves
rolled
up
was
chopping
some
mutton
.
in
the
room
three
officers
of
denisovs
band
were
converting
a
door
into
a
tabletop
.
ptya
took
off
his
wet
clothes
gave
them
to
be
dried
and
at
once
began
helping
the
officers
to
fix
up
the
dinner
table
.
in
ten
minutes
the
table
was
ready
and
a
napkin
spread
on
it
.
on
the
table
were
vodka
a
flask
of
rum
white
bread
roast
mutton
and
salt
.
sitting
at
table
with
the
officers
and
tearing
the
fat
savory
mutton
with
his
hands
down
which
the
grease
trickled
ptya
was
in
an
ecstatic
childish
state
of
love
for
all
men
and
consequently
of
confidence
that
others
loved
him
in
the
same
way
.
so
then
what
do
you
think
vasfli
dmf
trich
said
he
to
denfsov
.
its
all
right
my
staying
a
day
with
you
and
not
waiting
for
a
reply
he
answered
his
own
question
you
see
i
was
told
to
find
out
well
i
am
finding
out
.

.

.

.
only
do
let
me
into
the
very

.

.

.
into
the
chief

..
.
i
dont
want
a
reward
.

.

.

.
but
i
want

.

.

.
ptya
clenched
his
teeth
and
looked
around
throwing
back
his
head
and
flourishing
his
arms
.
into
the
vewy
chief

.

.

.
denisov
repeated
with
a
smile
.
only
please
let
me
command
something
so
that
i
may
really
command

.

.

.
ptya
went
on
.
what
would
it
be
to
you

.

.

.
oh
you
want
a
knife
he
said
turning
to
an
officer
who
wished
to
cut
himself
a
piece
of
mutton
.
and
he
handed
him
his
clasp
knife
.
the
officer
admired
it
.
please
keep
it
.
i
have
several
like
it
said
ptya
blushing
.
heavens
i
was
quite
for
getting
he
suddenly
cried
.
i
have
some
rai
sins
fine
ones
you
know
seedless
ones
.
we
have
a
new
sutler
and
he
has
such
capital
things
.
i
bought
ten
pounds
.
i
am
used
to
something
sweet
.
would
you
like
some

.

.

.
and
ptya
ran
out
into
the
passage
to
his
cos
sack
and
brought
back
some
bags
which
con
tained
about
five
pounds
of
raisins
.
have
some
gentlemen
have
some
you
want
a
coffeepot
dont
you
he
asked
the
esaul
i
bought
a
capital
one
from
our
sutler
he
has
splendid
things
.
and
hes
very
honest
thats
the
chief
thing
.
ill
be
sure
to
send
it
to
you
.
or
perhaps
your
flints
are
giv
ing
out
or
are
worn
out
that
happens
some
times
you
know
.
i
have
brought
some
with
me
here
they
are
and
he
showed
a
bag
a
hundred
flints
.
i
bought
them
very
cheap
.
please
take
as
many
as
you
want
or
all
if
you
like

then
suddenly
dismayed
lest
he
had
said
too
much
ptya
stopped
and
blushed
.
he
tried
to
remember
whether
he
had
not
done
anything
else
that
was
foolish
.
and
run
ning
over
the
events
of
the
day
he
remembered
the
french
drummer
boy
.
its
capital
for
us
here
but
what
of
him
where
have
they
put
him
have
they
fed
him
havent
they
hurt
his
feelings
he
thought
.
but
having
caught
himself
saying
too
much
about
the
flints
he
was
now
afraid
to
speak
out
.
i
might
ask
he
thought
but
theyll
say
hes
a
boy
himself
and
so
he
pities
the
boy
.
ill
show
them
tomorrow
whether
im
a
boy
.
will
it
seem
odd
if
i
ask
ptya
thought
.
well
never
mind
and
immediately
blush
ing
and
looking
anxiously
at
the
officers
to
see
if
they
appeared
ironical
he
said
may
i
call
in
that
boy
who
was
taken
pris
oner
and
give
him
something
to
eat

.

.

.
per
haps

.

.

.
yes
hes
a
poor
little
fellow
said
denisov
who
evidently
saw
nothing
shameful
in
this
reminder
.
call
him
in
.
his
name
is
vincent
bosse
.
have
him
fetched
.
ill
call
him
said
pekya
.
yes
yes
call
him
.
a
poor
little
fellow

denisov
repeated
.
ptya
was
standing
at
the
door
when
denisov
said
this
.
he
slipped
in
between
the
officers
came
close
to
denisov
and
said
let
me
kiss
you
dear
old
fellow
oh
how
fine
how
splendid
and
having
kissed
denfsov
he
ran
out
of
the
hut
.
bosse
vincent
ptya
cried
stopping
out
side
the
door
.
who
do
you
want
sir
asked
a
voice
in
the
darkness
.
ptya
replied
that
he
wanted
the
french
lad
who
had
been
captured
that
day
.
ah
vesnny
said
a
cossack
.
vincent
the
boys
name
had
already
been
changed
by
the
cossacks
into
vestnny
vernal
and
into
vestnya
by
the
peasants
and
soldiers
.
in
both
these
adaptations
the
reference
to
spring
vesnd
matched
the
impression
made
by
the
young
lad
.
he
is
warming
himself
there
by
the
bon
fire
.
ho

and

hes
a
smart
lad
said
an
hussar
standing
near
ptya
.
we
gave
him
something
to
eat
a
while
ago
.
he
was
awfully
hungry
the
sound
of
bare
feet
splashing
through
the
mud
was
heard
in
the
darkness
and
the
drummer
boy
came
to
the
door
.
ah
cest
vous
said
phya
.
voulezvous

nayez
pas

he
added
shyly
and
affectionately
touching
the
boys
hand
.
entrez

said
the
drummer
boy
in
a
trembling
almost
childish
voice
and
he
began
scraping
his
dirty
feet
on
the
threshold
.
there
were
many
things
petya
wanted
to
say
to
the
drummer
boy
but
did
not
dare
to
.
he
stood
irresolutely
beside
him
in
the
pas
sage
.
then
in
the
darkness
he
took
the
boys
hand
and
pressed
it
.
come
in
come
in
he
repeated
in
a
gentle
whisper
.
oh
what
can
i
do
for
him
he
thought
and
opening
the
door
he
let
the
boy
pass
in
first
.
when
the
boy
had
entered
the
hut
pdtya
sat
down
at
a
distance
from
him
considering
it
beneath
his
dignity
to
pay
attention
to
him
.
but
he
fingered
the
money
in
his
pocket
and
wondered
whether
it
would
seem
ridiculous
to
give
some
to
the
drummer
boy
.
chapter
viii
the
arrival
of
d6lokhov
diverted
ptyas
at
tention
from
the
drummer
boy
to
whom
denf
sov
had
had
some
mutton
and
vodka
given
and
whom
he
had
had
dressed
in
a
russian
coat
so
that
he
might
be
kept
with
their
band
and
not
sent
away
with
the
other
prisoners
.
petya
had
heard
in
the
army
many
stories
of
d61okhovs
extraordinary
bravery
and
of
his
cruelty
to
the
french
so
from
the
moment
he
entered
the
hut
petya
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
him
but
braced
himself
up
more
and
more
and
held
his
head
high
that
he
might
not
be
unworthy
even
of
such
company
.
d61okhovs
appearance
amazed
ptya
by
its
simplicity
.
denisov
wore
a
cossack
coat
had
a
beard
had
an
icon
of
nicholas
the
wonder
worker
on
his
breast
and
his
way
of
speaking
and
everything
he
did
indicated
his
unusual
posi
tion
.
but
dolokhov
who
in
moscow
had
worn
a
persian
costume
had
now
the
appearance
of
a
most
correct
officer
of
the
guards
.

with
an
order
of

george
at
his
button
hole
and
a
plain
forage
cap
set
straight
on
his
head
.
he
took
off
his
wet
felt
cloak
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
without
greeting
anyone
went
up
to
denfsov
and
began
questioning
him
about
the
matter
in
hand
.
denisov
told
him
of
the
designs
the
large
detachments
had
on
the
transport
of
the
message
ptya
had
brought
and
his
own
replies
to
both
generals
.
then
he
told
him
all
he
knew
of
the
french
detach
ment
.
thats
so
.
but
we
must
know
what
troops
they
are
and
their
numbers
said
d61okhov
.
it
will
be
necessary
to
go
there
.
we
cant
start
the
affair
without
knowing
for
certain
how
many
of
them
there
are
.
i
like
to
work
accu
rately
.
here
now
wouldnt
one
of
these
gen
tlemen
like
to
ride
over
to
the
french
camp
with
me
i
have
brought
a
spare
uniform
.
i
i

..
.
ill
go
with
you
cried
pckya
.
theres
no
need
for
you
to
go
at
all
said
denisov
addressing
d61okhov
and
as
for
him
i
wont
let
him
go
on
any
account
.
i
like
that
exclaimed
ptya
.
why
shouldnt
i
go
because
its
useless
.
well
you
must
excuse
me
because

.

.

.
be
cause

..
.
i
shall
go
and
thats
all
.
youll
take
me
wont
you
he
said
turning
to
dolokhov
.
why
not
d61okhov
answered
absently
scrutinizing
the
face
of
the
french
drummer
boy
.
have
you
had
that
youngster
with
you
long
he
asked
denisov
.
he
was
taken
today
but
he
knows
nothing
.
im
keeping
him
with
me
.
yes
and
where
do
you
put
the
others
inquired
dolokhov
.
where
i
send
them
away
and
take
a
we
ceipt
for
them
shouted
denisov
suddenly
flushing
.
and
i
say
boldly
that
i
have
not
a
single
mans
life
on
my
conscience
.
would
it
be
difficult
for
you
to
send
thirty
or
thwee
hun
dwed
men
to
town
under
escort
instead
of
staining
i
speak
bluntly
staining
the
honor
of
a
soldier
that
kind
of
amiable
talk
would
be
suit
able
from
this
young
count
of
sixteen
said
d61okhov
with
cold
irony
but
its
time
for
you
to
drop
it
.
why
ive
not
said
anything
i
only
say
that
ill
certainly
go
with
you
said
ptya
shyly
.
but
for
you
and
me
old
fellow
its
time
to
drop
these
amenities
continued
d61okhov
as
if
he
found
particular
pleasure
in
speaking
book
fourteen
of
this
subject
which
irritated
denfsov
.
now
why
have
you
kept
this
lad
he
went
on
sway
ing
his
head
.
because
you
are
sorry
for
him
dont
we
know
those
receipts
of
yours
you
send
a
hundred
men
away
and
thirty
get
there
.
the
rest
either
starve
or
get
killed
.
so
isnt
it
all
the
same
not
to
send
them
the
esaul
screwing
up
his
lightcolored
eyes
nodded

thats
not
the
point
.
im
not
going
to
dis
cuss
the
matter
.
i
do
not
wish
to
take
it
on
my
conscience
.
you
say
theyll
die
.
all
wight
.
only
not
by
my
fault
d61okhov
began
laughing
.
who
has
told
them
not
to
capture
me
these
twenty
times
over
but
if
they
did
catch
me
theyd
string
me
up
to
an
aspen
tree
and
you
with
all
your
chivalry
just
the
same
.
he
paused
.
however
we
must
get
to
work
.
tell
the
cossack
to
fetch
my
kit
.
i
have
two
french
uniforms
in
it
.
well
are
you
coming
with
me
he
asked
pkya
.
i
yes
yes
certainly
cried
ptya
blush
ing
almost
to
tears
and
glancing
at
denfsov
.
while
d61okhov
had
been
disputing
with
denfsov
what
should
be
done
with
prisoners
ptftya
had
once
more
felt
awkward
and
restless
but
again
he
had
no
time
to
grasp
fully
what
they
were
talking
about
.
if
grownup
dis
tinguished
men
think
so
it
must
be
necessary
and
right
thought
he
.
but
above
all
denfsov
must
not
dare
to
imagine
that
ill
obey
him
and
that
he
can
order
me
about
.
i
will
certainly
go
to
the
french
camp
with
d61okhov
.
if
he
can
so
can
i
and
to
all
denisovs
persuasions
pchya
re
plied
that
he
too
was
accustomed
to
do
every
thing
accurately
and
not
just
anyhow
and
that
he
never
considered
personal
danger
.
for
youll
admit
that
if
we
dont
know
for
sure
how
many
of
them
there
are

.

.

.
hundreds
of
lives
may
depend
on
it
while
there
are
only
two
of
us
.
besides
i
want
to
go
very
much
and
certainly
will
go
so
dont
hinder
me
said
he
.
it
will
only
make
things
worse

ptya

d61okhov
rode
to
the
clearing
from
which
denfsov
had
reconnoitered
the
french
camp
and
emerging
from
the
forest
in
pitch
darkness
they
descended
into
the
hollow
.
on
reaching
the
bottom
d61okhov
told
the
cos
sacks
accompanying
him
to
await
him
there
and
rode
on
at
a
quick
trot
along
the
road
to
the

ptya
his

in

with

in

at
that
very
moment
they
heard
through

the
challenge

and
the
click
of
a

the

rushed
to
pchyas

cried
dolokhov
suddenly
flaring
up
and
riding
straight
at
the
sentinel
.

.

and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
from
the
sentinel
who
had
stepped
aside
d61okhov
rode
up
the
incline
at
a
walk
.
noticing
the
black
outline
of
a
man
crossing
the
road
d61okhov
stopped
him
and
inquired
where
the
commander
and
officers
were
.
the
man
a
soldier
with
a
sack
over
his
shoulder
stopped
came
close
up
to
dolokhovs
horse
touched
it
with
his
hand
and
explained
sim
ply
and
in
a
friendly
way
that
the
commander
and
the
officers
were
higher
up
the
hill
to
the
right
in
the
courtyard
of
the
farm
as
he
called
the
landowners
house
.
having
ridden
up
the
road
on
both
sides
of
which
french
talk
could
be
heard
around
the
campfires
d61okhov
turned
into
the
court
yard
of
the
landowners
house
.
having
ridden
in
he
dismounted
and
approached
a
big
blaz
ing
campfire
around
which
sat
several
men
talking
noisily
.
something
was
boiling
in
a
small
cauldron
at
the
edge
of
the
fire
and
a
soldier
in
a
peaked
cap
and
blue
overcoat
lit
up
by
the
fire
was
kneeling
beside
it
stirring
its
contents
with
a

6oo
war
and
peace
oh
hes
a
hard
nut
to
crack
said
one
of
the
officers
who
was
sitting
in
the
shadow
at
the
other
side
of
the
fire
.
hell
make
them
get
a
move
on
those
fel
lows
said
another
laughing
.
both
fell
silent
peering
out
through
the
darkness
at
the
sound
of
d61okhovs
and
ptyas
steps
as
they
advanced
to
the
fire
lead
ing
their
horses
.
bonjour
messieurs
j
said
dolokhov
loud
ly
and
clearly
.
there
was
a
stir
among
the
officers
in
the
shadow
beyond
the
fire
and
one
tall
long
necked
officer
walking
round
the
fire
came
up
to
d61okhov
.
is
that
you
cldment
he
asked
.
where
the
devil

.

.

.

but
noticing
his
mistake
he
broke
off
short
and
with
a
frown
greeted
dolokhov
as
a
stranger
asking
what
he
could
do
for
him
.
dolokhov
said
that
he
and
his
companion
were
trying
to
overtake
their
regiment
and
addressing
the
company
in
general
asked
whether
they
knew
anything
of
the
6th
regi
ment
.
none
of
them
knew
any
thing
and
ptya
thought
the
officers
were
beginning
to
look
at
him
and
d61okhov
with
hostility
and
suspi
cion
.
for
some
seconds
all
were
silent
.
if
you
were
counting
on
the
evening
soup
you
have
come
too
late
said
a
voice
from
be
hind
the
fire
with
a
repressed
laugh
.
dolokhov
replied
that
they
were
not
hungry
and
must
push
on
farther
that
night
.
he
handed
the
horses
over
to
the
soldier
who
was
stirring
the
pot
and
squatted
down
on
his
heels
by
the
fire
beside
the
officer
with
the
long
neck
.
that
officer
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
d61okhov
and
again
asked
to
what
regiment
he
belonged
.
d61okhov
as
if
he
had
not
heard
the
question
did
not
reply
but
lighting
a
short
french
pipe
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
began
asking
the
officer
in
how
far
the
road
before
them
was
safe
from
cossacks
.
those
brigands
are
everywhere
replied
an
officer
from
behind
the
fire
.
d61okhov
remarked
that
the
cossacks
were
a
danger
only
to
stragglers
such
as
his
compan
ion
and
himself
but
probably
they
would
not
dare
to
attack
large
detachments
he
added
inquiringly
.
no
one
replied
.
well
now
hell
come
away
ptya
thought
every
moment
as
he
stood
by
the
campfire
lis
tening
to
the
talk
.
but
d61okhov
restarted
the
conversation
good
day
gentlemen
which
had
dropped
and
began
putting
direct
questions
as
to
how
many
men
there
were
in
the
battalion
how
many
battalions
and
how
many
prisoners
.
asking
about
the
russian
prisoners
with
that
detachment
d61okhov
said
a
horrid
business
dragging
these
corpses
about
with
one
it
would
be
better
to
shoot
such
rabble
and
burst
into
loud
laughter
so
strange
that
ptya
thought
the
french
would
immediately
detect
their
disguise
and
invol
untarily
took
a
step
back
from
the
campfire
.
no
one
replied
a
word
to
d61okhovs
laugh
ter
and
a
french
officer
whom
they
could
not
see
he
lay
wrapped
in
a
greatcoat
rose
and
whispered
something
to
a
companion
.
d61ok
hov
got
up
and
called
to
the
soldier
who
was
holding
their
horses
.
will
they
bringour
horses
or
not
thought
ptya
instinctively
drawing
nearer
to
d61ok
hov
.
the
horses
were
brought
.
good
evening
gentlemen
said
d61okhov
.
pdtya
wished
to
say
good
night
but
could
not
utter
a
word
.
the
officers
were
whispering
together
.
d61okhov
was
a
long
time
mounting
his
horse
which
would
not
stand
still
then
he
rode
out
of
the
yard
at
a
footpace
.
ptya
rode
beside
him
longing
to
look
round
to
see
whether
or
no
the
french
were
running
after
them
but
not
daring
to
.
coming
out
onto
the
road
d61okhov
did
not
ride
back
across
the
open
country
but
through
the
village
.
at
one
spot
he
stopped
and
listened
.
do
you
hear
he
asked
.
ptya
recognized
the
sound
of
russian
voices
and
saw
the
dark
figures
of
russian
prisoners
round
their
campfires
.
when
they
had
descended
to
the
bridge
ptya
and
d61okhov
rode
past
the
sentinel
who
without
saying
a
word
paced
mo
rosely
up
and
down
it
then
they
descended
into
the
hollow
where
the
cossacks
awaited
them
.
well
now
goodby
.
tell
denfsov
at
the
first
shot
at
daybreak

said
d61okhov
and
was
about
to
ride
away
but
pchya
seized
hold
of
him
.
really
he
cried
you
are
such
a
hero
oh
how
fine
how
splendid
how
i
love
you
all
right
all
right
said
d61okhov
.
but
ptya
did
not
let
go
of
him
and
d61okhov
saw
through
the
gloom
that
ptya
was
bending
to
ward
him
and
wanted
to
kiss
him
.
d61okhov
kissed
him
laughed
turned
his
horse
and
van
ished
into
the
darkness

myself
if

and
then
i
am
used
to
not
sleep
ing
before
a
battle
.
he
sat
awhile
in
the
hut
joyfully
recalling
the
details
of
his
expedition
and
vividly
pic
turing
to
himself
what
would
happen
next
day
.
then
noticing
that
denisov
was
asleep
he
rose
and
went
out
of
doors
.
it
was
still
quite
dark
outside
.
the
rain
was
over
but
drops
were
still
falling
from
the
trees
.
near
the
watchmans
hut
the
black
shapes
of
the
cossacks
shanties
and
of
horses
tethered
to
gether
could
be
seen
.
behind
the
hut
the
dark
shapes
of
the
two
wagons
with
their
horses
be
side
them
were
discernible
and
in
the
hollow
the
dying
campfire
gleamed
red
.
not
all
the
cossacks
and
hussars
were
asleep
here
and
there
amid
the
sounds
of
falling
drops
and
the
munching
of
the
horses
near
by
could
be
heard
low
voices
which
seemed
to
be
whisper
ing
.
ptya
came
out
peered
into
the
darkness
and
went
up
to
the
wagons
.
someone
was
snor
ing
under
them
and
around
them
stood
sad
dled
horses
munching
their
oats
.
in
the
dark
ptya
recognized
his
own
horse
which
he
called
karabdkh

though
it
was
of
ukranian
breed
and
went
up
to
it
.
well
karabdkh
well
do
some
service
to
morrow
said
he
sniffing
its
nostrils
and
kiss
ing
it
.
why
arent
you
asleep
sir
said
a
cossack
who
was
sitting
under
a
wagon
.
no
ah

.

.

.
likhachev
isnt
that
your
name
do
you
know
i
have
only
just
come
back
weve
been
into
the
french
camp
.
and
pdtya
gave
the
cossack
a
detailed
ac
count
not
only
of
his
ride
but
also
of
his
object
and
why
he
considered
it
better
to
risk
his
life
than
to
act
just
anyhow
.

tr
.
well
you
should
get
some
sleep
now
said
the
cossack
.
no
i
am
used
to
this
said
ptya
.
i
say
arent
the
flints
in
your
pistols
worn
out
i
brought
some
with
me
.
dont
you
want
any
you
can
have
some
.
the
cossack
bent
forward
from
under
the
wagon
to
get
a
closer
look
at
pdtya
.
because
i
am
accustomed
to
doing
every
thing
accurately
said
ptya
.
some
fellows
do
things
just
anyhow
without
preparation
and
then
theyre
sorry
for
it
afterwards
.
i
dont
like
that
.
just
so
said
the
cossack
.
oh
yes
another
thing
please
my
dear
fellow
will
you
sharpen
my
saber
for
me
its
got
bl

.

.

.
pckya
feared
to
tell
a
lie
and
the
saber
never
had
been
sharpened
.
can
you
do
it
of
course
i
can
.
likhachev
got
up
rummaged
in
his
pack
and
soon
pdtya
heard
the
warlike
sound
of
steel
on
whetstone
.
he
climbed
onto
the
wagon
and
sat
on
its
edge
.
the
cossack
was
sharpen
ing
the
saber
under
the
wagon
.
i
say
are
the
lads
asleep
asked
ptya
.
some
are
and
some
arentlike
us
.
well
and
that
boy
vesenny
oh
hes
thrown
himself
down
there
in
the
passage
.
fast
asleep
after
his
fright
.
he
was
that
glad
after
that
ptya
remained
silent
for
a
long
time
listening
to
the
sounds
.
he
heard
foot
steps
in
the
darkness
and
a
black
figure
ap
peared
.
what
are
you
sharpening
asked
a
man
coming
up
to
the
wagon
.
why
this
gentlemans
saber
.
thats
right
said
the
man
whom
ptya
took
to
be
an
hussar
.
was
the
cup
left
here
there
by
the
wheel
the
hussar
took
the
cup
.
it
must
be
daylight
soon
said
he
yawn
ing
and
went
away
.
ptya
ought
to
have
known
that
he
was
in
a
forest
with
denfsovs
guerrilla
band
less
than
a
mile
from
the
road
sitting
on
a
wagon
captured
from
the
french
beside
which
horses
were
tethered
that
under
it
likhachev
was
sit
ting
sharpening
a
saber
for
him
that
the
big
dark
blotch
to
the
right
was
the
watchmans
hut
and
the
red
blotch
below
to
the
left
was
the
dying
embers
of
a
campfire
that
the
man
who
had
come
for
the
cup
was
an
hussar
who
wanted
a
drink
but
he
neither
knew
nor
wanted
to
know
anything
of
all
this
.
he
was
602
war
and
peace
in
a
fairy
kingdom
where
nothing
resembled
reality
.
the
big
dark
blotch
might
really
be
the
watchmans
hut
or
it
might
be
a
cavern
leading
to
the
very
depths
of
the
earth
.
per
haps
the
red
spot
was
a
fire
or
it
might
be
the
eye
of
an
enormous
monster
.
perhaps
he
was
really
sitting
on
a
wagon
but
it
might
very
well
be
that
he
was
not
sitting
on
a
wagon
but
on
a
terribly
high
tower
from
which
if
he
fell
he
would
have
to
fall
for
a
whole
day
or
a
whole
month
or
go
on
falling
and
never
reach
the
bottom
.
perhaps
it
was
just
the
cos
sack
likhachev
who
was
sitting
under
the
wagon
but
it
might
be
the
kindest
bravest
most
wonderful
most
splendid
man
in
the
world
whom
no
one
knew
of
.
it
might
really
have
been
that
an
hussar
came
for
water
and
went
back
into
the
hollow
but
perhaps
he
had
simply
vanisheddisappeared
altogether
and
dissolved
into
nothingness
.
nothing
ptya
could
have
seen
now
would
have
surprised
him
.
he
was
in
a
fairy
kingdom
where
everything
was
possible
.
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
.
and
the
sky
was
a
fairy
realm
like
the
earth
.
it
was
clearing
and
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
clouds
were
swiftly
sailing
as
if
unveiling
the
stars
.
sometimes
it
looked
as
if
the
clouds
were
passing
and
a
clear
black
sky
appeared
.
sometimes
it
seemed
as
if
the
black
spaces
were
clouds
.
sometimes
the
sky
seemed
to
be
rising
high
high
over
head
and
then
it
seemed
to
sink
so
low
that
one
could
touch
it
with
ones
hand
.
ptyas
eyes
began
to
close
and
he
swayed
a
little
.
the
trees
were
dripping
.
quiet
talking
was
heard
.
the
horses
neighed
and
jostled
one
another

hissed
the
saber
against
the
whetstone
and
suddenly
ptya
heard
an
harmonious
orchestra
playing
some
unknown
sweetly
solemn
hymn
.
ptya
was
as
musical
as
natdsha
and
more
so
than
nicholas
but
had
never
learned
music
or
thought
about
it
and
so
the
melody
that
un
expectedly
came
to
his
mind
seemed
to
him
particularly
fresh
and
attractive
.
the
music
became
more
and
more
audible
.
the
melody
grew
and
passed
from
one
instrument
to
an
other
.
and
what
was
played
was
a
fugue
though
ptya
had
not
the
least
conception
of
what
a
fugue
is
.
each
instrument
now
re
sembling
a
violin
and
now
a
horn
but
better
and
clearer
than
violin
or
horn
played
its
own
part
and
before
it
had
finished
the
mel
ody
merged
with
another
instrument
that
be
gan
almost
the
same
air
and
then
with
a
third
and
a
fourth
and
they
all
blended
into
one
and
again
became
separate
and
again
blended
now
into
solemn
church
music
now
into
some
thing
dazzlingly
brilliant
and
triumphant
.
oh
why
that
was
in
a
dream
ptya
said
to
himself
as
he
lurched
forward
.
its
in
my
ears
.
but
perhaps
its
music
of
my
own
.
well
go
on
my
music
now

.

.

.
he
closed
his
eyes
and
from
all
sides
as
if
from
a
distance
sounds
fluttered
grew
into
harmonies
separated
blended
and
again
all
mingled
into
the
same
sweet
and
solemn
hymn
.
oh
this
is
delightful
as
much
as
i
like
and
as
i
like
said
ptya
to
himself
.
he
tried
to
conduct
that
enormous
orchestra
.
now
softly
softly
die
away
and
the
sounds
obeyed
him
.
now
fuller
more
joyful
.
still
more
and
more
joyful
and
from
an
un
known
depth
rose
increasingly
triumphant
sounds
.
now
voices
join
in
ordered
ptya
.
and
at
first
from
afar
he
heard
mens
voices
and
then
womens
.
the
voices
grew
in
har
monious
triumphant
strength
and
ptya
lis
tened
to
their
surpassing
beauty
in
awe
and
joy
.
with
a
solemn
triumphal
march
there
min
gled
a
song
the
drip
from
the
trees
and
the
hissing
of
the
saber

.

.

.
and
again
the
horses
jostled
one
another
and
neighed
not
disturbing
the
choir
but
joining
in
it
.
ptya
did
not
know
how
long
this
lasted
he
enjoyed
himself
all
the
time
wondered
at
his
enjoyment
and
regretted
that
there
was
no
one
to
share
it
.
he
was
awakened
by

he
exclaimed
.
the
horses
that
had
previously
been
in
visible
could
now
be
seen
to
their
very
tails
and
a
watery
light
showed
itself
through
the
bare
branches
.
ptya
shook
himself
jumped
up
took
a
ruble
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
likhachev
then
he
flourished
the
saber
tested
it
and
sheathed
it
.
the
cossacks
were
untying
their
horses

tightening

denisov

along

hundreds
of

through

gave

held
his

by
the
bridle
impatiently
awaiting
the

to

his
face
having
been
bathed
in
cold
water
was
all
aglow

were

his

by

made
as

to

ptya
leaped
quickly
into
the
saddle
uncon
scious
of
his
own
weight
and
turning
to
look
at
the
hussars
starting
in
the
darkness
behind

rode
up

denisov
seemed
to
have
forgotten
petyas
very
existence

he
turned
to
glance
at
him
.
i
ask

thing
of
you
he
said
sternly
to
obey
me
and
not
shove
youself
foward
any
where
.
he
did
not
say
another
word
to
ptya
but
rode
in
silence
all
the
way
.
when
they
had
come
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
it
was
noticeably
growing
light
over
the
field
.
denisov
talked
in
whispers
with
the
esaul
and
the
cossacks
rode
past
pkya
and
denisov
.
when
they
had
all
ridden
by
denisov
touched
his
horse
and
rode
down
the
hill
.
slipping
onto
their
haunches
and
sliding
the
horses
descended
with
their
riders
into
the
ravine
.
ptya
rode
beside
denf

the
pulsation
of
his
body
constantly
in
creasing
.
it
was
getting
lighter
and
lighter
but
the
mist
still
hid
distant
objects
.
having
reached
the
valley
denisov
looked
back
and
nodded
to
a
cossack
beside
him
.
the
signall
said
he
.
the
cossack
raised
his
arm
and
a
shot
rang
out
.
in
an
instant
the
tramp
of
horses
gallop
ing
forward
was
heard
shouts
came
from
vari
ous
sides
and
then
more
shots
.
at
the
first
sound
of
trampling
hoofs
and
shouting
ptya
lashed
his
horse
and
loosening
his
rein
galloped
forward
not
heeding
denisov
who
shouted
at
him
.
it
seemed
to
ptya
that
at
the
moment
the
shot
was
fired
it
suddenly
be
came
as
bright
as
noon
.
he
galloped
to
the
bridge
.
cossacks
were
galloping
along
the
road
in
front
of
him
.
on
the
bridge
he
collided
with
a
cossack
who
had
fallen
behind
but
he
gal
loped
on
.
in
front
of
him
soldiers
probably
frenchmen
were
running
from
right
to
left
across
the
road
.
one
of
them
fell
in
the
mud
under
his
horses
feet
.
cossacks
were
crowding
about
a
hut
busy
with
something
.
from
the
midst
of
that
crowd
terrible
screams
arose
.
pchya
galloped
up
and
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
the
pale
face
and
trembling
jaw
of
a
frenchman
clutching
the
handle
of
a
lance
that
had
been
aimed
at
him
.
hurrah

shouted
ptya
and
giving
rein
to
his
excited
horse
he
gal
loped
forward
along
the
village
street
.
he
could
hear
shooting
ahead
of
him
.
cos
sacks
hussars
and
ragged
russian
prisoners
who
had
come
running
from
both
sides
of
the
road
were
shouting
something
loudly
and
in
coherently
.
a
gallantlooking
frenchman
in
a
blue
overcoat
capless
and
with
a
frowning
red
face
had
been
defending
himself
against
the
hussars
.
when
ptya
galloped
up
the
frenchman
had
already
fallen
.
too
late
again
flashed
through
pdtyas
mind
and
he
galloped
on
to
the
place
from
which
the
rapid
firing
could
be
heard
.
the
shots
came
from
the
yard
of
the
landowners
house
he
had
visited
the
night
before
with
dolokhov
.
the
french
were
making
a
stand
there
behind
a
wattle
fence
in
a
garden
thickly
overgrown
with
bushes
and
were
firing
at
the
cossacks
who
crowded
at
the
gateway
.
through
the
smoke
as
he
approached
the
gate
pchya
saw
dolokhov
whose
face
was
of
a
palegreenish
tint
shouting
to
his
men
.

exclaimed
as
petya
rode
up
to
him
.

.
hurrahahah
shouted
ptya
and
without
pausing
a
moment
galloped
to
the
place
whence
came
the
sounds
of
firing
and
where
the
smoke
was
thickest
.
a
volley
was
heard
and
some
bullets
whistled
past
while
others
plashed
against
something
.
the
cossacks
and
d61okhov
galloped
after
ptya
into
the
gateway
of
the
courtyard
.
in
the
dense
wavering
smoke
some
of
the
french
threw
down
their
arms
and
ran
out
of
the
bushes
to
meet
the
cossacks
while
others
ran
down
the
hill
toward
the
pond
.
ptya
was
604
war
and
peace
galloping
along
the
courtyard
but
instead
of
holding
the
reins
he
waved
both
his
arms
about
rapidly
and
strangely
slipping
farther
and
farther
to
one
side
in
his
saddle
.
his
horse
having
galloped
up
to
a
campfire
that
was
smoldering
in
the
morning
light
stopped
suddenly
and
ptya
fell
heavily
on
to
the
wet
ground
.
the
cossacks
saw
that
his
arms
and
legs
jerked
rapidly
though
his
head
was
quite
motionless
.
a
bullet
had
pierced
his
skull
.
after
speaking
to
the
senior
french
officer
who
came
out
of
the
house
with
a
white
handkerchief
tied
to
his
sword
and
announced
that
they
surrendered

dismounted
and
went
up
to
ptya
who
lay
motionless
with
outstretched
arms
.
done
for
he
said
with
a
frown
and
went
to
the
gate
to
meet
denfsov
who
was
riding
toward
him
.

cried
denisov
recognizing
from
a
distance
the
unmistakably
lifeless
attitude
very
familiar
to
him
in
which
ptyas
body
was
lying
.
done

repeated
dolokhov
as
if
the
utterance
of
these
words
afforded
him

and
he
went
quickly
up
to
the
prisoners
who
were
surrounded
by
cossacks
who
had
hurried
up
.

them
he
called
out
to
denisov
.
denisov
did
not
reply
he
rode
up
to
ptya
dismounted
and
with
trembling
hands
turned
toward
himself
the
bloodstained

which
had

he
recalled
pdtyas

.
and
the
cossacks
looked
round
in
sur
prise
at
the
sound
like
the
yelp
of
a
dog
with
which
denfsov
turned
away
walked
to
the
wattle
fence
and
seized
hold
of
it
.
among
the
russian
prisoners
rescued
by
denfsov
and
dolokhov
was
pierre

during
the
whole
of

mos
cow
no
fresh
orders
had
been
issued
by
the
french
authorities
concerning
the
party
of
prisoners
among
whom
was
pierre

on
the
twentysecond
of
october
that
party
was
no
longer
with
the

and
baggage

with
which
it
had
left

half
the
wagons
laden
with
hardtack
that
had
traveled

stages
with
them
had
been
captured
by

the

half
had
gone
on
ahead

not

of
those
dismounted

who
had
marched
in

had

from
vyazma
onwards
the
french
army
which
had
till
then
moved
in
three
columns
went
on
as
a
single
group
.
the
symptoms
of
disorder
that
pierre
had
noticed
at
their
first
halting
place
after
leaving
moscow
had
now
reached
the
utmost
limit
.
the
road
along
which
they
moved
was
bordered
on
both
sides
by
dead
horses

who
had
fallen

several
times
during

false
alarms

been
given
and
the
soldiers
of
the
escort
had
raised
their
muskets
fired
and
run
head
long
crushing
one
another
but
had
after
wards
reassembled
and
abused
each
other
for
their
causeless
panic
.
these
three
groups
traveling
together
the
cavalry
stores
the
convoy
of
prisoners
and
junots
baggage

still
constituted
a
sep
arate
and
united

each
of
the
groups
was
rapidly
melting
away

of
the
artillery
baggage
train
which
had
consisted
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
wagons
not
more
than
sixty
now

the

had
been

left

some
of

also
had
been
captured
or
abandoned
.
three
wagons
had
been
raided
and
robbed
by
stragglers
from

.
from
the
talk
of
the
germans
pierre
learned
that
a
larger
guard
had
been
allotted
to
that
baggage
train
than
to
the
prisoners
and
that
one
of
their
comrades
a
german
soldier
had
been
shot
by

marshals

order
because
a
silver
spoon
belonging
to
the
marshal
had
been
found
in
his
possession

the

of

had
melted

of
all
.
of
the
three
hundred
and
thirty
men
who
had
set
out
from
moscow
fewer
than
a
hundred
now
remained
.
the
prisoners
were
more
burdensome
to
the
escort
than
even
the
cavalry
saddles
or
junots
baggage
.
they
under
stood
that
the
saddles
and
junots
spoon
might
be
of
some
use
but
that
cold
and
hungry
soldiers
should
have
to
stand
and
guard
equally
cold
and
hungry
russians
who
froze
and
lagged
behind
on
the
road
in
which
case
the
order
was
to
shoot
them
was
not
merely
in
comprehensible
but
revolting
.

as
if
afraid
in
the
grievous
condition
they
themselves
were
in
of
giving
way
to
the
pity
they
felt
for
the
prisoners
and
so
rendering
their
own
plight
still
worse
treated
them
with
particular
moroseness
and
severity
.
at
dorogobuzh
while
the
soldiers
of
the
convoy
after
locking
the
prisoners
in
a
stable
had
gone
off
to
pillage
their
own
stores
several
of
the
soldier
prisoners
tunneled
under
the
wall
and
ran
away
but
were
recaptured
by
the
french
and
shot
.
the
arrangement
adopted
when
they
start
ed
that
the
officer
prisoners
should
be
kept
separate
from
the
rest
had
long
since
been
abandoned
.
all
who
could
walk
went
together
and
after
the
third
stage
pierre
had
rejoined
karatdev
and
the
grayblue
bandylegged
dog
that
had
chosen
karataev
for
its
master
.
on
the
third
day
after
leaving
moscow
karatdev
again
fell
ill
with
the
fever
he
had
suffered
from
in
the
hospital
in
moscow
and
as
he
grew
gradually
weaker
pierre
kept
away
from
him
.
pierre
did
not
know
why
but
since
karataev
had
begun
to
grow
weaker
it
had
cost
him
an
effort
to
go
near
him
.
when
he
did
so
and
heard
the
subdued
moaning
with
which
karataev
generally
lay
down
at
the
halting
places
and
when
he
smelled
the
odor
emanating
from
him
which
was
now
stronger
than
before
pierre
moved
farther
away
and
did
not
think
about
him
.
while
imprisoned
in
the
shed
pierre
had
learned
not
with
his
intellect
but
with
his
whole
being
by
life
itself
that
man
is
created
for
happiness
that
happiness
is
within
him
in
the
satisfaction
of
simple
human
needs
and
that
all
unhappiness
arises
not
from
privation
but
from
superfluity
.
and
now
during
these
last
three
weeks
of
the
march
he
had
learned
still
another
new
consolatory
truththat
noth
ing
in
this
world
is
terrible
.
he
had
learned
that
as
there
is
no
condition
in
which
man
can
be
happy
and
entirely
free
so
there
is
no
condition
in
which
he
need
be
unhappy
and
lack
freedom
.
he
learned
that
suffering
and
freedom
have
their
limits
and
that
those
limits
are
very
near
together
that
the
person
in
a
bed
of
roses
with
one
crumpled
petal
suffered
as
keenly
as
he
now
sleeping
on
the
bare
damp
earth
with
one
side
growing
chilled
while
the
other
was
warming
and
that
when
he
had
put
on
tight
dancing
shoes
he
had
suffered
just
as
he
did
now
when
he
walked
with
bare
feet
that
were
covered
with
sores
his
footgear
hav
ing
long
since
fallen
to
pieces
.
he
discovered
that
when
he
had
married
his
wife
of
his
own
free
will
as
it
had
seemed
to
himhe
had
been
no
more
free
than
now
when
they
locked
him
up
at
night
in
a
stable
.
of
all
that
he
himself
subsequently
termed
his
sufferings
but
which
at
the
time
he
scarcely
felt
the
worst
was
the
state
of
his
bare
raw
and
scabcovered
feet
.
the
horseflesh
was
appetizing
and
nourish
ing
the
saltpeter
flavor
of
the
gunpowder
they
used
instead
of
salt
was
even
pleasant
there
was
no
great
cold
it
was
always
warm
walking
in
the
daytime
and
at
night
there
were
the
campfires
the
lice
that
devoured
him
warmed
his
body
.
the
one
thing
that
was
at
first
hard
to
bear
was
his
feet
.
after
the
second
days
march
pierre
having
examined
his
feet
by
the
campfire
thought
it
would
be
impossible
to
walk
on
them
but
when
everybody
got
up
he
went
along
limp
ing
and
when
he
had
warmed
up
walked
without
feeling
the
pain
though
at
night
his
feet
were
more
terrible
to
look
at
than
before
.
however
he
did
not
look
at
them
now
but
thought
of
other
things
.
only
now
did
pierre
realize
the
full
strength
of
life
in
man
and
the
saving
power
he
has
of
transferring
his
attention
from
one
thing
to
another
which
is
like
the
safety
valve
of
a
boiler
that
allows
superfluous
steam
to
blow
off
when
the
pressure
exceeds
a
certain
limit
.
he
did
not
see
and
did
not
hear
how
they
shot
the
prisoners
who
lagged
behind
though
more
than
a
hundred
perished
in
that
way
.
he
did
not
think
of
karataev
who
grew
weaker
every
day
and
evidently
would
soon
have
to
share
that
fate
.
still
less
did
pierre
think
about
himself
.
the
harder
his
position
became
and
the
more
terrible
the
future
the
more
inde
pendent
of
that
position
in
which
he
found
himself
were
the
joyful
and
comforting
thoughts
memories
and
imaginings
that
came
to
him
.
chapter
xiii
at
midday
on
the
twentysecond
of
october
pierre
was
going
uphill
along
the
muddy
slip
pery
road
looking
at
his
feet
and
at
the
rough
ness
of
the
way
.
occasionally
he
glanced
at
the
familiar
crowd
around
him
and
then
again
at
his
feet
.
the
former
and
the
latter
were
alike
familiar
and
his
own
.
the
bluegray
bandy
legged
dog
ran
merrily
along
the
side
of
the
road
sometimes
in
proof
of
its
agility
and
self
satisfaction
lifting
one
hind
leg
and
hopping
along
on
three
and
then
again
going
on
all
four
and
rushing
to
bark
at
the
crows
that
sat
6o6
war
and
peace
on
the
carrion
.
the
dog
was
merrier
and
sleek
er
than
it
had
been
in
moscow
.
all
around
lay
the
flesh
of
different
animals
from
men
to
horses
in
various
stages
of
decomposition
and
as
the
wolves
were
kept
off
by
the
passing
men
the
dog
could
eat
all
it
wanted
.
it
had
been
raining
since
morning
and
had
seemed
as
if
at
any
moment
it
might
cease
and
the
sky
clear
but
after
a
short
break
it
began
raining
harder
than
before
.
the
saturated
road
no
longer
absorbed
the
water
which
ran
along
the
ruts
in
streams
.
pierre
walked
along
looking
from
side
to
side
counting
his
steps
in
threes
and
reckon
ing
them
off
on
his
fingers
.
mentally
address
ing
the
rain
he
repeated
now
then
now
then
go
on
pelt
harder
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
thinking
of
nothing
but
far
down
and
deep
within
him
his
soul
was
occupied
with
something
impor
tant
and
comforting
.
this
something
was
a
most
subtle
spiritual
deduction
from
a
con
versation
with
karataev
the
day
before
.
at
their
yesterdays
halting
place
feeling
chilly
by
a
dying
campfire
pierre
had
got
up
and
gone
to
the
next
one
which
was
burning
better
.
there
platon
karataev
was
sitting
cov
ered
up
head
and
all
with
his
greatcoat
as
if
it
were
a
vestment
telling
the
soldiers
in
his
effective
and
pleasant
though
now
feeble
voice
a
story
pierre
knew
.
it
was
already
past
mid
night
the
hour
when
karataev
was
usually
free
of
his
fever
and
particularly
lively
.
when
pierre
reached
the
fire
and
heard
platon
s
voice
enfeebled
by
illness
and
saw
his
pathetic
face
brightly
lit
up
by
the
blaze
he
felt
a
pain
ful
prick
at
his
heart
.
his
feeling
of
pity
for
this
man
frightened
him
and
he
wished
to
go
away
but
there
was
no
other
fire
and
pierre
sat
down
trying
not
to
look
at
plat6n
.
well
how
are
you
he
asked
.
how
am
i
if
we
grumble
at
sickness
god
wont
grant
us
death
replied
plat6n
and
at
once
resumed
the
story
he
had
begun
.
and
so
brother
he
continued
with
a
smile
on
his
pale
emaciated
face
and
a
particu
larly
happy
light
in
his
eyes

you

.

.
pierre
had
long
been
familiar
with
that
story
.
karataev
had
told
it
to
him
alone
some
halfdozen
times
and
always
with
a
specially
joyful
emotion
.
but
well
as
he
knew
it
pierre
now
listened
to
that
tale
as
to
something
new
and
the
quiet
rapture
karataev
evidently
felt
as
he
told
it
communicated
itself
also
to
pierre
.
the
story
was
of
an
old
merchant
who
lived
a
good
and
godfearing
life
with
his
family
and
who
went
once
to
the
nizhni
fair
with
a
com
paniona
rich
merchant
.
having
put
up
at
an
inn
they
both
went
to
sleep
and
next
morning
his
companion
was
found
robbed
and
with
his
throat
cut
.
a
blood
stained
knife
was
found
under
the
old
mer
chants
pillow
.
he
was
tried
knouted
and
his
nostrils
having
been
torn
off
all
in
due
form
as
karataev
put
it
he
was
sent
to
hard
labor
in
siberia
.
and
so
brother
it
was
at
this
point
that
pierre
came
up
ten
years
or
more
passed
by
.
the
old
man
was
living
as
a
convict
submit
ting
as
he
should
and
doing
no
wrong
.
only
he
prayed
to
god
for
death
.
well
one
night
the
convicts
were
gathered
just
as
we
are
with
the
old
man
among
them
.
and
they
began
tell
ing
what
each
was
suffering
for
and
how
they
had
sinned
against
god
.
one
told
how
he
had
taken
a
life
another
had
taken
two
a
third
had
set
a
house
on
fire
while
another
had
simply
been
a
vagrant
and
had
done
nothing
.
so
they
asked
the
old
man
what
are
you
be
ing
punished
for
daddy
i
my
dear
broth
ers
said
he
am
being
punished
for
my
own
and
other
mens
sins
.
but
i
have
not
killed
anyone
or
taken
anything
that
was
not
mine
but
have
only
helped
my
poorer
brothers
.
i
was
a
merchant
my
dear
brothers
and
had
much
property
.
and
he
went
on
to
tell
them
all
about
it
in
due
order
.
i
dont
grieve
for
myself
he
says
god
it
seems
has
chastened
me
.
only
i
am
sorry
for
rny
old
wife
and
the
children
and
the
old
man
began
to
weep
.
now
it
happened
that
in
the
group
was
the
very
man
who
had
killed
the
other
merchant
.
where
did
it
happen
daddy
he
said
.
when
and
in
what
month
he
asked
all
about
it
and
his
heart
began
to
ache
.
so
he
comes
up
to
the
old
man
like
this
and
falls
down
at
his
feet
you
are
perishing
because
of
me
daddy
he
says
.
its
quite
true
lads
that
this
man
he
says
is
being
tortured
innocently
and
for
nothing
i
he
says
did
that
deed
and
i
put
the
knife
under
your
head
while
you
were
asleep
.
forgive
me
daddy
he
says
for
christs
sake

karataev
paused
smiling
joyously
as
he
gazed
into
the
fire
and
he
drew
the
logs
to
gether
.
and
the
old
man
said
god
will
forgive
you
we
are
all
sinners
in
his
sight
.
i
suffer
for
my
own
sins
and
he
wept
bitter
tears
.
well
and
what
do
you
think
dear
friends
karatdev
continued
his
face
brightening
more
book

and
more
with
a
rapturous
smile
as
if
what
he
now
had
to
tell
contained
the
chief
charm
and
the
whole
meaning
of
his
story
what
do
you
think
dear
fellows
that
murderer
confessed
to
the
authorities
.
i
have
taken
six
lives
he
says
he
was
a
great
sinner
but
what
i
am
most
sorry
for
is
this
old
man
.
dont
let
him
suffer
because
of
me
.
so
he
confessed
and
it
was
all
written
down
and
the
papers
sent
off
in
due
form
.
the
place
was
a
long
way
off
and
while
they
were
judging
what
with
one
thing
and
another
filling
in
the
papers
all
in
due
formthe
authorities
i
meantime
passed
.
the
affair
reached
the
tsar
.
after
a
while
the
tsars
decree
came
to
set
the
merchant
free
and
give
him
a
compensation
that
had
been
awarded
.
the
paper
arrived
and
they
began
to
look
for
the
old
man
.
where
is
the
old
man
who
has
been
suffering
innocently
and
in
vain
a
paper
has
come
from
the
tsar
so
they
began
looking
for
him
here
karatdevs
lower
jaw
trembled
but
god
had
already
forgiven
him
he
was
dead
thats
how
it
was
dear
fellows
karataev
concluded
and
sat
for
a
long
time
silent
gazing
before
him
with
a
smile
.
and
pierres
soul
was
dimly
but
joyfully
filled
not
by
the
story
itself
but
by
its
mysteri
ous
significance
by
the
rapturous
joy
that
lit
up
karataevs
face
as
he
told
it
and
the
mystic
significance
of
that
joy
.

suddenly
cried
a
voice
.
a
pleasant
feeling
of
excitement
and
an
ex
pectation
of
something
joyful
and
solemn
was
aroused
among
the
soldiers
of
the
convoy
and
the
prisoners
.
from
all
sides
came
shouts
of
command
and
from
the
left
came
smartly
dressed
cavalrymen
on
good
horses
passing
the
prisoners
at
a
trot
.
the
expression
on
all
faces
showed
the
tension
people
feel
at
the
approach
of
those
in
authority
.
the
prisoners
thronged
together
and
were

hardly
had
the

passed
before
a
carriage
drawn
by
six

horses
rattled
by
.
pierre
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
man
in
a
threecornered
hat
with
a
tranquil
look
on
his
handsome
plump
white
face
.
it
was
one
of
the
marshals
.
his
eye
fell
on
pierres
large
and
striking
figure
and
in
the
expression
with
which
he
frowned
and
looked
l
to
your
places
away
pierre
thought
he
detected
sympathy
and
a
desire
to
conceal
that
sympathy
.
the
general
in
charge
of
the
stores
galloped
after
the
carriage
with
a
red
and
frightened
face
whipping
up
his
skinny
horse
.
several
officers
formed
a
group
and
some
soldiers
crowded
round
them
.
their
faces
all
looked
excited
and
worried
.
what
did
he
say
what
did
he
say
pierre
heard
them
ask
.
while
the
marshal
was
passing
the
prison
ers
had
huddled
together
in
a
crowd
and
pierre
saw
karatdev
whom
he
had
not
yet
seen
that
morning
.
he
sat
in
his
short
overcoat
leaning
against
a
birch
tree
.
on
his
face
be
sides
the
look
of
joyful
emotion
it
had
worn
yesterday
while
telling
the
tale
of
the
merchant
who
suffered
innocently
there
was
now
an
ex
pression
of
quiet
solemnity
.
karataev
looked
at
pierre
with
his
kindly
round
eyes
now
filled
with
tears
evidently
wishing
him
to
come
near
that
he
might
say
something
to
him
.
but
pierre
was
not
suffi
ciently
sure
of
himself
.
he
made
as
if
he
did
not
notice
that
look
and
moved
hastily
away
.
when
the
prisoners
again
went
forward
pierre
looked
round
.
karatdev
was
still
sitting
at
the
side
of
the
road
under
the
birch
tree
and
two
frenchmen
were
talking
over
his
head
.
pierre
did
not
look
round
again
but
went
limping
up
the
hill
.
from
behind
where
karatdev
had
been
sit
ting
came
the
sound
of
a
shot
.
pierre
heard
it
plainly
but
at
that
moment
he
remembered
that
he
had
not
yet
finished
reckoning
up
how
many
stages
still
remained
to
smolensk
a
cal
culation
he
had
begun
before
the
marshal
went
by
.
and
he
again
started
reckoning
.
two
french
soldiers
ran
past
pierre
one
of
whom
carried
a
lowered
and
smoking
gun
.
they
both
looked
pale
and
in
the
expression
on
their
faces
one
of
them
glanced
timidly
at
pierre
there
was
something
resembling
what
he
had
seen
on
the
face
of
the
young
soldier
at
the
execution
.
pierre
looked
at
the
soldier
and
remembered
that
two
days
before
that
man
had
burned
his
shirt
while
drying
it
at
the
fire
and
how
they
had
laughed
at
him
.
behind
him
where
karataev
had
been
sit
ting
the
dog
began
to
howl
.
what
a
stupid
beast
why
is
it
howling
thought
pierre
.
his
comrades
the
prisoner
soldiers
walking
beside
him
avoided
looking
back
at
the
place
where
the
shot
had
been
fired
and
the
dog
was
howling
just
as
pierre
did
but
there
wis
a
set
look
on
all
their
faces

down
with

back

real

karatdevl
came
to
pierres
mind
.
and
suddenly
he
saw
vividly
before
him
a
longforgotten
kindly
old
man
who
had
given
him
geography
lessons
in
switzerland
.
wait
a
bit
said
the
old
man
and
showed
pierre
a
globe
.
this
globe
was
alivea
vibrating
ball
without
fixed
dimensions
.
its
whole
surface
consisted
of
drops
closely
pressed
together
and
all
these
drops
moved
and
changed
places
sometimes
several
of
them
merging
into
one
sometimes
one
dividing
into
many
.
each
drop
tried
to
spread
out
and
occupy
as
much
space
as
possible
but
others
striving
to
do
the
same
compressed
it
sometimes
destroyed
it
and
sometimes
merged
with
it
.
that
is
life
said
the
old
teacher
.
how
simple
and
clear
it
is
thought
pierre
.
how
is
it
i
did
not
know
it
before
god
is
in
the
midst
and
each
drop
tries
to
expand
so
as
to
reflect
him
to
the
greatest
extent
.
and
it
grows
merges
disappears
from
the
surface
sinks
to
the
depths
and
again
emerges
.
there
now
karataev
has
spread
out
and
disappeared
.
do
you
understand
my
child
said
the
teacher
.
do
you
understand
damn
you
shouted
a
voice
and
pierre
woke
up
.
he
lifted
himself
and
sat
up
.
a
frenchman
who
had
just
pushed
a
russian
soldier
away
was
squatting
by
the
fire
engaged
in
roasting
a
piece
of
meat
stuck
on
a
ramrod
.
his
sleeves
were
rolled
up
and
his
sinewy
hairy
red
hands
with
their
short
fingers
deftly
turned
the
ram
rod
.
his
brown
morose
face
with
frowning
brows
was
clearly
visible
by
the
glow
of
the
charcoal
.
its
all
the
same
to
him
he
muttered
turn
ing
quickly
to
a
soldier
who
stood
behind
him
.
brigand
get
away
and
twisting
the
ramrod
he
looked
gloom
ily
at
pierre
who
turned
away
and
gazed
into
the
darkness
.
a
prisoner
the
russian
soldier
the
frenchman
had
pushed
away
was
sitting
near
the
fire
patting
something
with
his
hand
.
looking
more
closely
pierre
recognized
the
bluegray
dog
sitting
beside
the
soldier
wag
ging
its
tail
.
ah
hes
come
said
pierre
.
and
plat
he
began
but
did
not
finish
.
suddenly
and
simultaneously
a
crowd
of
memories
awoke
in
his
fancy
of
the
look
pla
t6n
had
given
him
as
he
sat
under
the
tree
of
the
shot
heard
from
that
spot
of
the
dogs
howl
of
the
guilty
faces
of
the
two
frenchmen
as
they
ran
past
him
of
the
lowered
and
smok
ing
gun
and
of
karatdevs
absence
at
this
halt
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
realizing
that
karataev
had
been
killed
but
just
at
that
in
stant
he
knew
not
why
the
recollection
came
to
his
mind
of
a
summer
evening
he
had
spent
with
a
beautiful
polish
lady
on
the
veranda
of
his
house
in
kiev
.
and
without
linking
up
the
events
of
the
day
or
drawing
a
conclusion
from
them
pierre
closed
his
eyes
seeing
a
vision
of
the
country
in
summertime
mingled
with
memories
of
bathing
and
of
the
liquid
vibrating
globe
and
he
sank
into
water
so
that
it
closed
over
his
head
.
before
sunrise
he
was
awakened
by
shouts
and
loud
and
rapid
firing
.
french
soldiers
were
running
past
him
.
the
cossacks
one
of
them
shouted
and
a
moment
later
a
crowd
of
russians
surround
ed
pierre
.
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
understand
what
was
happening
to
him
.
all
around
he
heard
his
comrades
sobbing
with
joy
.
brothers

darlings
old

exclaimed
weeping
as
they
embraced

the
hussars
and
cossacks
crowded
round
the
prisoners
one
offered
them
clothes
an
other
boots
and
a
third
bread
.
pierre
sobbed
as
he
sat
among
them
and
could
not
utter
a
word
.
he
hugged
the
first
soldier
who
ap
proached
him
and
kissed
him

at

after
the
twentyeighth
of
october
when
the
frosts
began
the
flight
of
the
french
as
sumed
a
still
more
tragic
character
with
men
freezing
or
roasting
themselves
to
death
at
the
campfires
while
carriages
with
people
dressed
in
furs
continued
to
drive
past
carrying
away
the
property
that
had
been
stolen
by
the
em
peror
kings
and
dukes
but
the
process
of
the
flight
and
disintegration
of
the
french
army
went
on
essentially
as
before
.
from
moscow
to
vyizma
the
french
army
of
seventythree
thousand
men
not
reckoning
the
guards
who
did
nothing
during
the
whole
war
but
pillage
was
reduced
to
thirty
six
thousand
though
not
more
than
five
thou
sand
had
fallen
in
battle
.
from
this
beginning
the
succeeding
terms
of
the
progression
could
be
determined
mathematically
.
the
french
army
melted
away
and
perished
at
the
same
rate
from
moscow
to
vyazma
from
vyazma
to
smolensk
from
smolensk
to
the
berezina
and
from
the
berezina
to
vilna
independently
of
the
greater
or
lesser
intensity
of
the
cold
the
pursuit
the
barring
of
the
way
or
any
other
particular
conditions
.
beyond
vyazma
the
french
army
instead
of
moving
in
three
col
umns
huddled
together
into
one
mass
and
so
went
on
to
the
end
.

chapter
xvii
the
movements
of
the
russian
and
french
armies
during
the
campaign
from
moscow
back
to
the
niemen
were
like
those
in
a
game
of
russian
blindmans
bluff
in
which
two
players
are
blindfolded
and
one
of
them
oc
casionally
rings
a
little
bell
to
inform
the
catcher
of
his
whereabouts
.
first
he
rings
his
bell
fearlessly
but
when
he
gets
into
a
tight
6io
war
and
peace
place
he
runs
away
as
quietly
as
he
can
and
often
thinking
to
escape
runs
straight
into
his
opponents
arms
.
at
first
while
they
were
still
moving
along
the
kaluga
road
napoleons
armies
made
their
presence
known
but
later
when
they
reached
the
smolensk
road
they
ran
holding
the
clapper
of
their
bell
tight
and
of
ten
think
ing
they
were
escaping
ran
right
into
the
rus
sians
.
owing
to
the
rapidity
of
the
french
flight
and
the
russian
pursuit
and
the
consequent
exhaustion
of
the
horses
the
chief
means
of
approximately
ascertaining
the
enemys
posi
tionby
cavalry
scoutingwas
not
available
.
besides
as
a
result
of
the
frequent
and
rapid
change
of
position
by
each
army
even
what
information
was
obtained
could
not
be
de
livered
in
time
.
if
news
was
received
one
day
that
the
enemy
had
been
in
a
certain
position
the
day
before
by
the
third
day
when
some
thing
could
have
been
done
that
army
was
already
two
days
march
farther
on
and
in
quite
another
position
.
one
army
fled
and
the
other
pursued
.
be
yond
smolensk
there
were
several
different
roads
available
for
the
french
and
one
would
have
thought
that
during
their
stay
of
four
days
they
might
have
learned
where
the
enemy
was
might
have
arranged
some
more
advan
tageous
plan
and
undertaken
something
new
.
but
after
a
four
days
halt
the
mob
with
no
maneuvers
or
plans
again
began
running
along
the
beaten
track
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
but
along
the
old
the
worst
road
through
krasnoe
and
orsha
.
expecting
the
enemy
from
behind
and
not
in
front
the
french
separated
in
their
flight
and
spread
out
over
a
distance
of
twentyfour
hours
.
in
front
of
them
all
fled
the
emperor
then
the
kings
then
the
dukes
.
the
russian
army
expecting
napoleon
to
take
the
road
to
the
right
beyond
the
dnieper
which
was
the
only
reasonable
thing
for
him
to
do
them
selves
turned
to
the
right
and
came
out
onto
the
highroad
at
krasnoe
.
and
here
as
in
a
game
of
blindmans
buff
the
french
ran
into
our
vanguard
.
seeing
their
enemy
unexpect
edly
the
french
fell
into
confusion
and
stopped
short
from
the
sudden
fright
but
then
they
resumed
their
flight
abandoning
their
com
rades
who
were
farther
behind
.
then
for
three
days
separate
portions
of
the
french
army
first
murats
the
vicekings
then
davouts
and
then
neys
ran
as
it
were
the
gauntlet
of
the
russian
army
.
they
abandoned
one
an
other
abandoned
all
their
heavy
baggage
their
artillery
and
half
their
men
and
fled
getting
past
the
russians
by
night
by
making
semicircles
to
the
right
.
ney
who
came
last
had
been
busying
him
self
blowing
up
the
walls
of
smolensk
which
were
in
nobodys
way
because
despite
the
un
fortunate
plight
of
the
french
or
because
of
it
they
wished
to
punish
the
floor
against
which
they
had
hurt
themselves
.
ney
who
had
had
a
corps
of
ten
thousand
men
reached
napoleon
at
orsha
with
only
one
thousand
men
left
having
abandoned
all
the
rest
and
all
his
cannon
and
having
crossed
the
dnieper
at
night
by
stealth
at
a
wooded
spot
.
from
orshd
they
fled
farther
along
the
road
to
vilna
still
playing
at
blindmans
buff
with
the
pursuing
army
.
at
the
berezina
they
again
became
disorganized
many
were
drowned
and
many
surrendered
but
those
who
got
across
the
river
fled
farther
.
their
supreme
chief
donned
a
fur
coat
and
having
seated
himself
in
a
sleigh
galloped
on
alone
abandoning
his
companions
.
the
others
who
could
do
so
drove
away
too
leaving
those
who
could
not
to
surrender
or
die
.
chapter
xviii
this
campaign
consisted
in
a
flight
of
the
french
during
which
they
did
all
they
could
to
destroy
themselves
.
from
the
time
they
turned
onto
the
kaluga
road
to
the
day
their
leader
fled
from
the
army
none
of
the
move
ments
of
the
crowd
had
any
sense
.
so
one
might
have
thought
that
regarding
this
period
of
the
campaign
the
historians
who
attributed
the
actions
of
the
mass
to
the
will
of
one
man
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
make
the
story
of
the
retreat
fit
their
theory
.
but
no
mountains
of
books
have
been
written
by
the
historians
about
this
campaign
and
every
where
are
described
napoleons
arrangements
the
maneuvers
and
his
profound
plans
which
guided
the
army
as
well
as
the
military
genius
shown
by
his
marshals
.
the
retreat
from
maloyaroslavets
when
he
had
a
free
road
into
a
wellsupplied
district
and
the
parallel
road
was
open
to
him
along
which
kutiizov
afterwards
pursued
him
this
unnecessary
retreat
along
a
devastated
road
is
explained
to
us
as
being
due
to
profound
considerations
.
similarly
profound
considera
tions
are
given
for
his
retreat
from
smolensk
to
orsha
.
then
his
heroism
at
krasnoe
is
de
scribed
where
he
is
reported
to
have
been
prepared
to
accept
battle
and
take
personal
book
fourteen

command
and
to
have
walked
about
with
a
birch
stick
and
said
jai
assez
fait
iempereur
il
est
temps
de
faire
le
general

but
nevertheless
immedi
ately
ran
away
again
abandoning
to
its
fate
the
scattered
fragments
of
the
army
he
left
behind
.
then
we
are
told
of
the
greatness
of
soul
of
the
marshals
especially
of
ney
a
greatness
of
soul
consisting
in
this
that
he
made
his
way
by
night
around
through
the
forest
and
across
the
dnieper
and
escaped
to
orsha
abandon
ing
standards
artillery
and
nine
tenths
of
his
men
.
and
lastly
the
final
departure
of
the
great
emperor
from
his
heroic
army
is
presented
to
us
by
the
historians
as
something
great
and
characteristic
of
genius
.
even
that
final
run
ning
away
described
in
ordinary
language
as
the
lowest
depth
of
baseness
which
every
child
is
taught
to
be
ashamed
of
even
that
act
finds
justification
in
the
historians
language
.
when
it
is
impossible
to
stretch
the
very
elastic
threads
of
historical
ratiocination
any
farther
when
actions
are
clearly
contrary
to
all
that
humanity
calls
right
or
even
just
the
historians
produce
a
saving
conception
of
greatness
.
greatness
it
seems
excludes
the
standards
of
right
and
wrong
.
for
the
great
man
nothing
is
wrong
there
is
no
atrocity
for
which
a
great
man
can
be
blamed
.
cest
grand

say
the
historians

what
russian
reading
the
account
of
the
last
part
of
the
campaign
of
1812
has
not
experi
enced
an
uncomfortable
feeling
of
regret
dis
satisfaction
and
perplexity
who
has
not
asked
himself
how
it
is
that
the
french
were
not
all
captured
or
destroyed
when
our
three
armies
surrounded
them
in
superior
numbers
when
the
disordered
french
hungry
and
freezing
surrendered
in
crowds
and
when
as
the
historians
relate
the
aim
of
the
russians
was
to
stop
the
french
to
cut
them
off
and
capture
them
all
how
was
it
that
the
russian
army
which
when
numerically
weaker
than
the
french
had
given
battle
at
borodin6
did
not
achieve
its
purpose
when
it
had
surrounded
the
french
on
three
sides
and
when
its
aim
was
to
cap
ture
them
can
the
french
be
so
enormously
superior
to
us
that
when
we
had
surrounded
them
with
superior
forces
we
could
not
beat
them
how
could
that
happen
history
or
what
is
called

questions

that
this
oc
curred
because
kutuzov
and
tormdsov
and
chichag6v
and
this
man
and
that
man
did
not
execute
such
and
such
maneuvers
.

.

.

.
but
why
did
they
not
execute
those
maneu
vers
and
why
if
they
were
guilty
of
not
carry
ing
out
a
prearranged
plan
were
they
not
tried
and
punished
but
even
if
we
admitted
that
kutuzov
chichag6v
and
others
were
the
cause
of
the
russian
failures
it
is
still
incomprehen
sible
why
the
position
of
the
russian
army
being
what
it
was
at
krmoe
and
at
the
bere
zina
in
both
cases
we
had
superior
forces
the
french
army
with
its
marshals
kings
and
emperor
was
not
captured
if
that
was
what
the
russians
aimed
at
.
the
explanation
of
this
strange
fact
given
by
russian
military
historians
to
the
effect
that
kutiizov
hindered
an
attack
is
unfound
ed
for
we
know
that
he
could
not
restrain
the
troops
from
attacking
at
vyazma
and
taru
tino
.
why
was
the
russian
army
which
with
in

had
withstood
the
enemy
in
full
strength
at

war
and
peace
the
berezina
by
the
disorganized
crowds
of
the
french
when
it
was
numerically
superior
if
the
aim
of
the
russians
consisted
in
cut
ting
off
and
capturing
napoleon
and
his
mar
shalsand
that
aim
was
not
merely
frustrated
but
all
attempts
to
attain
it
were
most
shame
fully
baffledthen
this
last
period
of
the
cam
paign
is
quite
rightly
considered
by
the
french
to
be
a
series
of
victories
and
quite
wrongly
considered
victorious
by
russian
historians
.
the
russian
military
historians
in
so
far
as
they
submit
to
claims
of
logic
must
admit
that
conclusion
and
in
spite
of
their
lyrical
rhapsodies
about
valor
devotion
and
so
forth
must
reluctantly
admit
that
the
french
retreat
from
moscow
was
a
series
of
victories
for
na
poleon
and
defeats
for
kutuzov
.
but
putting
national
vanity
entirely
aside
one
feels
that
such
a
conclusion
involves
a
con
tradiction
since
the
series
of
french
victories
brought
the
french
complete
destruction
while
the
series
of
russian
defeats
led
to
the
total
destruction
of
their
enemy
and
the
liberation
of
their
country
.
the
source
of
this
contradiction
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
historians
studying
the
events
from
the
letters
of
the
sovereigns
and
the
gen
erals
from
memoirs
reports
projects
and
so
forth
have
attributed
to
this
last
period
of
the
war
of
1812
an
aim
that
never
existed
namely
that
of
cutting
off
and
capturing
napoleon
with
his
marshals
and
his
army
.
there
never
was
or
could
have
been
such
an
aim
for
it
would
have
been
senseless
and
its
attainment
quite
impossible
.
it
would
have
been
senseless
first
because
napoleons
disorganized
army
was
flying
from
russia
with
all
possible
speed
that
is
to
say
was
doing
just
what
every
russian
desired
.
so
what
was
the
use
of
performing
various
opera
tions
on
the
french
who
were
running
away
as
fast
as
they
possibly
could
secondly
it
would
have
been
senseless
to
block
the
passage
of
men
whose
whole
energy
was
directed
to
flight
.
thirdly
it
would
have
been
senseless
to
sacrifice
ones
own
troops
in
order
to
destroy
the
french
army
which
without
external
in
terference
was
destroying
itself
at
such
a
rate
that
though
its
path
was
not
blocked
it
could
not
carry
across
the
frontier
more
than
it
actually
did
in
december
namely
a
hundredth
part
of
the
original
army
.
fourthly
it
would
have
been
senseless
to
wish
to
take
captive
the
emperor
kings
and
dukes
whose
capture
would
have
been
in
the
highest
degree
embarrassing
for
the
russians
as
the
most
adroit
diplomatists
of
the
time
joseph
de
maistre
and
others
recognized
.
still
more
senseless
would
have
been
the
wish
to
capture
army
corps
of
the
french
when
our
own
army
had
melted
away
to
half
before
reaching
krdsnoe
and
a
whole
division
would
have
been
needed
to
convoy
the
corps
of
prisoners
and
when
our
men
were
not
always
getting
full
rations
and
the
prisoners
already
taken
were
perishing
of
hunger
.
all
the
profound
plans
about
cutting
off
and
capturing
napoleon
and
his
army
were
like
the
plan
of
a
market
gardener
who
when
driving
out
of
his
garden
a
cow
that
had
trampled
down
the
beds
he
had
planted
should
run
to
the
gate
and
hit
the
cow
on
the
head
.
the
only
thing
to
be
said
in
excuse
of
that
gardener
would
be
that
he
was
very
angry
.
but
not
even
that
could
be
said
for
those
who
drew
up
this
project
for
it
was
not
they
who
had
suffered
from
the
trampled
beds
.
but
besides
the
fact
that
cutting
off
na
poleon
with
his
army
would
have
been
sense
less
it
was
impossible
.
it
was
impossible
first
because
as
experi
ence
shows
that
a
threemile
movement
of
columns
on
a
battlefield
never
coincides
with
the
plans
the
probability
of
chichag6v
kut
uzov
and
wittgenstein
effecting
a
junction
on
time
at
an
appointed
place
was
so
remote
as
to
be
tantamount
to
impossibility
as
in
fact
thought
kutuzov
who
when
he
received
the
plan
remarked
that
diversions
planned
over
great
distances
do
not
yield
the
desired
re
sults
.
secondly
it
was
impossible
because
to
para
lyze
the
momentum
with
which
napoleons
army
was
retiring
incomparably
greater
forces
than
the
russians
possessed
would
have
been
required
.
thirdly
it
was
impossible
because
the
mili
tary
term
to
cut
off
has
no
meaning
.
one
can
cut
off
a
slice
of
bread
but
not
an
army
.
to
cut
off
an
army
to
bar
its
road
is
quite
impossible
for
there
is
always
plenty
of
room
to
avoid
capture
and
there
is
the
night
when
nothing
can
be
seen
as
the
military
scientists
might
convince
themselves
by
the
example
of
krdsnoe
and
of
the
berezina
.
it
is
only
pos
sible
to
capture
prisoners
if
they
agree
to
be
captured
just
as
it
is
only
possible
to
catch
a
swallow
if
it
settles
on
ones
hand
.
men
can
only
be
taken
prisoners
if
they
surrender
ac
cording
to
the
rules
of
strategy
and
tactics
as
the
germans
did
.
but
the
french
troops
quite
book
fourteen
rightly
did
not
consider
that
this
suited
them
since
death
by
hunger
and
cold
awaited
them
in
flight
or
captivity
alike
.
fourthly
and
chiefly
it
was
impossible
be
cause
never
since
the
world
began
has
a
war
been
fought
under
such
conditions
as
those
that
obtained
in
1812
and
the
russian
army
in
its
pursuit
of
the
french
strained
its
strength
to
the
utmost
and
could
not
have
done
more
without
destroying
itself
.
during
the
movement
of
the
russian
army
from
tarutino
to
krasnoe
it
lost
fifty
thou
sand
sick
or
stragglers
that
is
a
number
equal
to
the
population
of
a
large
provincial
town
.
half
the
men
fell
out
of
the
army
without
a
battle
.
and
it
is
of
this
period
of
the
campaign
when
the
army
lacked
boots
and
sheepskin
coats
was
short
of
provisions
and
without
vodka
and
was
camping
out
at
night
for
months
in
the
snow
with
fifteen
degrees
of
frost
1
when
there
were
only
seven
or
eight
hours
of
daylight
and
the
rest
was
night
in
which
the
influence
of
discipline
cannot
be
maintained
when
men
were
taken
into
that
region
of
death
where
discipline
fails
not
for
a
few
hours
only
as
in
a
battle
but
for
months
where
they
were
every
moment
fighting
death
from
hunger
and
cold
when
half
the
army
perished
in
a
single
monthit
is
of
this
period
of
the
campaign
that
the
historians
tell
us
how
milorddovich
should
have
made
a
flank
march
to
such
and
such
a
place
tormasov
to
another
place
and
chichag6v
should
have
crossed

in
snow
to
somewhere
else
and
how
soandso
routed
and
cut
off
the
french
and
so
on
and
so
on
.
the
russians

not
to
blame
because
other
russians
sitting
in
warm
rooms
proposed
that
they
should
do
what
was
impossible
.
all
that
strange
contradiction
now
difficult
to
understand
between
the
facts
and
the
his
torical
accounts
only
arises
because
the
his
torians
dealing
with
the
matter
have
written
the
history
of
the
beautiful
words
and
senti
ments
of
various
generals
and
not
the
history
of
the
events
.
to
them
the
words
of
milordovich
seem
very
interesting
and
so
do
their
surmises
and
the
rewards
this
or
that
general
received
but
the
question
of
those
fifty
thousand
men
who
were
left
in
hospitals
and
in
graves
does
not
even
interest
them
for
it
does
not
come
with
in
the
range
of
their
investigation
.
yet
one
need
only
discard
the
study
of
the
reports
and
general
plans
and
consider
the
movement
of
those
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
who
took
a
direct
part
in
the
events
and
all
the
questions
that
seemed
insoluble
easily
and
simply
receive
an
immediate
and
certain
solution
.
the
aim
of
cutting
off
napoleon
and
his
army
never
existed
except
in
the
imaginations
of
a
dozen
people
.
it
could
not
exist
because
it
was
senseless
and
unattainable
.
the
people
had
a
single
aim
to
free
their
land
from
invasion
.
that
aim
was
attained
in
the
first
place
of
itself
as
the
french
ran
away
and
so
it
was
only
necessary
not
to
stop
their
flight
.
secondly
it
was
attained
by
the
guerrilla
warfare
which
was
destroying
the
french
and
thirdly
by
the
fact
that
a
large
russian
army
was
following
the
french
ready
to
use
its
strength
in
case
their
movement
stopped
.
the
russian
army
had
to
act
like
a
whip
to
a
running
animal
.
and
the
experienced
driver
knew
it
was
better
to
hold
the
whip
raised
as
a
menace
than
to
strike
the
running
animal
on
the
head
.

the
accounts
with
alpatych
conferred
with
dessalles
about
her
nephew
and
gave
orders
and
made
preparations
for
the
journey
to
moscow
.
natasha
remained
alone
and
from
the
time
princess
mary
began
making
preparations
for
departure
held
aloof
from
her
too
.
princess
mary
asked
the
countess
to
let
natasha
go
with
her
to
moscow
and
both
par
ents
gladly
accepted
this
offer
for
they
saw
their
daughter
losing
strength
every
day
and
thought
that
a
change
of
scene
and
the
advice
of
moscow
doctors
would
be
good
for
her
.
i
am
not
going
anywhere
natasha
replied
when
this
was
proposed
to
her
.
do
please
just
leave
me
alonel
and
she
ran
out
of
the
room
with
difficulty
refraining
from
tears
of
vexa
tion
and
irritation
rather
than
of
sorrow
.
after
she
felt
herself
deserted
by
princess

book

mary
and
alone
in
her
grief
natasha
spent
most
of
the
time
in
her
room
by
herself
sitting
huddled
up
feet
and
all
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
tearing
and
twisting
something
with
her
slender
nervous
fingers
and
gazing
intently
and
fixedly
at
whatever
her
eyes
chanced
to
fall
on
.
this
solitude
exhausted
and
tormented
her
but
she
was
in
absolute
need
of
it
.
as
soon
as
anyone
entered
she
got
up
quickly
changed
her
position
and
expression
and
picked
up
a
book
or
some
sewing
evidently
waiting
im
patiently
for
the
intruder
to
go
.
she
felt
all
the
time
as
if
she
might
at
any
moment
penetrate
that
on
whichwith
a
ter
rible
questioning
too
great
for
her
strength
her
spiritual
gaze
was
fixed
.
one
day
toward
the
end
of
december
natd
sha
pale
and
thin
dressed
in
a
black
woolen
gown
her
plaited
hair
negligently
twisted
into
a
knot
was
crouched
feet
and
all
in
the
corner
of
her
sofa
nervously
crumpling
and
smooth
ing
out
the
end
of
her
sash
while
she
looked
at
a
corner
of
the
door
.
she
was
gazing
in
the
direction
in
which
he
had
gone
to
the
other
side
of
life
.
and
that
other
side
of
life
of
which
she
had
never
be
fore
thought
and
which
had
formerly
seemed
to
her
so
far
away
and
improbable
was
now
nearer
and
more
akin
and
more
comprehen
sible
than
this
side
of
life
where
everything
was
either
emptiness
and
desolation
or
suffer
ing
and
indignity
.
she
was
gazing
where
she
knew
him
to
be
but
she
could
not
imagine
him
otherwise
than
as
he
had
been
here
.
she
now
saw
him
again
as
he
had
been
at
mytishchi
at
tr6itsa
and
at
yarosldvl
.
she
saw
his
face
heard
his
voice
repeated
his
words
and
her
own
and
sometimes
devised
other
words
they
might
have
spoken
.
there
he
is
lying
back
in
an
armchair
in
his
velvet
cloak
leaning
his
head
on
his
thin
pale
hand
.
his
chest
is
dreadfully
hollow
and
his
shoulders
raised
.
his
lips
are
firmly
closed
his
eyes
glitter
and
a
wrinkle
comes
and
goes
on
his
pale
forehead
.
one
of
his
legs
twitches
just
perceptibly
but
rapidly
.
natasha
knows
that
he
is
struggling
with
terrible
pain
.
what
is
that
pain
like
why
does
he
have
that
pain
what
does
he
feel
how
does
it
hurt
him
thought
natasha
.
he
noticed
her
watching
him
raised
his
eyes
and
began
to
speak
seri
ously
one
thing
would
be
terrible
said
he
to
bind
oneself
forever
to
a
suffering
man
.
it
would
be
continual
torture
.
and
he
looked
searchingly
at
her
.
natdsha
as
usual
answered
before
she
had
time
to
think
what
she
would
say
.
she
said
this
cant
go
on
it
wont
.
you
will
get
well
quite
well
.
she
now
saw
him
from
the
commencement
of
that
scene
and
relived
what
she
had
then
felt
.
she
recalled
his
long
sad
and
severe
look
at
those
words
and
understood
the
meaning
of
the
rebuke
and
despair
in
that
protracted
gaze
.
i
agreed
natasha
now
said
to
herself
that
it
would
be
dreadful
if
he
always
con
tinued
to
suffer
.
i
said
it
then
only
because
it
would
have
been
dreadful
for
him
but
he
understood
it
differently
.
he
thought
it
would
be
dreadful
for
me
.
he
then
still
wished
to
live
and
feared
death
.
and
i
said
it
so
awk
wardly
and
stupidly
i
did
not
say
what
i
meant
.
i
thought
quite
differently
.
had
i
said
what
i
thought
i
should
have
said
even
if
he
had
to
go
on
dying
to
die
continually
before
my
eyes
i
should
have
been
happy
compared
with
what
i
am
now
.
now
there
is
nothing

.

.

.
nobody
.
did
he
know
that
no
he
did
not
and
never
will
know
it
.
and
now
it
will
never
never
be
possible
to
put
it
right
.
and
now
he
again
seemed
to
be
saying
the
same
words
to
her
only
in
her
imagination
natdsha
this
time
gave
him
a
different
answer
.
she
stopped
him
and
said
terrible
lor
you
but
not
for
me
you
know
that
for
me
there
is
nothing
in
life
but
you
and
to
suffer
with
you
is
the
great
est
happiness
for
me
and
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
as
he
had
pressed
it
that
terrible
evening
four
days
before
his
death
.
and
in
her
imagination
she
said
other
tender
and
lov
ing
words
whidi
she
might
have
said
then
but
only
spoke
now
i
love
theel

.

.

.
thee
i
love
love

.

.

.
she
said
convulsively
pressing
her
hands
and
setting
her
teeth
with
a
desperate
effort
.

.

.

.
she
was
overcome
by
sweet
sorrow
and
tears
were
already
rising
in
her
eyes
then
she
sud
denly
asked
herself
to
whom
she
was
saying
this
.
again
everything
was
shrouded
in
hard
dry
perplexity
and
again
with
a
strained
frown
she
peered
toward
the
world
where
he
was
.
and
now
now
it
seemed
to
her
she
was
pene
trating
the
mystery
.

.

.

.
but
at
the
instant
when
it
seemed
that
the
incomprehensible
was
revealing
itself
to
her
a
loud
rattle
of
the
door
handle
struck
painfully
on
her
ears
.
dunydsha
her
maid
entered
the
room
quickly
and
abruptly
with
a
frightened
look
on
her
face
and
showing
no
concern
for
her
mistress
.

a
letter
she
finished
with
a
sob
.
chapter
ii
besides
a
feeling
of
aloofness
from
everybody
natdsha
was
feeling
a
special
estrangement
from
the
members
of
her
own
family
.
all
of
them
her
father
mother
and
s6nya
were
so
near
to
her
so
familiar
so
commonplace
that
all
their
words
and
feelings
seemed
an
insult
to
the
world
in
which
she
had
been
living
of
late
and
she
felt
not
merely
indifferent
to
them
but
regarded
them
with
hostility
.
she
heard
dunydshas
words
about
peter
ilynich
and
a
misfortune
but
did
not
grasp
them
.
what
misfortune
what
misfortune
can
happen
to
them
they
just
live
their
own
old
quiet
and
commonplace
life
thought
natd
sha
.
as
she
entered
the
ballroom
her
father
was
hurriedly
coming
out
of
her
mothers
room
.
his
face
was
puckered
up
and
wet
with
tears
.
he
had
evidently
run
out
of
that
room
to
give
vent
to
the
sobs
that
were
choking
him
.
when
he
saw
natdsha
he
waved
his
arms
despairingly
and
burst
into
convulsively
painful
sobs
that
distorted
his
soft
round
face
.

and
weeping
like
a
child
and
quickly
shuffling
on
his
feeble
legs
to
a
chair
he
almost
fell
into
it
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
.
suddenly
an
electric
shock
seemed
to
run
through
natdshas
whole
being
.
terrible
an
guish
struck
her
heart
she
felt
a
dreadful
ache
as
if
something
was
being
torn
inside
her
and
she
were
dying
.
but
the
pain
was
immediately
followed
by
a
feeling
of
release
from
the
op
pressive
constraint
that
had
prevented
her
taking
part
in
life
.
the
sight
of
her
father
the
terribly
wild
cries
of
her
mother
that
she
heard
through
the
door
made
her
immediately
for
get
herself
and
her
own
grief
.
she
ran
to
her
father
but
he
feebly
waved
his
arm
pointing
to
her
mothers
door
.
prin
cess
mary
paland
with
quivering
chin
came
out
from
that
room
and
taking
natdsha
by
the
arm
said
something
to
her
.
natdsha
neither
saw
nor
heard
her
.
she
went
in
with
rapid
steps
pausing
at
the
door
for
an
instant
as
if
strug
gling
with
herself
and
then
ran
to
her
mother
.
the
countess
was
lying
in
an
armchair
in
a
strange
and
awkward
position
stretching
out
and
beating
her
head
against

she
whispered
incessantly
kissing
her
head
her
hands
her
face
and
feeling
her
own
irrepressible
and
streaming
tears
tickling
her
nose
and
cheeks
.
the
countess
pressed
her
daughters
hand
closed
her
eyes
and
became
quiet
for
a
mo
ment
.
suddenly
she
sat
up
with
unaccustomed
swiftness
glanced
vacantly
around
her
and
seeing
natdsha
began
to
press
her
daughters
head
with
all
her
strength
.
then
she
turned
toward
her
daughters
face
which
was
wincing
with
pain
and
gazed
long
at
it
.
natdsha
you
love
me
she
said
in
a
soft
trustful
whisper
.
natdsha
you
would
not

ceive

youll
tell
me
the
whole
truth
natdsha
looked
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
tears
and
in
her
look
there
was
nothing
but
love
and
an
entreaty
for
forgiveness
.

mummy

she
repeated
strain
ing
all
the
power
of
her
love
to
find
some
way
of
taking
on
herself
the
excess
of
grief
that
crushed
her
mother
.
and
again
in
a
futile
struggle
with
reality
her
mother
refusing
to
believe
that
she
could
live
when
her
beloved
boy
was
killed
in
the
bloom
of
life
escaped
from
reality
into
a
world
of
delirium
.
natdsha
did
not
remember
how
that
day
passed
nor
that
night
nor
the
next
day
and
night
.
she
did
not
sleep
and
did
not
leave
her
mother
.
her
persevering
and
patient
love
seemed
completely
to
surround
the
countess
every
moment
not
explaining
or
consoling
but
recalling
her
to
life
.
during
the
third
night
the
countess
kept
very
quiet
for
a
few
minutes
and
natdsha
rested
her
head
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
closed
her
eyes
but
opened
them
again
on
hearing
the
bedstead
creak
.
the
countess
was
sitting
up
in
bed
and
speaking
softly
.

natdsha

embracing

to

and
the
count
tried
to
replace
natdsha
but
could

they
saw
that
she
alone
was
able
to
restrain
her
mother
from
unreasoning
despair
.
for
three
weeks
natdsha
remained
constantly
at
her
mothers
side
sleepingon
a
lounge
chair
in
her
room
making
her
eat
and
drink
and
talking
to
her
incessantly
because
the

sound
of
her
tender
caressing
tones
soothed
her

the

petyas
death
had
torn
from
her
half
her
life
.
when
the
news
of
pdtyas
death
had
come
she
had
been
a
fresh
and
vigorous
woman
of
fifty
but
a
month
later
she
left
her
room
a
listless
old
woman
taking
no
interest
in
life
.
but
the
same
blow
that
almost
killed
the
countess
this
second
blow
restored
natasha
to
life
.

natashas
wound
healed
in
that
way
.
she
thought
her
life
was
ended
but
her
love
for
her
mother
unexpectedly
showed
her
that
the
es

of

was
still
active

so
did

prince
andrews
last
days
had
bound
prin
cess
mary
and
natasha
together
this
new
sor
row
brought
them
still
closer
to
one
another
.
princess
mary
put
off
her
departure
and
for
three
weeks
looked
after
natdsha
as
if
she
had
been
a
sick
child
.
the
last
weeks
passed
in
her
mothers
bedroom
had
strained
natdshas
phys
ical
strength
.
one
afternoon
noticing
natasha
shivering
with
fever
princess
mary
took
her
to
her
own
room
and
made
her
lie
down
on
the
bed
.
nata
sha
lay
down
but
when
princess
mary
had
drawn
the
blinds
and
was
going
away
she
called
her
back
.
i
dont
want
to
sleep
mary
sit
by
me
a
little
.
you
are
tiredtry
to
sleep
.
no
no
.
why
did
you
bring
me
away
she
will
be
asking
for
me
.
she
is
much
better
.
she
spoke
so
well
to
day
said
princess
mary
.
natdsha
lay
on
the
bed
and
in
the
semidark
ness
of
the
room
scanned
princess
marys
face
.
is
she
like
him
thought
natdsha
.
yes
like
and
yet
not
like
.
but
she
is
quite
original
strange
new
and
unknown
.
and
she
loves
me
.
what
is
in
her
heart
all
that
is
good
.
but
how
what
is
her
mind
like
what
does
she
think
about
me
yes
she
is
splendid
mary
she
said
timidly
drawing
princess
marys
hand
to
herself
mary
you
mustnt
think
me
wicked
.
no
mary
darling
how
i
love
you
let
us
be
quite
quite
friends
.
and
natdsha
embracing
her
began
kissing
her
face
and
hands
making
princess
mary
feel
shy
but
happy
by
this
demonstration
of
her
feelings
.
from
that
day
a
tender
and
passionate
friend
ship
such
as
exists
only
between
women
was
established
between
princess
mary
and
nata
sha
.
they
were
continually
kissing
and
saying
tender
things
to
one
another
and
spent
most
of
their
time
together
.
when
one
went
out
the
other
became
restless
and
hastened
to
rejoin
her
.
together
they
felt
more
in
harmony
with
one
another
than

sprang
up

feeling

spoke
of
her

of
her

her

with

of

had
formerly
turned
away

and
to

she
did
not

of

just
as
before
they
never
mentioned
him
so
as
not
to
lower
as
they
thought
their
exalted
feelings
by
words
but
this
silence
about
him
had
the
effect
of
making
them
gradually
begin
to
forget
him
without
being
conscious
of
it
.
natasha
had
grown
thin
and
pale
and
phys
ically
so
weak
that
they
all
talked
about
her
health
and
this
pleased
her
.
but
sometimes
she
was
suddenly
overcome
by
fear
not
only
of
death
but
of
sickness
weakness
and
loss
of
good
looks
and
involuntarily
she
examined
her
bare
arm
carefully
surprised
at
its
thin
ness
and
in
the
morning
noticed
her
drawn
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
piteous
face
in
her
glass
.
it
seemed
to
her
that
things
must
be
so
and
yet
it
was
dreadfully
sad
.
one
day
she
went
quickly
upstairs
and
found
herself
out
of
breath
.
unconsciously
she
immediately
invented
a
reason
for
going
down
and
then
testing
her
strength
ran
up
stairs
again
observing
the
result
.
another
time
when
she
called
dunyasha
her
voice
trembled
so
she
called
again
though
she
could
hear
dunydsha
coming
called
her
in
the
deep
chest
tones
in
which
she
had
been
wont
to
sing
and
listened
attentively
to
herself
.
she
did
not
know
and
would
not
have
be
lieved
it
but
beneath
the
layer
of
slime
that
covered
her
soul
and
seemed
to
her
impene
trable
delicate
young
shoots
of
grass
were
al
ready
sprouting
which
taking
root
would
so
cover
with
their
living
verdure
the
grief
that
weighed
her
down
that
it
would
soon
no
longer
be
seen
or
noticed
.
the
wound
had
be
gun
to
heal
from
within
.
at
the
end
of
january
princess
mary
left
for
moscow
and
the
count
insisted
on
natashas
going
with
her
to

chapter
iv
after
the
encounter
at
vyazma
where
kutii
zov
had
been
unable
to
hold
back
his
troops
in
their
anxiety
to
overwhelm
and
cut
off
the
enemy
and
so
on
the
farther
movement
of
the
fleeing
french
and
of
the
russians
who
pur
sued
them
continued
as
far
as
krdsnoe
with
out
a
battle
.
the
flight
was
so
rapid
that
the
russian
army
pursuing
the
french
could
not
keep
up
with
them
cavalry
and
artillery
horses
broke
down
and
the
information
re
ceived
of
the
movements
of
the
french
was
never
reliable
.
the
men
in
the
russian
army
were
so
worn
out
by
this
continuous
marching
at
the
rate
of
twentyseven
miles
a
day
that
they
could
not
go
any
faster
.
to
realize
the
degree
of
exhaustion
of
the
russian
army
it
is
only
necessary
to
grasp
clearly
the
meaning
of
the
fact
that
while
not
losing
more
than
five
thousand
killed
and
wounded
after
tarutino
and
less
than
a
hun
dred
prisoners
the
russian
army
which
left
that
place
a
hundred
thousand
strong
reached
krdsnoe
with
only
fifty
thousand
.
the
rapidity
of
the
russian
pursuit
was
just
as
destructive
to
our
army
as
the
flight
of
the
french
was
to
theirs
.
the
only
difference
was
that
the
russian
army
moved
voluntarily
with
no
such
threat
of
destruction
as
hung
over
the
french
and
that
the
sick
frenchmen
were
left
behind
in
enemy
hands
while
the
sick
russians
left
behind
were
among
their
own
people
.
the
chief
cause
of
the
wastage
of
napoleons
army
was
the
rapidity
of
its
movement
and
a
con
vincing
proof
of
this
is
the
corresponding
de
crease
of
the
russian
army
.
kutiizov
as
far
as
was
in
his
power
instead
of
trying
to
check
the
movement
of
the
french
as
was
desired
in
petersburg
and
by
the
russian
army
generals
directed
his
whole
activity
here
as
he
had
done
at
tarutino
and
vydzma
to
hastening
it
on
while
easing
the
movement
of
our
army
.
but
besides
this
since
the
exhaustion
and
enormous
diminution
of
the
army
caused
by
the
rapidity
of
the
advance
had
become
evi
dent
another
reason
for
slackening
the
pace
and
delaying
presented
itself
to
kutiizov
.
the
aim
of
the
russian
army
was
to
pursue
the
french
.
the
road
the
french
would
take
was
unknown
and
so
the
closer
our
troops
trod
on
their
heels
the
greater
distance
they
had
to
cover
.
only
by
following
at
some
distance
could
one
cut
across
the
zigzag
path
of
the
french
.
all
the
artful
maneuvers
suggested
by
our
generals
meant
fresh
movements
of
the
army
and
a
lengthening
of
its
marches
where
as
the
only
reasonable
aim
was
to
shorten
those
marches
.
to
that
end
kutiizovs
activity
was
directed
during
the
whole
campaign
from
mos
cow
to
vilna
not
casually
or
intermittently
but
so
consistently
that
he
never
once
deviated
from
it
.
kutiizov
felt
and
knew
not
by
reasoning
or
science
but
with
the
whole
of
his
russian
be
ingwhat
every
russian
soldier
felt
that
the
french
were
beaten
that
the
enemy
was
flying
and
must
be
driven
out
but
at
the
same
time
he
like
the
soldiers
realized
all
the
hardship
of
this
march
the
rapidity
of
which
was
unparal
leled
for
such
a
time
of
year
.

but
to
the
generals
especially
the
foreign
ones
in
the
russian
army
who
wished
to
dis
tinguish
themselves
to
astonish
somebody
and
for
some
reason
to
capture
a
king
or
a
duke
it
seemed
that
now
when
any
battle
must
be
horrible
and
senseless
was
the
very
time
to
fight
and
conquer
somebody
.
kutuzov
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
one
after
another
they
presented
projects
of
maneuvers
to
be
made
with
those
soldiers
illshod
in
sufficiently
clad
and
half
starved
who
within
a
month
and
without
fighting
a
battle
had
dwindled
to
half
their
number
and
who
at
the
best
if
the
flight
continued
would
have
to
go
a
greater
distance
than
that
they
had
already
traversed
before
they
reached
the
frontier
.
this
longing
to
distinguish
themselves
to
maneuver
to
overthrow
and
to
cut
off
showed
itself
particularly
whenever
the
russians
stum
bled
on
the
french
army
.
so
it
was
at
krasnoe
where
they
expected
to
find
one
of
the
three
french
columns
and
stumbled
instead
on
napoleon
himself
with
sixteen
thousand
men
.
despite
all
kutuzovs
efforts
to
avoid
that
ruinous
encounter
and
to
preserve
his
troops
the
massacre
of
the
broken
mob
of
french

though
they
much
regretted
not
having
taken
napoleon
or
at
least
a
marshal
or
a
hero
of
some
sort
and
reproached
one
another
and
especially
kutuzov
for
having
failed
to
do
so
.
these
men
carried
away
by
their
passions
were
but
blind
tools
of
the
most
melancholy
law
of
necessity
but
considered
themselves
heroes
and
imagined
that
they
were
accom
plishing
a
most
noble
and
honorable
deed
.
they
blamed
kutuzov
and
said
that
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
campaign
he
had
pre
vented
their
vanquishing
napoleon
that
he
thought
of
nothing
but
satisfying
his
passions
and
would
not
advance
from
the
linen
fac
tories
because
he
was
comfortable
there
that
at
krasnoe
he
checked
the
advance
because
on
learning
that
napoleon
was
there
he
had
quite
lost
his
head
and
that
it
was
probable
that
he
had
an
understanding
with
napoleon
and
had
been
bribed
by
him
and
so
on
and
so
on
.
not
only
did
his
contemporaries
carried
away
by
their
passions
talk
in
this
way
but
posterity
and
history
have
acclaimed
napoleon
as
grand
while
kutuzov
is
described
by
for
eigners
as
a
crafty
dissolute
weak
old
courtier
and
by
russians
as
something
indefinite
a
sort
of

never

swerving
by

seems

them
something

and
pitiful
and
when
speaking

and
of

they
always
seem
a
little
ashamed
.
and
yet
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
an
histori
cal
character
whose
activity
was
so
unswerv
ingly
directed
to
a
single
aim
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
any
aim
more
worthy
or
more
consonant
with
the
will
of
the
whole
people
.
still
more
difficult
would
it
be
to
find
an
instance
in
history
of
the
aim
of
an
his
torical
personage
being
so
completely
accom
plished
as
that
to
which
all
kutiizovs
efforts
were
directed
in
1812
.
kutiizov
never
talked
of
forty
centuries
looking
down
from
the
pyramids
of
the
sac
rifices
he
offered
for
the
fatherland
or
of
what
he
intended
to
accomplish
or
had
ac
complished
in
general
he
said
nothing
about
himself
adopted
no
prose
always
appeared
to
be
the
simplest
and
most
ordinary
of
men
and
said
the
simplest
and
most
ordinary
things
.
he
wrote
letters
to
his
daughters
and
to
ma
dame
de
stael
read
novels
liked
the
society
of
pretty
women
jested
with
generals
officers
and
soldiers
and
never
contradicted
those
who
tried
to
prove
anything
to
him
.
when
count
rostopchin
at
the
yaiiza
bridge
galloped
up
to
kutiizov
with
personal
reproaches
for
having
caused
the
destruction
of
moscow
and
said
how
was
it
you
promised
not
to
abandon
moscow
without
a
battle
kutiizov
replied
and
i
shall
not
abandon
moscow
without
a
battle
though
moscow
was
then
already
aban
doned
.
when

though
a

before
he
had

quite
the
con

what
did
it
matter
to
him
who
then
alone
amid
a
senseless
crowd
understood
the
whole
tremendous
significance
of
what
was
happening
what
did
it
matter
to
him
whether
rostopchin
attributed
the
calamities
of
mos
cow
to
him
or
to
himself
still
less
could
it
matter
to
him
who
was
appointed
chief
of
the
artillery
.
not
merely
in
these
cases
but
continually
did
that
old
man
who
by
experience
of
life
had
reached
the
conviction
that
thoughts

the
words
serving
as
their
expression
are
not

quite
meaningless

that
man
so
heedless

did
not

utter

be

with

from
which
time
his
disagreement
with
those
about
him
began
he
alone
said
that
the
battle
of
borodind
was
a
victory
and
repeated
this
both
verbally
and
in
his
dispatches
and
re
ports
up
to
the
time
of
his
death
.
he
alone
said
that
the
loss
of
moscow
is
not
the
loss
of

.
in
reply
to
lauristons
proposal
of

he
said
there
can
be
no

for
such
is
the

he
alone
during

of

said
that

everything

he
would
not
sacrifice
a
single
rus
sian
for

frenchmen

and
this
courtier
as
he
is
described
to
us
who
lies
to
arakchdev
to
please
the
emperor
he
alone
incurring
thereby
the
emperors
displeasure
said
in
vflna
that
to
carry
the
war
beyond
the
frontier
is
useless
and
harm
ful
.
nor
do
words
alone
prove
that
only
he
understood
the
meaning
of
the
events
.
his
actions
without
the
smallest
deviation
were
all
directed
to
one
and
the
same
threefold
end
i
to
brace
all
his
strength
for
conflict
with
the
french
2
to
defeat
them
and
3
to
drive
them
out
of

minimizing
as
far
as
pos
sible
the
sufferings
of
our
people
and
of
our
army

this
procrastinator
kutiizov
whose
motto
was
patience
and
time
this
enemy
of
de
book
fifteen
621
cisive
action
gave
battle
at
borodin6
invest
ing
the
preparations
for
it
with
unparalleled
solemnity
.
this
kuttizov
who
before
the
battle
of
austerlitz
began
said
that
it
would
be
lost
he
alone
in
contradiction
to
everyone
else
de
clared
till
his
death
that
borodin6
was
a
vic
tory
despite
the
assurance
of
generals
that
the
battle
was
lost
and
despite
the
fact
that
for
an
army
to
have
to
retire
after
winning
a
battle
was
unprecedented
.
he
alone
during
the
whole
retreat
insisted
that
battles
which
were
useless
then
should
not
be
fought
and
that
a
new
war
should
not
be
begun
nor
the
frontiers
of
russia
crossed
.
it
is
easy
now
to
understand
the
significance
of
these
events
if
only
we
abstain
from
at
tributing
to
the
activity
of
the
mass
aims
that
existed
only
in
the
heads
of
a
dozen
individuals
for
the
events
and
their
results
now
lie
be
fore
us
.
but
how
did
that
old
man
alone
in
opposi
tion
to
the
general
opinion
so
truly
discern
the
importance
of
the
peoples
view
of
the
events
that
in
all
his
activity
he
was
never
once
untrue
to
it
the
source
of
that
extraordinary
power
of
penetrating
the
meaning
of
the
events
then
occuring
lay
in
the
national
feeling
which
he
possessed
in
full
purity
and
strength
.
only
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
he
pos
sessed
this
feeling
caused
the
people
in
so
strange
a
manner
contrary
to
the
tsars
wish
to
select
him
an
old
man
in
disfavor
to
be
their
representative
in
the
national
war
.
and
only
that
feeling
placed
him
on
that
highest
human
pedestal
from
which
he
the
command
er
in
chief
devoted
all
his
powers
not
to
slay
ing
and
destroying
men
but
to
saving
and
showing
pity
on
them
.
that
simple
modest
and
therefore
truly
great
figure
could
not
be
cast
in
the
false
mold
of
a
european
hero
the
supposed
ruler
of
men
that
history
has
invented
.
to
a
lackey
no
man
can
be
great
for
a
lackey
has
his
own
conception
of
greatness
.
chapter
vi
the
fifth
of
november
was
the
first
day
of
what
is
called
the
battle
of
krasnoe
.
toward
evening
after
much
disputing
and
many
mis
takes
made
by
generals
who
did
not
go
to
their
proper
places
and
after
adjutants
had
been
sent
about
with
counterorders
when
it
had
become
plain
that
the
enemy
was
every
where
in
flight
and
that
there
could
and
would
be
no
battle
kutuzov
left
krdsnoe
and
went
to
d6broe
whither
his
headquarters
had
that
day
been
transferred
.
the
day
was
clear
and
frosty
.
kutuzov
rode
to
dobroe
on
his
plump
little
white
horse
fol
lowed
by
an
enormous
suite
of
discontented
generals
who
whispered
among
themselves
be
hind
his
back
.
all
along
the
road
groups
of
french
prisoners
captured
that
day
there
were
seven
thousand
of
them
were
crowding
to
warm
themselves
at
campfires
.
near
d6broe
an
immense
crowd
of
tattered
prisoners
buzz
ing
with
talk
and
wrapped
and
bandaged
in
anything
they
had
been
able
to
get
hold
of
were
standing
in
the
road
beside
a
long
row
of
unharnessed
french
guns
.
at
the
approach
of
the
commander
in
chief
the
buzz
of
talk
ceased
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
kutuzov
who
wearing
a
white
cap
with
a
red
band
and
a
padded
overcoat
that
bulged
on
his
round
shoulders
moved
slowly
along
the
road
on
his
white
horse
.
one
of
the
generals
was
reporting
to
him
where
the
guns
and
prisoners
had
been
captured
.
kutuzov
seemed
preoccupied
and
did
not
listen
to
what
the
general
was
saying
.
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
with
a
dissatisfied
look
as
he
gazed
attentively
and
fixedly
at
these
prison
ers
who
presented
a
specially
wretched
ap
pearance
.
most
of
them
were
disfigured
by
frostbitten
noses
and
cheeks
and
nearly
all
had
red
swollen
and
festering
eyes
.
one
group
of
the
french
stood
close
to
the
road
and
two
of
them
one
of
whom
had
his
face
covered
with
sores
were
tearing
a
piece
of
raw
flesh
with
their
hands
.
there
was
some
thing
horrible
and
bestial
in
the
fleeting
glance
they
threw
at
the
riders
and
in
the
malevolent
expression
with
which
after
a
glance
at
kutu
zov
the
soldier
with
the
sores
immediately
turned
away
and
went
on
with
what
he
was
doing
.
kutuzov
looked
long
and
intently
at
these
two
soldiers
.
he
puckered
his
face
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
pensively
swayed
his
head
.
at
another
spot
he
noticed
a
russian
soldier
laughingly
patting
a
frenchman
on
the
shoulder
saying
something
to
him
in
a
friendly
manner
and
kutuzov
with
the
same
expres
sion
on
his
face
again
swayed
his
head
.
what
were
you
saying
he
asked
the
gen
eral
who
continuing
his
report
directed
the
commander
in
chiefs
attention
to
some
stand
ards
captured
from
the
french
and
standing
in
front
of
the
preobrazhnsk
regiment
.
ah
the
standards
said
kutiizov
evidently
detaching
himself
with
difficulty
from
the
622
war
and
peace
thoughts
that
preoccupied
him
.
he
looked
about
him
absently
.
thousands
of
eyes
were
looking
at
him
from
all
sides
await
ing
a
word
from
him
.
he
stopped
in
front
of
the
preobrazhnsk
regiment
sighed
deeply
and
closed
his
eyes
.
one
of
his
suite
beckoned
to
the
soldiers
carry
ing
the
standards
to
advance
and
surround
the
commander
in
chief
with
them
.
kutuzov
was
silent
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
submitting
with
evident
reluctance
to
the
duty
imposed
by
his
position
raised
his
head
and
began
to
speak
.
a
throng
of
officers
surrounded
him
.
he
looked
attentively
around
at
the
circle
of
officers
recognizing
several
of
them
.
i
thank
you
all
he
said
addressing
the
soldiers
and
then
again
the
officers
.
in
the
still
ness
around
him
his
slowly
uttered
words
were
distinctly
heard
.
i
thank
you
all
for
your
hard
and
faithful
service
.
the
victory
is
complete
and
russia
will
not
forget
you
honor
to
you
forever
.
he
paused
and
looked
round
.
lower
its
head
lower
it
he
said
to
a
soldier
who
had
accidentally
lowered
the
french
eagle
he
was
holding
before
the
pre
obrazhensk
standards
.
lower
lower
thats
it
.
hurrah
lads
he
added
addressing
the
men
with
a
rapid
movement
of
his
chin
.
hurrrahl
roared
thousands
of
voices
.
while
the
soldiers
were
shouting
kutuzov
leaned
forward
in
his
saddle
and
bowed
his
head
and
his
eye
lit
up
with
a
mild
and
ap
parently
ironic
gleam
.
you
see
brothers

.

.

.
said
he
when
the
shouts
had
ceased

.

.

.
and
all
at
once
his
voice
and
the
expression
of
his
face
changed
.
it
was
no
longer
the
commander
in
chief
speaking
but
an
ordinary
old
man
who
wanted
to
tell
his
comrades
something
very
important
.
there
was
a
stir
among
the
throng
of
officers
and
in
the
ranks
of
the
soldiers
who
moved
that
they
might
hear
better
what
he
was
going
to
say
.
you
see
brothers
i
know
its
hard
for
you
but
it
cant
be
helped
bear
up
it
wont
be
for
long
now
well
see
our
visitors
off
and
then
well
rest
.
the
tsar
wont
forget
your
service
.
it
is
hard
for
you
but
still
you
are
at
home
while
they
you
see
what
they
have
come
to
said
he
pointing
to
the
prisoners
.
worse
off
than
our
poorest
beggars
.
while
they
were
strong
we
didnt
spare
ourselves
but
now
we
may
even
pity
them
.
they
are
human
beings
too
.
isnt
it
so
lads
he
looked
around
and
in
the
direct
re
spectful
wondering
gaze
fixed
upon
him
he
read
sympathy
with
what
he
had
said
.
his
face
grew
brighter
and
brighter
with
an
old
mans
mild
smile
which
drew
the
corners
of
his
lips
and
eyes
into
a
cluster
of
wrinkles
.
he
ceased
speaking
and
bowed
his
head
as
if
in
per
plexity
.
but
after
all
who
asked
them
here
serves
them
right
the
bloody
bastards
he
cried
sud
denly
lifting
his
head
.
and
flourishing
his
whip
he
rode
off
at
a
gallop
for
the
first
time
during
the
whole
campaign
and
left
the
broken
ranks
of
the
soldiers
laughing
joyfully
and
shouting
hur
rah
kutuzovs
words
were
hardly
understood
by
the
troops
.
no
one
could
have
repeated
the
field
marshals
address
begun
solemnly
and
then
changing
into
an
old
mans
simplehearted
talk
but
the
hearty
sincerity
of
that
speech
the
feeling
of
majestic
triumph
combined
with
pity
for
the
foe
and
consciousness
of
the
justice
of
our
cause
exactly
expressed
by
that
old
mans
goodnatured
expletives
was
not
merely
understood
but
lay
in
the
soul
of
every
soldier
and
found
expression
in
their
joyous
and
longsustained
shouts
.
afterwards
when
one
of
the
generals
addressed
kutuzov
asking
whether
he
wished
his
caliche
to
be
sent
for
kutuzov
in
answering
unexpectedly
gave
a
sob
being
evidently
greatly
moved
.

when
the
troops
reached
their

ing
place
on
the
eighth
of
november
the
last
day
of
the
krdsnoe
battles
it
was
already
grow
ing
dusk
.
all
day
it
had
been
calm
and
frosty
with
occasional
lightly
falling
snow
and
to
ward
evening
it
began
to
clear
.
through
the
falling
snow
a
purpleblack
and
starry
sky
showed
itself
and
the
frost
grew
keener
.
an
infantry
regiment
which
had
left
taru
tino
three
thousand
strong
but
now
numbered
only
nine
hundred
was
one
of
the
first
to
arrive
that
night
at
its
halting
place
a
village
on
the
highroad
.
the
quartermasters
who
met
the
regiment
announced
that
all
the
huts
were
full
of
sick
and
dead
frenchmen
cavalry
men
and
members
of
the
staff
.
there
was
on
ly
one
hut
available
for
the
regimental
com
mander
.
the
commander
rode
up
to
his
hut
.
the
regiment
passed
through
the
village
and
stacked
its
arms
in
front
of
the
last
huts
.
like
some
huge
manylimbed
animal
the
regiment
began
to
prepare
its
lair
and
its
food
.

one
part
of
it
dispersed
and
waded
kneedeep
through
the
snow
into
a
birch
forest
to
the
right
of
the
village
and
immediately
the
sound
of
axes
and
swords
the
crashing
of
branches
and
merry
voices
could
be
heard
from
there
.
another
section
amid
the
regimental
wagons
and
horses
which
were
standing
in
a
group
was
busy
getting
out
caldrons
and
rye
biscuit
and
feeding
the
horses
.
a
third
section
scattered
through
the
village
arranging
quarters
for
the
staff
officers
carrying
out
the
french
corpses
that
were
in
the
huts
and
dragging
away
boards
dry
wood
and
thatch
from
the
roofs
for
the
campfires
or
wattle
fences
to
serve
for
shelter
.
some
fifteen
men
with
merry
shouts
were
shaking
down
the
high
wattle
wall
of
a
shed
the
roof
of
which
had
already
been
removed
.
now
then
all

cried
the
voices
and
the
huge
surface
of
the
wall
sprinkled
with
snow
and
creaking
with
frost
was
seen
swaying
in
the
gloom
of
the
night
.
the
lower
stakes
cracked
more
and
more
and
at
last
the
wall
fell
and
with
it
the
men
who
had
been
pushing
it
.
loud
coarse
laughter
and

ensued

with

some

of

who
were
on

into
the
village
joined
the
haulers

the
wattle

merry

up
to
suddenly
came
the
authoritative
voice
of
a
sergeant

who
came
upon

men
who
were

the

the
soldier
who
had
been

groaned
and
wiped
his

had
been
scratched
till
it
bled
by
his
falling
against

in

when

said
a
laughing
voice
and
moderating
their
tones
the
men
moved
forward

they
be

one
would
have
thought
that
under
the
al
most
incredibly
wretched
conditions
the
rus
sian
soldiers
were
in
at
that
timelacking
warm
boots
and
sheepskin
coats
without
a
roof
over
their
heads
in
the
snow
with
eighteen
624
degrees
of
frost
1
and
without
even
full
rations
the
commissariat
did
not
always
keep
up
with
the
troops
they
would
have
presented
a
very
sad
and
depressing
spectacle
.
on
the
contrary
the
army
had
never
under
the
best
material
conditions
presented
a
more
cheerful
and
animated
aspect
.
this
was
be
cause
all
who
began
to
grow
depressed
or
who
lost
strength
were
sifted
out
of
the
army
day
by
day
.
all
the
physically
or
morally
weak
had
long
since
been
left
behind
and
only
the
flower
of
the
army
physically
and
mentally
remained
.
more
men
collected
behind
the
wattle
fence
of
the
eighth
company
than
anywhere
else
.
two
sergeants
major
were
sitting
with
them
and
their
campfire
blazed
brighter
than
the
others
.
for
leave
to
sit
by
their
wattle
they
de
manded
contributions
of
fuel
.
eh
makdev
what
has
become
of
you
you
son
of
a
bitch
are
you
lost
or
have
the
wolves
eaten
you
fetch
some
more
wood
shouted
a
redhaired
and
redfaced
man
screwing
up
his
eyes
and
blinking
because
of
the
smoke
but
not
moving
back
from
the
fire
.
and
you
jackdaw
go
and
fetch
some
wood
i
said
he
to
another
soldier
.
this
redhaired
man
was
neither
a
sergeant
nor
a
corporal
but
being
robust
he
ordered
about
those
weaker
than
himself
.
the
soldier
they
called
jackdaw
a
thin
little
fellow
with
a
sharp
nose
rose
obediently
and
was
about
to
go
but
at
that
instant
there
came
into
the
light
of
the
fire
the
slender
handsome
figure
of
a
young
soldier
carrying
a
load
of
wood
.
bring
it
here
thats
fine
they
split
up
the
wood
pressed
it
down
on
the
fire
blew
at
it
with
their
mouths
and
fanned
it
with
the
skirts
of
their
greatcoats
making
the
flames
hiss
and
crackle
.
the
men
drew
nearer
and
lit
their
pipes
.
the
handsome
young
soldier
who
had
brought
the
wood
setting
his
arms
akimbo
began
stamping
his
cold
feet
rapidly
and
deftly
on
the
spot
where
he
stood
.
mother
the
dew

but

.

.

.
he
sang
pre
tending
to
hiccough
after
each
syllable
.
look
out

fly
off
shouted
the
redhaired
man
noticing
that
the
sole
of
the
dancers
boot
was
hanging
loose
.
what
a

said
he
and
hav
ing
sat
down
took
out
of
his
knapsack
a
scrap
of
blue
french
cloth
and
wrapped
it
round
his
foot
.
its

steam

he
added
stretching
out
his
feet
toward
the
fire
.
theyll
soon
be
issuing
us
new
ones
.
they
say
that
when
weve
finished

to

and
that

of
a

has
lagged

after
all
it
seems
said
one
sergeant
major
.
ive
had
an
eye
on
him
this
long
while
said
the
other
.
well
hes
a
poor
sort
of
soldier
.

.

.

.
but
in
the
third
company
they
say
nine
men
were
missing
yesterday
.
yes
its
all
very
well
but
when
a
mans
feet
are
frozen
how
can
he
walk
eh
dont
talk
nonsense
said
a
sergeant
major
.
do
you
want
to
be
doing
the
same
said
an
old
soldier
turning
reproachfully
to
the
man
who
had
spoken
of
frozen
feet
.
well
you
know
said
the
sharpnosed
man
they
called
jackdaw
in
a
squeaky
and
un
steady
voice
raising
himself
at
the
other
side
of
the
fire
a
plump
man
gets
thin
but
for
a
thin
one
its
death
.
take
me
now
ive
got
no
strength
left
he
added
with
sudden
resolu
tion
turning
to
the
sergeant
major
.
tell
them
to
send
me
to
hospital
im
aching
all
over
anyway
i
shant
be
able
to
keep
up
.
thatll
do
thatll
do
replied
the
sergeant
major
quietly
.
the
soldier
said
no
more
and
the
talk
went
what
a
lot
of
those
frenchies
were
taken
today
and
the
fact
is
that
not
one
of
them
had
what
you
might
call
real
boots
on
said
a
soldier
starting
a
new
theme
.
they
were
no
more
than
makebelieves
.
the
cossacks
have
taken
their
boots
.
they
were
clearing
the
hut
for
the
colonel
and
carried
them
out
.
it
was
pitiful
to
see
them
boys
put
in
the
dancer
.
as
they
turned
them
over
one
seemed
still
alive
and
would
you
believe
it
he
jabbered
something
in
their
lingo
.
but
theyre
a
clean
folk
lads
the
first
man
went
on
he
was
white
as
white
as
birchbark
and
some
of
them
are
such
fine
fellows
you
might
think
they
were
nobles
.
well
what
do
you
think
they
make
soldiers
of
all
classes
there
.
but
they
dont
understand
our
talk
at
all

fifteen

aid
the
dancer
with
a
puzzled
smile
.
i
asked
lim
whose
subject
he
was
and
he
jabbered
in
lis
own
way
.
a
queer
lot
but
its
strange
friends
continued
the
nan
who
had
wondered
at
their
whiteness
the
peasants
at
mozhaysk
were
saying
that
when
hey
began
burying
the
dead
where
the
bat
lie
was
you
know
well
those
dead
had
been
lying
there
for
nearly
a
month
and
says
the
peasant
they
lie
as
white
as
paper
clean
and
not
as
much
smell
as
a
puff
of
powder
smoke
.

was
it
from
the
cold
asked
someone
.
youre
a
clever
fellow
from
the
cold
in
deed
why
it
was
hot
.
if
it
had
been
from
the
cold
ours
would
not
have
rotted
either
.
but
he
says
go
up
to
ours
and
they
are
all
rotten
and
maggoty
.
so
he
says
we
tie
our
faces
up
with
kerchiefs
and
turn
our
heads
away
as
we
drag
them
off
we
can
hardly
do
it
.
but
theirs
he
says
are
white
as
paper
and
not
so
much
smell
as
a
whiff
of
gunpowder
.

all
were
silent
.
it
must
be
from
their
food
said
the
ser
geant
major
.
they
used
to
gobble
the
same
food
as
the
gentry
.
no
one
contradicted
him
.
that
peasant
near
mozhdysk
where
the
battle
was
said
the
men
were
all
called
up
from
ten
villages
around
and
they
carted
for
twenty
days
and
still
didnt
finish
carting
the
dead
away
.
and
as
for
the
wolves
he
says

.

.

.
that
was
a
real
battle
said
an
old
soldier
.
its
the
only
one
worth
remembering
but
since
that

.

.

.
its
only
been
tormenting
folk
.
and
do
you
know
daddy
the
day
before
yesterday
we
ran
at
them
and
my
word
they
didnt
let
us
get
near
before
they
just
threw
down
their
muskets
and
went
on
their
knees
.
pardon
they
say
.
thats
only
one
case
.
they
say
pldtov
took
poleon
himself
twice
.
but
he
didnt
know
the
right
charm
.
he
catches
him
and
catches
him
no
good
he
turns
into
a
bird
in
his
hands
and
hies
away
.
and
theres
no
way
of
killing
him
either
.
youre
a
firstclass
liar
kiselev
when
i
come
to
look
at
you
liar
indeed
its
the
real
truth
.
if
he
fell
into
my
hands
when
id
caught
him
id
bury
him
in
the
ground
with
an
aspen
stake
to
fix
him
down
.
what
a
lot
of
men
hes
ruined
well
anyhow
were
going
to
end
it
.
he
wont
come
here
again
remarked
the
old
soldier
yawning
.
the
conversation
flagged
and
the
soldiers
began
settling
down
to
sleep
.
look
at
the
stars
.
its
wonderful
how
they
shine
you
would
think
the
women
had
spread
out
their
linen
said
one
of
the
men
gazing
with
admiration
at
the
milky
way
.
thats
a
sign
of
a
good
harvest
next
year
.
we
shall
want
some
more
wood
.
you
warm
your
back
and
your
belly
gets
frozen
.
thats
queer
.
o
lord
what
are
you
pushing
for
is
the
fire
only
for
you
look
how
hes
sprawling
in
the
silence
that
ensued
the
snoring
of
those
who
had
fallen
asleep
could
be
heard
.
others
turned
over
and
warmed
themselves
now
and
again
exchanging
a
few
words
.
from
a
campfire
a
hundred
paces
off
came
a
sound
of
general
merry
laughter
.
hark
at
them
roaring
there
in
the
fifth
company
said
one
of
the
soldiers
and
what
a
lot
of
them
there
are
one
of
the
men
got
up
and
went
over
to
the
fifth
company
.
theyre
having
such
fun
said
he
coming
back
.
two
frenchies
have
turned
up
.

quite
frozen
and
the
others
an
awful

.
hes
singing
songs
.

.

.

.
oh
ill
go
across
and
have
a
look
.

.

.

.
and
several
of
the
men
went
over
to
the
fifth
company
.
chapter
ix
the
fifth
company
was
bivouacking
at
the
very
edge
of
the
forest
.
a
huge
campfire
was
blazing
brightly
in
the
midst
of
the
snow
lighting
up
the
branches
of
trees
heavy
with
hoarfrost
.
about
midnight
they
heard
the
sound
of
steps
in
the
snow
of
the
forest
and
the
crack
ling
of
dry
branches
.
a
bear
lads
said
one
of
the
men
.
they
all
raised
their
heads
to
listen
and
out
of
the
forest
into
the
bright
firelight
stepped
two
strangely
clad
human
figures
clinging
to
one
another
.
these
were
two
frenchmen
who
had
been
hiding
in
te
forest
.
they
came
up
to
the
fire
hoarsely
uttering
something
in
a
language
our
soldiers
did
not
understand
.
one
was
taller
than
the
other
he
wore
an
officers
hat
and
seemed
quite
exhausted
.
on
approaching
the
fire
he
had
been
going
to
sit
down
but
fell
.
the
other
a
short
sturdy
soldier
with
a
shawl
tied
round
his
head
was
stronger
.
he
raised
his
companion
and
said
something
pointing
to
his
mouth
.
the
soldiers
surrounded
the
frenchmen
spread
a
greatcoat
on
the
ground
66
war
and
peace
for
the
sick
man
and
brought
some
buck
wheat
porridge
and
vodka
for
both
of
them
.
the
exhausted
french
officer
was
ramballe
and
the
man
with
his
head
wrapped
in
the
shawl
was
morel
his
orderly
.
when
morel
had
drunk
some
vodka
and
finished
his
bowl
of
porridge
he
suddenly
be
came
unnaturally
merry
and
chattered
inces
santly
to
the
soldiers
who
could
not
under
stand
him
.
ramballe
refused
food
and
rest
ing
his
head
on
his
elbow
lay
silent
beside
the
campfire
looking
at
the
russian
soldiers
with
red
and
vacant
eyes
.
occasionally
he
emitted
a
longdrawn
groan
and
then
again
became
silent
.
morel
pointing
to
his
shoulders
tried
to
impress
on
the
soldiers
the
fact
that
ram
balle
was
an
officer
and
ought
to
be
warmed
.
a
russian
officer
who
had
come
up
to
the
fire
sent
to
ask
his
colonel
whether
he
would
not
take
a
french
officer
into
his
hut
to
warm
him
and
when
the
messenger
returned
and
said
that
the
colonel
wished
the
officer
to
be
brought
to
him
ramballe
was
told
to
go
.
he
rose
and
tried
to
walk
but
staggered
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
a
soldier
standing
by
held
him
up
.
you
wont
do
it
again
eh
said
one
of
the
soldiers
winking
and
turning
mockingly
to
ramballe
.
oh
you
fool
why
talk
rubbish
lout
that
you
are
a
real
peasant
came
rebukes
from
all
sides
addressed
to
the
jesting
soldier
.
they
surrounded
ramballe
lifted
him
on
the
crossed
arms
of
two
soldiers
and
carried
him
to
the
hut
.
ramballe
put
his
arms
around
their
necks
while
they
carried
him
and
began
wailing
plaintively
oh
you
fine
fellows
my
kind
kind
friends
these
are
men
oh
my
brave
kind
friends
and
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
shoulder
of
one
of
the
men
like
a
child
.
meanwhile
morel
was
sitting
in
the
best
place
by
the
fire
surrounded
by
the
soldiers
.
morel
a
short
sturdy
frenchman
with
in
flamed
and
streaming
eyes
was
wearing
a
womans
cloak
and
had
a
shawl
yed
woman
fashion
round
his
head
over
his
cap
.
he
was
evidently
tipsy
and
was
singing
a
french
song
in
a
hoarse
broken
voice
with
an
arm
thrown
round
the
nearest
soldier
.
the
soldiers
simply
held
their
sides
as
they
watched
him
.

morel
with

to

all
the

the
calamities
their

were
suddenly
concentrated
at
one
moment
into
a
tragic
spectacle
that
remained
in

on

because

the
berezina
river
.
everyone
assured
himself
that
all
would
happen
according
to
plan
and
therefore
insisted
that
it
was
just
the
crossing
of
the
berezina
that
destroyed
the
french
army
.
in
reality
the
results
of
the
cross
ing
were
much
less
disastrous
to
the
french
in
guns
and
men
lost
than
krasnoe
had
been
as
the
figures
show
.
the
sole
importance
of
the
crossing
of
the
berezina
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
plainly
and
indubitably
proved
the
fallacy
of
all
the
plans
for
cutting
off
the
enemys
retreat
and
the
soundness
of
the
only
possible
line
of
action
the
one
kutuzov
and
the
general
mass
of
the
army
demanded
namely
simply
to
follow
the
enemy
up
.
the
french
crowd
fled
at
a
con
tinually
increasing
speed
and
all
its
energy
was
directed
to
reaching
its
goal
.
it
fled
like
a
wounded
animal
and
it
was
impossible
to
block
its
path
.
this
was
shown
not
so
much
by
the
arrangements
it
made
for
crossing
as
by
what
took
place
at
the
bridges
.
when
the
bridges
broke
down
unarmed
soldiers
people
from
moscow
and
women
with
children
who
were
with
the
french
transport
all
carried
on
by
vis
inertiapressed
forward
into
boats
and
into
the
icecovered
water
and
did
not
surrender
.
that
impulse
was
reasonable
.
the
condi
tion
of
fugitives
and
of
pursuers
was
equally
bad
.
as
long
as
they
remained
with
their
own
people
each
might
hope
for
help
from
his
fellows
and
the
definite
place
he
held
among
them
.
but
those
who
surrendered
while
re
maining
in
the
same
pitiful
plight
would
be
on
a
lower
level
to
claim
a
share
in
the
necessi
ties
of
life
.
the
french
did
not
need
to
be
in
formed
of
the
fact
that
half
the
prisoners
with
whom
the
russians
did
not
know
what
to
do
perished
of
cold
and
hunger
despite
their
captors
desire
to
save
them
they
felt
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise
.
the
most
compassion
ate
russian
commanders
those
favorable
to
the
french
and
even
the
frenchmen
in
the
russian
service
could
do
nothing
for
the
prisoners
.
the
french
perished
from
the
con
ditions
to
which
the
russian
army
was
itself
exposed
.
it
was
impossible
to
take
bread
and
627
clothes
from
our
hungry
and
indispensable
soldiers
to
give
to
the
french
who
though
not
harmful
or
hated
or
guilty
were
simply
un
necessary
.
some
russians
even
did
that
but
they
were
exceptions
.
certain
destruction
lay
behind
the
french
but
in
front
there
was
hope
.
their
ships
had
been
burned
there
was
no
salvation
save
in
collective
flight
and
on
that
the
wholestrength
of
the
french
was
concentrated
.
the
farther
they
fled
the
more
wretched
be
came
the
plight
of
the
remnant
especially
after
the
berezina
on
which
in
consequence
of
the
petersburg
plan
special
hopes
had
been
placed
by
the
russians
and
the
keener
grew
the
passions
of
the
russian
commanders
who
blamed
one
another
and
kutuzov
most
of
all
.
anticipation
that
the
failure
of
the
petersburg
berezina
plan
would
be
attributed
to
kutuzov
led
to
dissatisfaction
contempt
and
ridicule
more
and
more
strongly
expressed
.
the
ridi
cule
and
contempt
were
of
course
expressed
in
a
respectful
form
making
it
impossible
for
him
to
ask
wherein
he
was
to
blame
.
they
did
not
talk
seriously
to
him
when
reporting
to
him
or
asking
for
his
sanction
they
appeared
to
be
fulfilling
a
regrettable
formality
but
they
winked
behind
his
back
and
tried
to
mis
lead
him
at
every
turn
.
because
they
could
not
understand
him
all
these
people
assumed
that
it
was
useless
to
talk
to
the
old
man
that
he
would
never
grasp
the
profundity
of
their
plans
that
he
would
answer
with
his
phrases
which
they
thought
were
mere
phrases
about
a
golden
bridge
about
the
impossibility
of
crossing
the
frontier
with
a
crowd
of
tatterdemalions
and
so
forth
.
they
had
heard
all
that
before
.
and
all
he
said
that
it
was
necessary
to
await
provisions
or
that
the
men
had
no
boots
was
so
simple
while
what
they
proposed
was
so
complicated
and
clever
that
it
was
evident
that
he
was
old
and
stupid
and
that
they
though
not
in
power
were
commanders
of
genius
.
after
the
junction
with
the
army
of
the
brilliant
admiral
and
petersburg
hero
witt
genstein
this
mood
and
the
gossip
of
the
staff
reached
their
maximum
.
kutuzov
saw
this
and
merely
sighed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
only
once
after
the
affair
of
the
berezina
did
he
get
angry
and
write
to
bennigsen
who
re
ported
separately
to
the
emperor
the
follow
ing
letter
on
account
of
your
spells
of
ill
health
will
your
excellency
please
be
so
good
as
to

commands
and

from
his
imperial
majesty
.
but
after
bennigsens
departure
the
grand
duke
tsarvich
constantine
pdvlovich
joined
the
army
.
he
had
taken
part
in
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
but
had
subsequently
been
removed
from
the
army
by
kutiizov
.
now
hav
ing
come
to
the
army
he
informed
kutiizov
of
the
emperors
displeasure
at
the
poor
suc
cess
of
our
forces
and
the
slowness
of
their
advance
.
the
emperor
intended
to
join
the
army
personally
in
a
few
days
time
.
the
old
man
experienced
in
court
as
well
as
in
military
affairs
this
same
kutuzov
who
in
august
had
been
chosen
commander
in
chief
against
the
sovereigns
wishes
and
who
had
removed
the
grand
duke
and
heir
apparent
from
the
armywho
on
his
own
authority
and
contrary
to
the
emperors
will
had
decided
on
the
abandonment
of
moscow
now
realized
at
once
that
his
day
was
over
that
his
part
was
played
and
that
the
power
he
was
supposed
to
hold
was
no
longer
his
.
and
he
understood
this
not
merely
from
the
attitude
of
the
court
.
he
saw
on
the
one
hand
that
the
military
business
in
which
he
had
played
his
part
was
ended
and
felt
that
his
mission
was
accomplished
and
at
the
same
time
he
began
to
be
conscious
of
the
physical
weariness
of
his
aged
body
and
of
the
necessity
of
physical
rest
.
on
the
twentyninth
of
november
kutuzov
entered
vflna
his
dear
vilna
as
he
called
it
.
twice
during
his
career
kutuzov
had
been
governor
of
vilna
.
in
that
wealthy
town
which
had
not
been
injured
he
found
old
friends
and
associations
besides
the
comforts
of
life
of
which
he
had
so
long
been
deprived
.
and
he
suddenly
turned
from
the
cares
of
anny
and
state
and
as
far
as
the
passions
that
seethed
around
him
allowed
immersed
himself
in
the
quiet
life
to
which
he
had
formerly
been
ac
customed
as
if
all
that
was
taking
place
and
all
that
had
still
to
be
done
in
the
realm
of
history
did
not
concern
him
at
all
.
chichag6v
one
of
the
most
zealous
cutters

who
had
first
wanted
to
effect
a
diversion
in
greece
and
then
in
warsaw
but
never
wished
to
go
where
he
was
sent
chichag6v
noted
for
the
boldness
with
which
he
spoke
to
the
emperor
and
who
con
sidered
kutuzov
to
be
under
an
obligation
to
him
because
when
he
was
sent
to
make
peace
with
turkey
in
1811
independently
of
kutu
zov
and
found
that
peace
had
already
been
concluded
he
admitted
to
the
emperor
that
the
merit
of
securing
that
peace
was
really
kutiizovs
this
chichag6v
was
the
first
to
meet
kutiizov
at
the
castle
where
the
latter
was
to
stay
.
in
undress
naval
uniform
with
a
dirk
and
holding
his
cap
under
his
arm
he
handed
kutuzov
a
garrison
report
and
the
keys
of
the
town
.
the
contemptuously
respectful
attitude
of
the
younger
men
to
the
old
man
in
his
dot
age
was
expressed
in
the
highest
degree
by
the
behavior
of
chichag6v
who
knew
of
the
ac
cusations
that
were
being
directed
against
kutuzov
.
when
speaking
to
chichagov
kutuzov
in
cidentally
mentioned
that
the
vehicles
packed
with
china
that
had
been
captured
from
him
at
borfsov
had
been
recovered
and
would
be
restored
to
him
.

warmly
replied
chichagov
who
tried
by
every
word
he
spoke
to
prove
his
own
rectitude
and
therefore
imagined
kutuzov
to
be
animated
by
the
same
de
sire
.
kutuzov
shrugging
his
shoulders
replied
with
his
subtle
penetrating
smile
i
meant
merely
to
say
what
i
said
.
contrary
to
the
emperors
wish
kutuzov
detained
the
greater
part
of
the
army
at
vilna
.
those
about
him
said
that
he
became
extra
ordinarily
slack
and
physically
feeble
during
his
stay
in
that
town
.
he
attended
to
army
affairs
reluctantly
left
everything
to
his
gen
erals
and
while
awaiting
the
emperors
arrival
led
a
dissipated
life
.
having
left
petersburg
on
the
seventh
of
december
with
his
suite
count
tolst6y
prince
volk6nski
arakchdev
and
others
the
emperor
reached
vilna
on
the
eleventh
and
in
his
traveling
sleigh
drove
straight
to
the
castle
.
in
spite
of
the
severe
frost
some
hun
dred
generals
and
staff
officers
in
full
parade
uniform
stood
in
front
of
the
castle
as
well
as
a
guard
of
honor
of
the
semenov
regi
ment
.
a
courier
who
galloped
to
the
castle
in
ad
vance
in
a
troyka
with
three
foamflecked
horses
shouted
coming
and
konovnftsyn
rushed
into
the
vestibule
to
inform
kutiizov
who
was
waiting
in
the
hall
porters
little
lodge
.
a
minute
later
the
old
mans
large
stout
figure
in
fulldress
uniform
his
chest
covered
with
orders
and
a
scarf
drawn
round
his
stom
ach
waddled
out
into
the
porch
.
he
put
on
book
fifteen

his
hat
with
its
peaks
to
the
sides
and
holding
his
gloves
in
his
hand
and
walking
with
an
effort
sideways
down
the
steps
to
the
level
of
the
street
took
in
his
hand
the
report
he
had
prepared
for
the
emperor
.
there
was
running
to
and
fro
and
whisper
ing
another
troyka
flew
furiously
up
and
then
all
eyes
were
turned
on
an
approaching
sleigh
in
which
the
figures
of
the
emperor
and
volk6nski
could
already
be
descried
.
from
the
habit
of
fifty
years
all
this
had
a
physically
agitating
effect
on
the
old
general
.
he
carefully
and
hastily
felt
himself
all
over
readjusted
his
hat
and
pulling
himself
to
gether
drew
himself
up
and
at
the
very
mo
ment
when
the
emperor
having
alighted
from
the
sleigh
lifted
his
eyes
to
him
handed
him
the
report
and
began
speaking
in
his
smooth
ingratiating
voice
.
the
emperor
with
a
rapid
glance
scanned
kutiizov
from
head
to
foot
frowned
for
an
in
stant
but
immediately
mastering
himself
went
up
to
the
old
man
extended
his
arms
and
embraced
him
.
and
this
embrace
too
owing
to
a
longstanding
impression
related
to
his
innermost
feelings
had
its
usual
effect
on
kutiizov
and
he
gave
a
sob
.
the
emperor
greeted
the
officers
and
the
semenov
guard
and
again
pressing
the
old
mans
hand
went
with
him
into
the
castle
.
when
alone
with
the
field
marshal
the
em
peror
expressed
his
dissatisfaction
at
the
slow
ness
of
the
pursuit
and
at
the
mistakes
made
at
krisnoe
and
the
berezina
and
informed
him
of
his
intentions
for
a
future
campaign
abroad
.
kutiizov
made
no
rejoinder
or
remark
.
the
same
submissive
expressionless
look
with
which
he
had
listened
to
the
emperors
com
mands
on
the
field
of
austerlitz
seven
years
before
settled
on
his
face
now
.
when
kutiizov
came
out
of
the
study
and
with
lowered
head
was
crossing
the
ballroom
withrtiis
heavy
waddling
gait
he
was
arrested
by
someones
voice
saying
your
serene
highness
kutiizov
raised
his
head
and
looked
for
a
long
while
into
the
eyes
of
count
tolst6y
who
stood
before
him
holding
a
silver
salver
on
which
lay
a
small
object
.
kutiizov
seemed
not
to
understand
what
was
expected
of
him
.
suddenly
he
seemed
to
remember
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
flashed
across
his
puffy
face
and
bowing
low
and
respectfully
he
took
the
object
that
lay
on
the
salver
.
it
was
the
order
of
st
.

kutiizov
had
received
the
order
of
st
.
george
of
the
first
class
and
the
emperor
showed
him
the
highest
honors
but
everyone
knew
of
the
imperial
dissatisfaction
with
him
.
the
proprieties
were
observed
and
the
emper
or
was
the
first
to
set
that
example
but
every
body
understood
that
the
old
man
was
blame
worthy
and
goodfornothing
.
when
kutiizov
conforming
to
a
custom
of
catherines
day
ordered
the
standards
that
had
been
captured
to
be
lowered
at
the
emperors
feet
on
his
en
tering
the
ballroom
the
emperor
made
a
wry
face
and
muttered
something
in
which
some
people
caught
the
words
the
old
comedian
.
the
emperors
displeasure
with
kutiizov
was
specially
increased
at
vflna
by
the
fact
that
kutiizov
evidently
could
not
or
would
not
understand
the
importance
of
the
coming
campaign
.
when
on
the
following
morning
the
em
peror
said
to
the
officers
assembled
about
him
you
have
not
only
saved
russia
you
have
saved
europe
they
all
understood
that
the
war
was
not
ended
.
kutiizov
alone
would
not
see
this
and
open
ly
expressed
his
opinion
that
no
fresh
war
could
improve
the
position
or
add
to
the
glory
of
russia
but
could
only
spoil
and
lower
the
glorious
position
that
russia
had
gained
.
he
tried
to
prove
to
the
emperor
the
impossibil
ity
of
levying
fresh
troops
spoke
of
the
hard
ships
already
endured
by
the
people
of
the
possibility
of
failure
and
so
forth
.
this
being
the
field
marshals
frame
of
mind
he
was
naturally
regarded
as
merely
a
hin
drance
and
obstacle
to
the
impending
war
.
to
avoid
unpleasant
encounters
with
the
old
man
the
natural
method
was
to
do
what
had
been
done
with
him
at
austerlitz
and
with
barclay
at
the
beginning
of
the
russian
cam
paignto
transfer
the
authority
to
the
emper
or
himself
thus
cutting
the
ground
from
under
the
commander
in
chiefs
feet
without
upset
ting
the
old
man
by
informing
him
of
the
change
.
with
this
object
his
staff
was
gradually
re
constructed
and
its
real
strength
removed
and
transferred
to
the
emperor

everyone
spoke
loudly
of

field
marshals
great
weakness
and
failing
health
.
his
health
had
to
be
bad
for
his
place
to
be
taken
away
and
given
to
another
.
and
in
war
and
peace
fact
his
health
was
poor
.
so
naturally
simply
and
gradually
just
as
he
had
come
from
turkey
to
the
treasury
in
petersburg
to
recruit
the
militia
and
then
to
the
army
when
he
was
needed
there
now
when
his
part
was
played

kutuzovs

was
taken
by
a
new
and
necessary
performer
.
the
war
of
1812
besides
its
national
signifi
cance
dear
to
every
russian
heart
was
now
to
assume
another
a
european
significance
.
the
movement
of
peoples
from
west
to
east
was
to
be
succeeded
by
a
movement
of
peoples
from
east
to
west
and
for
this
fresh
war
an
other
leader
was
necessary
having
qualities
and
views
differing
from
kutuzovs
and

chapter
xii
as
generally
happens
pierre
did
not
feel
the
full
effects
of
the
physical
privation
and
strain
he
had
suffered
as
prisoner
until
after
they
were
over
.
after
his
liberation
he
reached
orel
and
on
the
third
day
there
when
pre
paring
to
go
to
kiev
he
fell
ill
and
was
laid
up
for
three
months
.
he
had
what
the
doctors
termed
bilious
fever
.
but
despite
the
fact
that
the
doctors
treated
him
bled
him
and
gave
him
medicines
to
drink
he
recovered
.
scarcely
any
impression
was
left
on
pierres
mind
by
all
that
happened
to
him
from
the
time
of
his
rescue
till
his
illness
.
he
remem
bered
only
the
dull
gray
weather
now
rainy
and
now
snowy
internal
physical
distress
and
pains
in
his
feet
and
side
.
he
remembered
a
general
impression
of
the
misfortunes
and
sufferings
of
people
and
of
being
worried
by
the
curiosity
of
officers
and
generals
who
ques
tioned
him
he
also
remembered
his
difficulty
in
procuring
a
conveyance
and
horses
and
above
all
he
remembered
his
incapacity
to
think
and
feel
all
that
time
.
on
the
day
of
his
rescue
he
had
seen
the
body
of
ptya
rost6v
.
that
same
day
he
had
learned
that
prince
andrew
after
surviving
the
battle
of
borodin6
for
more
than
a
month
had
recently
died
in
the
rostovs
house
at
yaroslavl
and
denfsov
who
told
him
this
news
also
mentioned
heines
death
supposing
that
pierre
had
heard
of
it
long
before
.
all
this
at
the
time
seemed
merely
strange
to
pierre
he
felt
he
could
not
grasp
its
significance
.
just
then
he
was
only
anxious
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
from
places
where
people
were
killing
one
another
to
some
peaceful
refuge
where
he
could
recover
himself
rest
and
think
over
all
the
strange
new
facts
he
had
learned
but
on
reaching
orel
he
immediately
fell
ill
.
when
he
came
to
himself
after
his
illness
he
saw
in
attendance
on
him
two
of
his
servants
terenty
and
vska
who
had
come
from
moscow
and
also
his
cousin
the
eldest
princess
who
had
been
living
on
his
estate
at
elects
and
hearing
of
his
rescue
and
illness
had
come
to
look
after
him
.
it
was
only
gradually
during
his
convales
cence
that
pierre
lost
the
impressions
he
had
become
accustomed
to
during
the
last
few
months
and
got
used
to
the
idea
that
no
one
would
oblige
him
to
go
anywhere
tomorrow
that
no
one
would
deprive
him
of
his
warm
bed
and
that
he
would
be
sure
to
get
his
din
ner
tea
and
supper
.
but
for
a
long
time
in
his
dreams
he
still
saw
himself
in
the
condi
tions
of
captivity
.
in
the
same
way
little
by
little
he
came
to
understand
the
news
he
had
been
told
after
his
rescue
about
the
death
of
prince
andrew
the
death
of
his
wife
and
the
destruction
of
the
french
.
a
joyous
feeling
of
freedom
that
complete
inalienable
freedom
natural
to
man
which
he
had
first
experienced
at
the
first
halt
out
side
moscow
filled
pierres
soul
during
his
convalescence
.
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
this
inner
freedom
which
was
independent
of
external
conditions
now
had
as
it
were
an
additional
setting
of
external
liberty
.
he
was
alone
in
a
strange
town
without
acquaint
ances
.
no
one
demanded
anything
of
him
or
sent
him
anywhere
.
he
had
all
he
wanted
the
thought
of
his
wife
which
had
been
a
continual
torment
to
him
was
no
longer
there
since
she
was
no
more
.
oh
how
good
how
splendid
said
he
to
himself
when
a
cleanly
laid
table
was
moved
up
to
him
with
savory
beef
tea
or
when
he
lay
down
for
the
night
on
a
soft
clean
bed
or
when
he
remembered
that
the
french
had
gone
and
that
his
wife
was
no
more
.
oh
how
good
how
splendid
book
fifteen
631
and
by
old
habit
he
asked
himself
the
question
well
and
what
then
what
am
i
going
to
do
and
he
immediately
gave
him
self
the
answer
well
i
shall
live
.
ah
how
splendid
the
very
question
that
had
formerly
tor
mented
him
the
thing
he
had
continually
sought
to
find
the
aim
of
lifeno
longer
existed
for
him
now
.
that
search
for
the
aim
of
life
had
not
merely
disappeared
tempo
rarilyhe
felt
that
it
no
longer
existed
for
him
and
could
not
present
itself
again
.
and
this
very
absence
of
an
aim
gave
him
the
complete
joyous
sense
of
freedom
which
constituted
his
happiness
at
this
time
.
he
could
not
see
an
aim
for
he
now
had
faith
not
faith
in
any
kind
of
rule
or
words
or
ideas
but
faith
in
an
everliving
ever
manifest
god
.
formerly
he
had
sought
him
in
aims
he
set
himself
.
that
search
for
an
aim
had
been
simply
a
search
for
god
and
suddenly
in
his
captivity
he
had
learned
not
by
words
or
reasoning
but
by
direct
feeling
what
his
nurse
had
told
him
long
ago
that
god
is
here
and
everywhere
.
in
his
captivity
he
had
learned
that
in
karatdev
god
was
greater
more
infinite
and
unfathomable
than
in
the
architect
of
the
universe
recognized
by
the
freemasons
.
he
felt
like
a
man
who
after
straining
his
eyes
to
see
into
the
far
dis
tance
finds
what
he
sought
at
his
very
feet
.
all
his
life
he
had
looked
over
the
heads
of
the
men
around
him
when
he
should
have
merely
looked
in
front
of
him
without
straining
his
eyes
.
in
the
past
he
had
never
been
able
to
find
that
great
inscrutable
infinite
something
.
he
had
only
felt
that
it
must
exist
somewhere
and
had
looked
for
it
.
in
everything
near
and
com
prehensible
he
had
seen
only
what
was
limited
petty
commonplace
and
senseless
.
he
had
equipped
himself
with
a
mental
telescope
and
looked
into
remote
space
where
petty
world
liness
hiding
itself
in
misty
distance
had
seem
ed
to
him
great
and
infinite
merely
because
it
was
not
clearly
seen
.
and
such
had
european
life
politics
freemasonry
philosophy
and
philanthropy
seemed
to
him
.
but
even
then
at
moments
of
weakness
as
he
had
accounted
them
his
mind
had
penetrated
to
those
dis
tances
and
he
had
there
seen
the
same
petti
ness
worldliness
and
senselessness
.
now
how
ever
he
had
learned
to
see
the
great
eternal
and
infinite
in
everything
and
therefore
to
see
it
and
enjoy
its
contemplation
he
natu
rally
threw
away
the
telescope
through
which
he
had
till
now
gazed
over
mens
heads
and
gladly
regarded
the
everchanging
eternally
great
unfathomable
and
infinite
life
around
him
.
and
the
closer
he
looked
the
more
tran
quil
and
happy
he
became
.
that
dreadful
ques
tion
what
for
which
had
formerly
destroyed
all
his
mental
edifices
no
longer
existed
for
him
.
to
that
question
what
for
a
simple
answer
was
now
always
ready
in
his
soul
be
cause
there
is
a
god
that
god
without
whose
will
not
one
hair
falls
from
a
mans
head
.
chapter
xiii
in
external
ways
pierre
had
hardly
changed
at
all
.
in
appearance
he
was
just
what
he
used
to
be
.
as
before
he
was
absentminded
and
seemed
occupied
not
with
what
was
before
his
eyes
but
with
something
special
of
his
own
.
the
difference
between
his
former
and
present
self
was
that
formerly
when
he
did
not
grasp
what
lay
before
him
or
was
said
to
him
he
had
puckered
his
forehead
painfully
as
if
vainly
seeking
to
distinguish
something
at
a
distance
.
at
present
he
still
forgot
what
was
said
to
him
and
still
did
not
see
what
was
before
his
eyes
but
he
now
looked
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
and
seemingly
ironic
smile
at
what
was
before
him
and
listened
to
what
was
said
though
evidently
seeing
and
hearing
something
quite
different
.
formerly
he
had
appeared
to
be
a
kindhearted
but
unhappy
man
and
so
people
had
been
inclined
to
avoid
him
.
now
a
smile
at
the
joy
of
life
always
played
round
his
lips
and
sympathy
for
others
shone
in
his
eyes
with
a
questioning
look
as
to
whether
they
were
as
contented
as
he
was
and
people
felt
pleased
by
his
presence
.
previously
he
had
talked
a
great
deal
grew
excited
when
he
talked
and
seldom
listened
now
he
was
seldom
carried
away
in
conversa
tion
and
knew
how
to
listen
so
that
people
readily
told
him
their
most
intimate
secrets
.
the
princess
who
had
never
liked
pierre
and
had
been
particularly
hostile
to
him
since
she
had
felt
herself
under
obligations
to
him
after
the
old
counts
death
now
after
staying
a
short
time
in
orel
where
she
had
come
in
tending
to
show
pierre
that
in
spite
of
his
in
gratitude
she
considered
it
her
duty
to
nurse
him
felt
to
her
surprise
and
vexation
that
she
had
become
fond
of
him
.
pierre
did
not
in
any
way
seek
her
approval
he
merely
studied
her
with
interest
.
formerly
she
had
felt
that
he
regarded
her
with
indifference
and
irony
and
so
had
shrunk
into
herself
as
she
did
with
others
and
had
shown
him
only
the
combative
war
and
peace
side
of
her
nature
but
now
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
understand
the
most
intimate
places
of
her
heart
and
mistrustfully
at
first
but
afterwards
gratefully
she
let
him
see
the
hid
den
kindly
sides
of
her
character
.
the
most
cunning
man
could
not
have
crept
into
her
confidence
more
successfully
evoking
memories
of
the
best
times
of
her
youth
and
showing
sympathy
with
them
.
yet
pierres
cunning
consisted
simply
in
finding
pleasure
in
drawing
out
the
human
qualities
of
the
embittered
hard
and
in
her
own
way
proud
princess
.
yes
he
is
a
very
very
kind
man
when
he
is
not
under
the
influence
of
bad
people
but
of
people
such
as
myself
thought
she
.
his
servants
too
ternty
and
vdska
in
their
own
way
noticed
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
pierre
.
they
considered
that
he
had
become
much
simpler
.
ternty
when
he
had
helped
him
undress
and
wished
him
good
night
often
lingered
with
his
masters
boots
in
his
hands
and
clothes
over
his
arm
to
see
whether
he
would
not
start
a
talk
.
and
pierre
noticing
that
ternty
wanted
a
chat
generally
kept
him
there
.
well
tell
me

..
.
now
how
did
you
get
food
he
would
ask
.
and
ternty
would
begin
talking
of
the
destruction
of
moscow
and
of
the
old
count
and
would
stand
for
a
long
time
holding
the
clothes
and
talking
or
sometimes
listening
to
pierres
stories
and
then
would
go
out
into
the
hall
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
intimacy
with
his
master
and
affection
for
him
.
the
doctor
who
attended
pierre
and
visited
him
every
day
though
he
considered
it
his
duty
as
a
doctor
to
pose
as
a
man
whose
every
moment
was
of
value
to
suffering
humanity
would
sit
for
hours
with
pierre
telling
him
his
favorite
anecdotes
and
his
observations
on
the
characters
of
his
patients
in
general
and
especially
of
the
ladies
.
its
a
pleasure
to
talk
to
a
man
like
that
he
is
not
like
our
provincials
he
would
say
.
there
were
several
prisoners
from
the
french
army
in
orel
and
the
doctor
brought
one
of
them
a
young
italian
to
see
pierre
.
this
officer
began
visiting
pierre
and
the
princess
used
to
make
fun
of
the
tenderness
the
italian
expressed
for
him
.
the
italian
seemed
happy
only
when
he
could
come
to
see
pierre
talk
with
him
tell
him
about
his
past
his
life
at
home
and
his
love
and
pour
out
to
him
his
indignation
against
the
french
and
especially
against
na
poleon
.
if
all
russians
are
in
the
least
like
you
it
is
sacrilege
to
fight
such
a
nation
he
said
to
pierre
.
you
who
have
suffered
so
from
the
french
do
not
even
feel
animosity
toward
them
.
pierre
had
evoked
the
passionate
affection
of
the
italian
merely
by
evoking
the
best
side
of
his
nature
and
taking
a
pleasure
in
so
do
ing
.
during
the
last
days
of
pierres
stay
in
orel
his
old
masonic
acqaintance
count
willarski
who
had
introduced
him
to
the
lodge
in
1807
came
to
see
him
.
willarski
was
married
to
a
russian
heiress
who
had
a
large
estate
in
orel
province
and
he
occupied
a
temporary
post
in
the
commissariat
department
in
that
town
.
hearing
that
beziikhov
was
in
orel
will
arski
though
they
had
never
been
intimate
came
to
him
with
the
professions
of
friendship
and
intimacy
that
people
who
meet
in
a
desert
generally
express
for
one
another
.
willarski
felt
dull
in
orel
and
was
pleased
to
meet
a
man
of
his
own
circle
and
as
he
supposed
of
similar
interests
.
but
to
his
surprise
willarski
soon
noticed
that
pierre
had
lagged
much
behind
the
times
and
had
sunk
as
he
expressed
it
to
himself
into
apathy
and
egotism
.
you
are
letting
yourself
go
my
dear
fel
low
he
said
.
but
for
all
that
willarski
found
it
pleasanter
now
than
it
had
been
formerly
to
be
with
pierre
and
came
to
see
him
every
day
.
to
pierre
as
he
looked
at
and
listened
to
willar
ski
it
seemed
strange
to
think
that
he
had
been
like
that
himself
but
a
short
time
before
.
willarski
was
a
married
man
with
a
family
busy
with
his
family
affairs
his
wifes
affairs
and
his
official
duties
.
he
regarded
all
these
occupations
as
hindrances
to
life
and
consid
ered
that
they
were
all
contemptible
because
their
aim
was
the
welfare
of
himself
and
his
family
.
military
administrative
political
and
masonic
interests
continually
absorbed
his
attention
.
and
pierre
without
trying
to
change
the
others
views
and
without
condemning
him
but
with
the
quiet
joyful
and
amused
smile
now
habitual
to
him
was
interested
in
this
strange
though
very
familiar
phenomenon
.
there
was
a
new
feature
in
pierres
rela
tions
with
willarski
with
the
princess
with
the
doctor
and
with
all
the
people
he
now
met
which
gained
for
him
the
general
good
will
.
this
was
his
acknowledgment
of
the
im
book
fifteen
possibility
of
changing
a
mans
convictions
by
words
and
his
recognition
of
the
possibility
of
everyone
thinking
feeling
and
seeing
things
each
from
his
own
point
of
view
.
this
legitimate
peculiarity
of
.
each
individual
which
used
to
excite
and
irritate
pierre
now
became
a
basis
of
the
sympathy
he
felt
for
and
the
interest
he
took
in
other
people
.
the
differ
ence
and
sometimes
complete
contradiction
between
mens
opinions
and
their
lives
and
be
tween
one
man
and
another
pleased
him
and
drew
from
him
an
amused
and
gentle
smile
.
in
practical
matters
pierre
unexpectedly
felt
within
himself
a
center
of
gravity
he
had
pre
viously
lacked
.
formerly
all
pecuniary
ques
tions
especially
requests
for
money
to
which
as
an
extremely
wealthy
man
he
was
very
fre
quently
exposed
produced
in
him
a
state
of
hopeless
agitation
and
perplexity
.
to
give
or
not
to
give
he
had
asked
himself
.
i
have
it
and
he
needs
it
.
but
someone
else
needs
it
still
more
.
who
needs
it
most
and
perhaps
they
are
both
impostors
in
the
old
days
he
had
been
unable
to
find
a
way
out
of
all
these
sur
mises
and
had
given
to
all
who
asked
as
long
as
he
had
anything
to
give
.
formerly
he
had
been
in
a
similar
state
of
perplexity
with
re
gard
to
every
question
concerning
his
property
when
one
person
advised
one
thing
and
an
other
something
else
.
now
to
his
surprise
he
found
that
he
no
longer
felt
either
doubt
or
perplexity
about
these
questions
.
there
was
now
within
him
a
judge
who
by
some
rule
unknown
to
him
decided
what
should
or
should
not
be
done
.
he
was
as
indifferent
as
heretofore
to
money
matters
but
now
he
felt
certain
of
what
ought
and
what
ought
not
to
be
done
.
the
first
time
he
had
recourse
to
his
new
judge
was
when
a
french
prisoner
a
colonel
came
to
him
and
after
talking
a
great
deal
about
his
exploits
concluded
by
making
what
amounted
to
a
demand
that
pierre
should
give
him
four
thousand
francs
to
send
to
his
wife
and
chil
dren
.
pierre
refused
without
the
least
difficulty
or
effort
and
was
afterwards
surprised
how
simple
and
easy
had
been
what
used
to
ap
pear
so
insurmountably
difficult
.
at
the
same
time
that
he
refused
the
colonels
demand
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
have
recourse
to
artifice
when
leaving
orel
to
induce
the
italian
officer
to
accept
some
money
of
which
he
was
evidently
in
need
.
a
further
proof
to
pierre
of
his
own
more
settled
outlook
on
practical
matters
was
furnished
by
his
decision
with
regard
to
his
wifes
debts
and
to
the
re
633
building
of
his
houses
in
and
near
moscow
.
his
head
steward
came
to
him
at
orel
and
pierre
reckoned
up
with
him
his
diminished
income
.
the
burning
of
moscow
had
cost
him
according
to
the
head
stewards
calculation
about
two
million
rubles
.
to
console
pierre
for
these
losses
the
head
steward
gave
him
an
estimate
showing
that
despite
these
losses
his
income
would
not
be
diminished
but
would
even
be
increased
if
he
refused
to
pay
his
wifes
debts
which
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
meet
and
did
not
re
build
his
moscow
house
and
the
country
house
on
his
moscow
estate
which
had
cost
him
eighty
thousand
rubles
a
year
and
brought
in
nothing
.
yes
of
course
thats
true
said
pierre
with
a
cheerful
smile
.
i
dont
need
all
that
at
all
.
by
being
ruined
i
have
become
much
richer
.
but
in
january
savlich
came
from
moscow
and
gave
him
an
account
of
the
state
of
things
there
and
spoke
of
the
estimate
an
architect
had
made
of
the
cost
of
rebuilding
the
town
and
country
houses
speaking
of
this
as
of
a
set
tled
matter
.
about
the
same
time
he
received
letters
from
prince
vasili
and
other
peters
burg
acquaintancesspeakingof
his
wifesdebts
.
and
pierre
decided
that
the
stewards
pro
posals
which
had
so
pleased
him
were
wrong
and
that
he
must
go
to
petersburg
and
settle
his
wifes
affairs
and
must
rebuild
in
moscow
.
why
this
was
necessary
he
did
not
know
but
he
knew
for
certain
that
it
was
necessary
.
his
income
would
be
reduced
by
three
fourths
but
he
felt
it
must
be
done
.
willarski
was
going
to
moscow
and
they
agreed
to
travel
together
.
during
the
whole
time
of
his
convalescence
in
orel
pierre
had
experienced
a
feeling
of
joy
freedom
and
life
but
when
during
his
journey
he
found
himself
in
the
open
world
and
saw
hundreds
of
new
faces
that
feeling
was
intensified
.
throughout
his
journey
he
felt
like
a
schoolboy
on
holiday
.
everyone
the
stagecoach
driver
the
posthouse
overseers
the
peasants
on
the
roads
and
in
the
villages
had
a
new
significance
for
him
.
the
presence
and
remarks
of
willarski
who
continually
de
plored
the
ignorance
and
poverty
of
russia
and
its
backwardness
compared
with
europe
only
heightened
pierres
pleasure
.
where
will
arski

pierre
saw
an
extraordinary
strength
and
vitality
the
strength
which
in
that
vast
space
amid
the
snows
maintained
the
life
of
this
original
peculiar
and
unique
peo
ple
.
he
did
not
contradict
willarski
and
even
634
seemed
to
agree
with
himan
apparent

ment

the
simplest
way
to
avoid

and

it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
why
and
whither
ants
whose
heap
has
been
destroyed
are
hurry
ing
some
from
the
heap
dragging
bits
of
rub
bish
larvae
and
corpses
others
back
to
the
heap
or
why
they
jostle

one
another
and
fight
and
it
would
be
equally
difficult
to
explain
what
caused
the
russians
after
the
departure
of
the
french
to
throng
to
the
place
that
had
formerly
been
moscow
.
but
when
we
watch
the
ants
round
their
ruined
heap
the
tenacity
energy
and
immense
number
of
the
delving
insects
prove
that
despite
the
destruc
tion
of
the
heap
something
indestructible
which
though
intangible
is
the
real
strength
of
the
colony
still
exists
and
similarly
though
in
moscow
in
the
month
of
october
there
was
no
government
and
no
churches
shrines
riches
or
housesit
was
still
the
moscow
it
had
been
in
august
.
all
was
destroyed
except
something
intangible
yet
powerful
and
indestructible
.
the
motives
of
those
who
thronged
from
all
sides
to
moscow
after
it
had
been
cleared
of
the
enemy
were
most
diverse
and
personal
and
at
first
for
the
most
part
savage
and
brutal
.
one
motive
only
they
all
had
in
common
a
desire
to
get
to
the
place
that
had
been
called
moscow
to
apply
their
activities
there
.
within
a
week
moscow
already
had
fifteen
thousand
inhabitants
in
a
fortnight
twenty
five
thousand
and
so
on
.
by
the
autumn
of
1813
the
number
ever
increasing
and
increas
ing
exceeded
what
it
had
been
in
1812
.
the
first
russians
to
enter
moscow
were
the
cossacks
of
wintingerodes
detachment
peasants
from
the
adjacent
villages
and
resi
dents
who
had
fled
from
moscow
and
had
been
hiding
in
its
vicinity
.
the
russians
who
en
tered
moscow
finding
it
plundered
plundered
it
in
their
turn
.
they
continued
what
the
french
had
begun
.
trains
of
peasant
carts
came
to
moscow
to
carry
off
to
the
villages
what
had
been
abandoned
in
the
ruined
houses
and
the
streets
.
the
cossacks
carried
off
what
they
could
to
their
camps
and
the
householders
seized
all
they
could
find
in
other
houses
and
moved
it
to
their
own
pretending
that
it
was
their
property
.
but
the
first
plunderers
were
followed
by
a
second
and
a
third
contingent
and
with
in
creasing
numbers
plundering
became
more
the
french
found
moscow
abandoned
but
with
all
the
organizations
of
regular
life
with
diverse
branches
of
commerce
and
craftsman
ship
with
luxury
and
governmental
and
re
ligious
institutions
.
these
forms
were
lifeless
but
still
existed
.
there
were
bazaars
shops
warehouses
market
stalls
granaries
for
the
most
part
still
stocked
with
goods
and
there
were
factories
and
workshops
palaces
and
wealthy
houses
filled
with
luxuries
hospitals
prisons
government
offices
churches
and
cathedrals
.
the
longer
the
french
remained
the
more
these
forms
of
town
life
perished
until
finally
all
was
merged
into
one
confused
lifeless
scene
of
plunder
.
the
more
the
plundering
by
the
french
con
tinued
the
more
both
the
wealth
of
moscow
and
the
strength
of
its
plunderers
was
de
stroyed
.
but
plundering
by
the
russians
with
which
the
reoccupation
of
the
city
began
had
an
opposite
effect
the
longer
it
continued
and
the
greater
the
number
of
people
taking
part
in
it
the
more
rapidly
was
the
wealth
of
the
city
and
its
regular
life
restored
.
besides
the
plunderers
very
various
people
some
drawn
by
curiosity
some
by
official
duties
some
by
selfinteresthouse
owners
clergy
officials
of
all
kinds
tradesmen
artisans
and
peasants
streamed
in
to
moscow
as
blood
flows
to
the
heart
.
within
a
week
the
peasants
who
came
with
empty
carts
to
carry
off
plunder
were
stopped
by
the
authorities
and
made
to
cart
the
corpses
out
of
the
town
.
other
peasants
having
heard
of
their
comrades
discomfiture
came
to
town
bringing
rye
oats
and
hay
and
beat
down
one
anothers
prices
to
below
what
they
had
been
in
former
days
.
gangs
of
carpenters
hop
ing
for
high
pay
arrived
in
moscow
every
day
and
on
all
sides
logs
were
being
hewn
new
houses
built
and
old
charred
ones
repaired
.
tradesmen
began
trading
in
booths
.
cook
shops
and
taverns
were
opened
in
partially
burned
houses
.
the
clergy
resumed
the
serv
ices
in
many
churches
that
had
not
been
burn
ed

donors
contributed
church
property
that
had
been
stolen
.
government
clerks
set
up
their
baizecovered
tables
and
their
pigeon
holes
of
documents
in
small
rooms
.
the
higher
authorities
and
the
police
organized
the
dis
tribution
of
goods
left
behind
by
the
french
.
the
owners
of
houses
in
which
much
property
had
been
left
brought
there
from
other
houses
complained
of
the
injustice
of
taking
every
book
fifteen
635
thing
to
the
faceted
palace
in
the
kremlin
others
insisted
that
as
the
french
had
gathered
things
from
different
houses
into
this
or
that
house
it
would
be
unfair
to
allow
its
owner
to
keep
all
that
was
found
there
.
they
abused
the
police
and
bribed

chapter
xv
at
the
end
of
january
pierre
went
to
moscow
and
stayed
in
an
annex
of
his
house
which
had
not
been
burned
.
he
called
on
count
ros
topchfn
and
on
some
acquaintances
who
were
back
in
moscow
and
he
intended
to
leave
for
petersburg
two
days
later
.
everybody
was
cele
brating
the
victory
everything
was
bubbling
with
life
in
the
ruined
but
reviving
city
.
every
one
was
pleased
to
see
pierre
everyone
wished
to
meet
him
and
everyone
questioned
him
about
what
he
had
seen
.
pierre
felt
particularly
well
disposed
toward
them
all
but
was
now
instinctively
on
his
guard
for
fear
of
binding
himself
in
any
way
.
to
all
questions
put
to
himwhether
important
or
quite
trifling
such
as
where
would
he
live
was
he
going
to
re
build
when
was
he
going
to
petersburg
and
would
he
mind
taking
a
parcel
for
someone
he
replied
yes
perhaps
or
i
think
so
and
so
on
.
he
had
heard
that
the
rost6vs
were
at
kos
tromd
but
the
thought
of
natasha
seldom
occurred
to
him
.
if
it
did
it
was
only
as
a
pleas
ant
memory
of
the
distant
past
.
he
felt
him
self
not
only
free
from
social
obligations
but
also
from
that
feeling
which
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
aroused
in
himself
.
on
the
third
day
after
his
arrival
he
heard
from
the
drubetsk6ys
that
princess
mary
was
in
moscow
.
the
death
sufferings
and
last
days
of
prince
andrew
had
often
occupied
pierres
thoughts
and
now
recurred
to
him
with
fresh
vividness
.
having
heard
at
dinner
that
prin
cess
mary
was
in
moscow
and
living
in
her
house
which
had
not
been
burned
in
voz
dvizhenka
street
he
drove
that
same
evening
to
see
her
.
on
his
way
to
the
house
pierre
kept
think
ing
of
prince
andrew
of
their
friendship
of
his
various
meetings
with
him
and
especially
of
the
last
one
at
borodin6
.
is
it
possible
that
he
died
in
the
bitter
frame
of
mind
he
was
then
in
is
it
possible
that
the
meaning
of
life
was
not
disclosed
to
him
be
fore
he
died
thought
pierre
.
he
recalled
karataev
and
his
death
and
involuntarily
be
gan
to
compare
these
two
men
so
different
and
yet
so
similar
in
that
they
had
both
lived
and
both
died
and
in
the
love
he
felt
for
both
of
them
.
pierre
drove
up
to
the
house
of
the
old
prince
in
a
most
serious
mood
.
the
house
had
escaped
the
fire
it
showed
signs
of
damage
but
its
general
aspect
was
unchanged
.
the
old
foot
man
who
met
pierre
with
a
stern
face
as
if
wishing
to
make
the
visitor
feel
that
the
ab
sence
of
the
old
prince
had
not
disturbed
the
order
of
things
in
the
house
informed
him
that
the
princess
had
gone
to
her
own
apart
ments
and
that
she
received
on
sundays
.
announce
me
.
perhaps
she
will
see
me
said
pierre
.
yes
sir
said
the
man
.
please
step
into
the
portrait
gallery
.
a
few
minutes
later
the
footman
returned
with
dessalles
who
brought
word
from
the
princess
that
she
would
be
very
glad
to
see
pierre
if
he
would
excuse
her
want
of
cere
mony
and
come
upstairs
to
her
apartment
.
in
a
rather
low
room
lit
by
one
candle
sat
the
princess
and
with
her
another
person
dressed
in
black
.
pierre
remembered
that
the
princess
always
had
lady
companions
but
who
they
were
and
what
they
were
like
he
never
knew
or
remembered
.
this
must
be
one
of
her
companions
he
thought
glancing
at
the
lady
in
the
black
dress
.
the
princess
rose
quickly
to
meet
him
and
held
out
her
hand
.
yes
she
said
looking
at
his
altered
face
after
he
had
kissed
her
hand
so
this
is
how
we
meet
again
.
he
often
spoke
of
you
even
at
the
very
last
she
went
on
turning
her
eyes
from
pierre
to
her
companion
with
a
shyness
that
surprised
him
for
an
instant
.
i
was
so
glad
to
hear
of
your
safety
.
it
was
the
first
piece
of
good
news
we
had
received
for
a
long
time
.
again
the
princess
glanced
round
at
her
companion
with
even
more
uneasiness
in
her
manner
and
was
about
to
add
something
but
pierre
interrupted
her
.
just
imagine
i
knew
nothing
about
him
said
he
.
i
thought
he
had
been
killed
.
all
i
know
i
heard
at
second
hand
from
others
.
i
only
know
that
he
fell
in
with
the
rost6vs
.

.

.

.
what
a
strange
coincidence
1
pierre
spoke
rapidly
and
with
animation
.
he
glanced
once
at
the
companions
face
saw
her
attentive
and
kindly
gaze
fixed
on
him

war
and
peace
as
often
happens
when
one
is
talking
felt
somehow
that
this
companion
in
the
black
dress
was
a
good
kind
excellent
creature
who
would
not
hinder
his
conversing
freely
with
princess
mary
.
but
when
he
mentioned
the
rost6vs
prin
cess
marys
face
expressed
still
greater
embar
rassment
.
she
again
glanced
rapidly
from
pierres
face
to
that
of
the
lady
in
the
black
dress
and
saidt
do
you
really
not
recognize
her
pierre
looked
again
at
the
companions
pale
delicate
face
with
its
black
eyes
and
peculiar
mouth
and
something
near
to
him
long
for
gotten
and
more
than
sweet
looked
at
him
from
those
attentive
eyes
.
but
no
it
cant
be
he
thought
.
this
stern
thin
pale
face
that
looks
so
much
older
it
cannot
be
she
.
it
merely
reminds
me
of
her
.
but
at
that
moment
princess
mary
said
natd
sha
and
with
difficulty
effort
and
stress
like
the
opening
of
a
door
grown
rusty
on
its
hinges
a
smile
appeared
on
the
face
with
the
atten
tive
eyes
and
from
that
opening
door
came
a
breath
of
fragrance
which
suffused
pierre
with
a
happiness
he
had
long
forgotten
and
of
which
he
had
not
even
been
thinking
especially
at
that
moment
.
it
suffused
him
seized
him
and
enveloped
him
completely
.
when
she
smiled
doubt
was
no
longer
possible
it
was
natasha
and
he
loved
her
.
at
that
moment
pierre
involuntarily
be
trayed
to
her
to
princess
mary
and
above
all
to
himself
a
secret
of
which
he
himself
had
been
unaware
.
he
flushed
joyfully
yet
with
painful
distress
.
he
tried
to
hide
his
agitation
.
but
the
more
he
tried
to
hide
it
the
more
clearly
clearer
than
any
words
could
have
donedid
he
betray
to
himself
to
her
and
to
princess
mary
that
he
loved
her
.
no
its
only
the
unexpectedness
of
it
thought
pierre
.
but
as
soon
as
he
tried
to
con
tinue
the
conversation
he
had
begun
with
princess
mary
he
again
glanced
at
natasha
and
a
stilldeeper
flush
suffused
his
face
and
a
stillstronger
agitation
of
mingled
joy
and
fear
seized
his
soul
.
he
became
confused
in
his
speech
and
stopped
in
the
middle
of
what
he
was
saying
.
pierre
had
failed
to
notice
natasha
because
he
did
not
at
all
expect
to
see
her
there
but
he
had
failed
to
recognize
her
because
the
change
in
her
since
he
last
saw
her
was
immense
.
she
had
grown
thin
and
pale
but
that
was
not
what
made
her
unrecognizable
she
was
un
recognizable
at
the
moment
he
entered
because
on
that
face
whose
eyes
had
always
shone
with
a
suppressed
smile
of
the
joy
of
life
now
when
he
first
entered
and
glanced
at
her
there
was
not
the
least
shadow
of
a
smile
only
her
eyes
were
kindly
attentive
and
sadly
interrogative
.
pierres
confusion
was
not
reflected
by
any
confusion
on
natdshas
part
but
only
by
the
pleasure
that
just
perceptibly
lit
up
her
whole
face
.
chapter
xvi
she
has
come
to
stay
with
me
said
princess
mary
.
the
count
and
countess
will
be
here
in
a
few
days
.
the
countess
is
in
a
dreadful
state
but
it
was
necessary
for
natasha
herself
to
see
a
doctor
.
they
insisted
on
her
coming
with
me
.
yes
is
there
a
family
free
from
sorrow
now
said
pierre
addressing
natdsha
.
you
know
it
happened
the
very
day
we
were
rescued
.
i
saw
him
.
what
a
delightful
boy
he
was
natdsha
looked
at
him
and
by
way
of
an
swer
to
his
words
her
eyes
widened
and
lit
up
.
what
can
one
say
or
think
of
as
a
consola
tion
said
pierre
.
nothing
why
had
such
a
splendid
boy
so
full
of
life
to
die
ys
in
these
days
it
would
be
hard
to
live
without
faith

.

.

.
remarked
princess
mary
.
yes
yes
that
is
really
true
pierre
hastily
interrupted
her
.
why
is
it
true
natdsha
asked
looking
at
tentively
into
pierres
eyes
.
how
can
you
ask
why
said
princess
mary
.
the
thought
alone
of
what
awaits

.

.

.
natdsha
without
waiting
for
princess
mary
to
finish
again
looked
inquiringly
at
pierre
.
and
because
pierre
continued
only
one
who
believes
that
there
is
a
god
ruling
us
can
bear
a
loss
such
as
hers
and

.

.

.
yours
.
natdsha
had
already
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
but
suddenly
stopped
.
pierre
hurriedly
turned
away
from
her
and
again
addressed
princess
mary
asking
about
his
friends
last
days
.
pierres
confusion
had
now
almost
vanished
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
that
his
freedom
had
also
completely
gone
.
he
felt
that
there
was
now
a
judge
of
his
every
word
and
action
whose
judgment
mattered
more
to
him
than
that
of
all
the
rest
of
the
world
.
as
he
spoke
now
he
was
considering
what
impression
his
words
would
make
on
natdsha
.
he
did
not
purposely
say
things
to
please
her
but
what
ever
he
was
saying
he
regarded
from
her
stand
point
.
princess
mary
reluctantly
as
is
usual
in
such
book
fifteen
cases
began
telling
of
the
condition
in
which
she
had
found
prince
andrew
.
but
pierres
face
quivering
with
emotion
his
questions
and
his
eager
restless
expression
gradually
com
pelled
her
to
go
into
details
which
she
feared
to
recall
for
her
own
sake
.
yes
yes
and
so

..
.

pierre
kept
saying
as
he
leaned
toward
her
with
his
whole
body
and
eagerly
listened
to
her
story
.
yes
yes

..
.
so
he
grew
tranquil
and
softened
with
all
his
soul
he
had
always
sought
one
thing
to
be
perfectly
good
so
he
could
not
be
afraid
of
death
.
the
faults
he
had
if
he
had
any
were
not
of
his
making
.
so
he
did
soften

.

.

.
what
a
happy
thing
that
he
saw
you
again
he
added
suddenly
turning
to
natasha
and
looking
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
tears
.
natashas
face
twitched
.
she
frowned
and
lowered
her
eyes
for
a
moment
.
she
hesitated
for
an
instant
whether
to
speak
or
not
.
yes
that
was
happiness
she
then
said
in
her
quiet
voice
with
its
deep
chest
notes
.
for
me
it
certainly
was
happiness
.
she
paused
.
and
he

..
.
he

..
.
he
said
he
was
wishing
for
it
at
the
very
moment
i
entered
the
room
.

.

.

.
natdshas
voice
broke
.
she
blushed
pressed
her
clasped
hands
on
her
knees
and
then
con
trolling
herself
with
an
evident
effort
lifted
her
head
and
began
to
speak
rapidly
.
we
knew
nothing
of
it
when
we
started
from
moscow
.
i
did
not
dare
to
ask
about
him
.
then
suddenly
s6nya
told
me
he
was
traveling
with
us
.
i
had
no
idea
and
could
not
imagine
what
state
he
was
in
all
i
wanted
was
to
see
him
and
be
with
him
she
said
trembling
and
breathing
quickly
.
and
not
letting
them
interrupt
her
she
went
on
to
tell
what
she
had
never
yet
mentioned
to
anyone
all
she
had
lived
through
during
those
three
weeks
of
their
journey
and
life
at
yarosldvl
.
pierre
listened
to
her
with
lips
parted
and
eyes
fixed
upon
her
full
of
tears
.
as
he
listened
he
did
not
think
of
prince
andrew
nor
of
death
nor
of
what
she
was
telling
.
he
listened
to
her
and
felt
only
pity
for
her
for
what
she
was
suffering
now
while
she
was
speaking
.
princess
mary
frowning
in
her
effort
to
hold
back
her
tears
sat
beside
natdsha
and
heard
for
the
first
time
the
story
of
those
last
days
of
her
brothers
and
natdshas
love
.
evidently
natdsha
needed
to
tell
that
pain
ful
yet
joyful
tale
.
she
spoke
mingling
most
trifling
details
with
the
intimate
secrets
of
her
soul
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
never
finish
.
several
637
times
she
repeated
the
same
thing
twice
.
dessalles
voice
was
heard
outside
the
door
asking
whether
little
nicholas
might
come
in
to
say
good
night
.
well
thats
all
everything
said
natdsha
.
she
got
up
quickly
just
as
nicholas
entered
almost
ran
to
the
door
which
was
hidden
by
curtains
struck
her
head
against
it
and
rushed
from
the
room
with
a
moan
either
of
pain
or
sorrow
.
pierre
gazed
at
the
door
through
which
she
had
disappeared
and
did
not
understand
why
he
suddenly
feltall
alone
in
the
world
.
princess
mary
roused
him
from
his
abstrac
tion
by
drawing
his
attentioa
to
her
nephew
who
had
entered
the
room
.
at
that
moment
of
emotional
tenderness
young
nicholas
face
which
resembled
his
fathers
affected
pierre
so
much
that
when
he
had
kissed
the
boy
he
got
up
quickly
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
went
to
the
window
.
he
wished
to
take
leave
of
princess
mary
but
she
would
not
let
him
go
.
no
natdsha
and
i
sometimes
dont
go
to
sleep
till
after
two
so
please
dont
go
.
i
will
order
supper
.
go
downstairs
we
will
come
im
mediately
.
before
pierre
left
the
room
princess
mary
told
him
this
is
the
first
time
she
has
talked
of
him
like
that
.
chapter
xvii
pierre
was
shown
into
the
large
brightly
lit
dining
room
a
few
minutes
later
he
heard
footsteps
and
princess
mary
entered
with
natdsha
.
natdsha
was
calm
though
a
severe
and
grave
expression
had
again
settled
on
her
face
.
they
all
three
of
them
now
experienced
that
feeling
of
awkwardness
which
usually
fol
lows
after
a
serious
and
heartfelt
talk
.
it
is
im
possible
to
go
back
to
the
same
conversation
to
talk
of
trifles
is
awkward
and
yet
the
desire
to
speak
is
there
and
silence
seems
like
affecta
tion
.
they
went
silently
to
table
.
the
foot
men
drew
back
the
chairs
and
pushed
them
up
again
.
pierre
unfolded
his
cold
table
napkin
and
resolving
to
break
the
silence
looked
at
natdsha
and
at
princess
mary
.
they
had
evi
dently
both
formed
the
same
resolution
the
eyes
of
both
shone
with
satisfaction
and
a
con
fession
that
besides
sorrow
life
also
has
joy
.
do
you
take
vodka
count
asked
princess
mary
and
those
words
suddenly
banished
the
shadows
of
the
past
now
tell
us
about
your
self
said
she
.
one
hears
such
improbable
wonders
about
you
638
war
and
peace
yes
replied
pierre
with
the
smile
of
mild
irony
now
habitual
to
him
.
they
even
tell
me
wonders
i
myself
never
dreamed
of
1
mary
abrdmovna
invited
me
to
her
house
and
kept
telling
me
what
had
happened
or
ought
to
have
happened
to
me
.
stepan
stepanych
also
instructed
me
how
i
ought
to
tell
of
my
expe
riences
.
in
general
i
have
noticed
that
it
is
very
easy
to
be
an
interesting
man
i
am
an
in
teresting
man
now
people
invite
me
out
and
tell
me
all
about
myself
.
natasha
smiled
and
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
.
we
have
been
told
princess
mary
inter
rupted
her
that
you
lost
two
millions
in
moscow
.
is
that
true
but
i
am
three
times
as
rich
as
before
re
turned
pierre
.
though
the
position
was
now
altered
by
his
decision
to
pay
his
wifes
debts
and
to
rebuild
his
houses
pierre
still
maintained
that
he
had
become
three
times
as
rich
as
before
.
what
i
have
certainly
gained
is
freedom
he
began
seriously
but
did
not
continue
no
ticing
that
this
theme
was
too
egotistic
.
and
are
you
building
yes
.
savelich
says
i
must
tell
me
you
did
not
know
of
the
countess
death
when
you
decided
to
remain
in
mos
cow
asked
princess
mary
and
immediately
blushed
noticing
that
her
question
following
his
mention
of
freedom
ascribed
to
his
words
a
meaning
he
had
perhaps
not
intended
.
no
answered
pierre
evidently
not
con
sidering
awkward
the
meaning
princess
mary
had
given
to
his
words
.
i
heard
of
it
in
orel
and
you
cannot
imagine
how
it
shocked
me
.
we
were
not
an
exemplary
couple
he
added
quickly
glancing
at
natdsha
and
noticing
on
her
face
curiosity
as
to
how
he
would
speak
of
his
wife
but
her
death
shocked
me
terribly
.
when
two
people
quarrel
they
are
always
both
in
fault
and
ones
own
guilt
suddenly
becomes
terribly
serious
when
the
other
is
no
longer
alive
.
and
then
such
a
death

.

.

.
without
friends
and
without
consolation
i
am
very
very
sorry
for
her
he
concluded
and
was
pleased
to
no
tice
a
look
of
glad
approval
on
natashas
face
.
yes
and
so
you
are
once
more
an
eligible
bachelor
said
princess
mary
.
pierre
suddenly
flushed
crimson
and
for
a
long
time
tried
not
to
look
at
natdsha
.
when
he
ventured
to
glance
her
way
again
her
face
was
cold
stern
and
he
fancied
even
con
temptuous
.
and
did
you
really
see
and
speak
to
na
poleon
as
we
have
been
told
said
princess
mary
.
pierre
laughed
.
no
not
oncel
everybody
seems
to
imagine
that
being
taken
prisoner
means
being
napo
leons
guest
.
not
only
did
i
never
see
him
but
i
heard
nothing
about
himi
was
in
much
lower
company
supper
was
over
and
pierre
who
at
first
de
clined
to
speak
about
his
captivity
was
gradu
ally
led
on
to
do
so
.
but
its
true
that
you
remained
in
moscow
to
kill
napoleon
natdsha
asked
with
a
slight
smile
.
i
guessed
it
then
when
we
met
at
the
sukharev
tower
do
you
remember
pierre
admitted
that
it
was
true
and
from
that
was
gradually
led
by
princess
marys
ques
tions
and
especially
by
natashas
into
giving
a
detailed
account
of
his
adventures
.
at
first
he
spoke
with
the
amused
and
mild
irony
now
customary
with
him
toward
every
body
and
especially
toward
himself
but
when
he
came
to
describe
the
horrors
and
sufferings
he
had
witnessed
he
was
unconsciously
car
ried
away
and
began
speaking
with
the
sup
pressed
emotion
of
a
man
reexperiencing
in
recollection
strong
impressions
he
has
lived
through
.
princess
mary
with
a
gentle
smile
looked
now
at
pierre
and
now
at
natasha
.
in
the
whole
narrative
she
saw
only
pierre
and
his
goodness
.
natasha
leaning
on
her
elbow
the
expression
of
her
face
constantly
changing
with
the
narrative
watched
pierre
with
an
attention
that
never
wanderedevidently
her
self
experiencing
all
that
he
described
.
not
only
her
look
but
her
exclamations
and
the
brief
questions
she
put
showed
pierre
that
she
understood
just
what
he
wished
to
convey
.
it
was
clear
that
she
understood
not
only
what
he
said
but
also
what
he
wished
to
but
could
not
express
in
words
.
the
account
pierre
gave
of
the
incident
with
the
child
and
the
woman
for
protecting
whom
he
was
arrested
was
this
it
was
an
awful
sight
children
aban
doned
some
in
the
flames

.

.

.
one
was
snatched
out
before
my
eyes

.

.

.
and
there
were
women
who
had
their
things
snatched
off
and
their
earrings
torn
out

.

.

.
he
flushed
and
grew
con
fused
.
then
a
patrol
arrived
and
all
the
men
all
those
who
were
not
looting
that
is
were
arrested
and
i
among
them
.
i
am
sure
youre
not
telling
us
everything
i
am
sure
you
did
something

.

.

.
said
natdsha
and
pausing
added
something
fine
pierre
continued
.
when
he
spoke
of
the
exe
book
fifteen
639
cution
he
wanted
to
pass
over
the
horrible
de
tails
but
natasha
insisted
that
he
should
not
omit
anything
.
pierre
began
to
tell
about
karatdev
but
paused
.
by
this
time
he
had
risen
from
the
ta
ble
and
was
pacing
the
room
natasha
follow
ing
him
with
her
eyes
.
then
he
added
no
you
cant
understand
what
i
learned
from
that
illiterate
manthat
simple
fellow
.
yes
yes
go
onl
said
natdsha
.
where
is
he
they
killed
him
almost
before
my
eyes
.
and
pierre
his
voice
trembling
continually
went
on
to
tell
of
the
last
days
of
their
retreat
of
karatdevs
illness
and
his
death
.
he
told
of
his
adventures
as
he
had
never
yet
recalled
them
.
he
now
as
it
were
saw
a
new
meaning
in
all
he
had
gone
through
.
now
that
he
was
telling
it
all
to
natdsha
he
experi
enced
that
pleasure
which
a
man
has
when
women
listen
to
himnot
clever
women
who
when
listening
either
try
to
remember
what
they
hear
to
enrich
their
minds
and
when
op
portunity
offers
to
retell
it
or
who
wish
to
adopt
it
to
some
thought
of
their
own
and
promptly
contribute
their
own
clever
com
ments
prepared
in
their
own
little
mental
work
shop
but
the
pleasure
given
by
real
women
gifted
with
a
capacity
to
select
and
absorb
the
very
best
a
man
shows
of
himself
.
natasha
with
out
knowing
it
was
all
attention
she
did
not
lose
a
word
no
single
quiver
in
pierres
voice
no
look
no
twitch
of
a
muscle
in
his
face
nor
a
single
gesture
.
she
caught
the
unfinished
word
in
its
flight
and
took
it
straight
into
her
open
heart
divining
the
secret
meaning
of
all
pierres
mental
travail
.
princess
mary
understood
his
story
and
sym
pathized
with
him
but
she
now
saw
something
else
that
absorbed
all
her
attention
.
she
saw
the
possibility
of
love
and
happiness
between
natasha
and
pierre
and
the
first
thought
of
this
filled
her
heart
with
gladness
.
it
was
three
oclock
in
the
morning
.
the
footmen
came
in
with
sad
and
stern
faces
to
change
the
candles
but
no
one
noticed
them
.
pierre
finished
his
story
.
natasha
continued
to
look
at
him
intently
with
bright
attentive
and
animated
eyes
as
if
trying
to
understand
something
more
which
he
had
perhaps
left
un
told
.
pierre
in
shamefaced
and
happy
confu
sion
glanced
occasionally
at
her
and
tried
to
think
what
to
say
next
to
introduce
a
fresh
subject
.
princess
mary
was
silent
.
it
occurred
to
none
of
them
that
it
was
three
oclock
and
time
to
go
to
bed
.
people
speak
of
misfortunes
and
suffer
ings
remarked
pierre
but
if
at
this
moment
i
were
asked
would
you
rather
be
what
you
were
before
you
were
taken
prisoner
or
go
through
all
this
again
then
for
heavens
sake
let
me
again
have
captivity
and
horsefleshl
we
imagine
that
when
we
are
thrown
out
of
our
usual
ruts
all
is
lost
but
it
is
only
then
that
what
is
new
and
good
begins
.
while
there
is
life
there
is
happiness
.
there
is
much
much
before
us
.
i
say
this
to
you
he
added
turning
to
natdsha
.
yes
yes
she
said
answering
something
quite
different
.
i
too
should
wish
nothing
but
to
relive
it
all
from
the
beginning
.
pierre
looked
intently
at
her
.
yes
and
nothing
more
said
natdsha
.
its
not
true
not
true
cried
pierre
.
i
am
not
to
blame
for
beingalive
and
wishing
to
live
nor
you
either
.
suddenly
natasha
bent
her
head
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
began
to
cry
.
what
is
it
natdsha
said
princess
mary
.
nothing
nothing
.
she
smiled
at
pierre
through
her
tears
.
good
night
it
is
time
for
bed
.
pierre
rose
and
took
his
leave
.
princess
mary
and
natdsha
met
as
usual
in
the
bedroom
.
they
talked
of
what
pierre
had
told
them
.
princess
mary
did
not
express
her
opinion
of
pierre
nor
did
natasha
speak
of
him
.
well
good
night
mary
1
said
natasha
.
do
you
know
i
am
often
afraid
that
by
not
speaking
of
him
she
meant
prince
andrew
for
fear
of
not
doing
justice
to
our
feelings
we
forget
him
.
princess
mary
sighed
deeply
and
thereby
ac
knowledged
the
justice
of
natashas
remark
but
she
did
not
express
agreement
in
words
.
is
it
possible
to
forget
said
she
.
it
did
me
so
much
good
to
tell
all
about
it
today
.
it
was
hard
and
painful
but
good
very
good
said
natdsha
.
i
am
sure
he
really
loved
him
.
that
is
why
i
told
him

.

.

.
was
it
all
right
she
added
suddenly
blushing
.
to
tell
pierre
oh
yes
.
what
a
splendid
man
he
is
said
princess
mary
.
do
you
know
mary

.

.

.
natdsha
suddenly
said
with
a
mischievous
smile
such
as
princess
mary
had
not
seen
on
her
face
for
a
long
time
he
has
somehow
grown
so
clean
smooth
and
freshas
if
he
had
just
come
out
of
a
russian
bath
do
you
understand
out
of
a
moral
bath
.
isnt
it
true
640
war
and
peace
yes
replied
princess
mary
.
he
has
great
ly
improved
.
with
a
short
coat
and
his
hair
cropped
just
as
if
well
just
as
if
he
had
come
straight
from
the
bath

.

.

.
papa
used
to

..
.
i
understand
why
he
prince
andrew
liked
no
one
so
much
as
him
said
princess
mary
.
yes
and
yet
he
is
quite
different
.
they
say
men
are
friends
when
they
are
quite
different
.
that
must
be
true
.
really
he
is
quite
unlike
him
in
everything
.
yes
but
hes
wonderful
.
well
good
night
said
natdsha
.
and
the
same
mischievous
smile
lingered
for
a
long
time
on
her
face
as
if
it
had
been
forgotten
there
.
chapter
xviii
it
was
a
long
time
before
pierre
could
fall
asleep
that
night
.
he
paced
up
and
down
his
room
now
turning
his
thoughts
on
a
difficult
problem
and
frowning
now
suddenly
shrug
ging
his
shoulders
and
wincing
and
now
smil
ing
happily
.
he
was
thinking
of
prince
andrew
of
nata
sha
and
of
their
love
at
one
moment
jealous
of
her
past
then
reproaching
himself
for
that
feeling
.
it
was
already
six
in
the
morning
and
he
still
paced
up
and
down
the
room
.
well
whats
to
be
done
if
it
cannot
be
avoided
whats
to
be
done
evidently
it
has
to
be
so
said
he
to
himself
and
hastily
un
dressing
he
got
into
bed
happy
and
agitated
but
free
from
hesitation
or
indecision
.
strange
and
impossible
as
such
happiness
seems
i
must
do
everything
that
she
and
1
may
be
man
and
wife
he
told
himself
.
a
few
days
previously
pierre
had
decided
to
go
to
petersburg
on
the
friday
.
when
he
awoke
on
the
thursday
savlich
came
to
ask
him
about
packing
for
the
journey
.
what
to
petersburg
what
is
petersburg
who
is
therein
petersburg
he
asked
involun
tarily
though
only
to
himself
.
oh
yes
long
ago
before
this
happened
i
did
for
some
reason
mean
to
go
to
petersburg
he
reflected
.
why
but
perhaps
i
shall
go
.
what
a
good
fellow
he
is
and
how
attentive
and
how
he
remembers
everything
he
thought
looking
at
savlichs
old
face
and
what
a
pleasant
smile
he
has
well
savich
do
you
still
not
wish
to
ac
cept
your
freedom
pierre
asked
him
.
whats
the
good
of
freedom
to
me
your
excellency
we
lived
under
the
late
count
the
kingdom
of
heaven
be
his
and
we
have
lived
under
you
too
without
ever
being
wronged
.
and
your
children
the
children
will
live
just
the
same
.
with
such
masters
one
can
live
.
but
what
about
my
heirs
said
pierre
.
supposing
i
suddenly
marry

..
.
it
might
hap
pen
he
added
with
an
involuntary
smile
.
if
i
may
take
the
liberty
your
excellency
it
would
be
a
good
thing
.
how
easy
he
thinks
it
thought
pierre
.
he
doesnt
know
how
terrible
it
is
and
how
dan
gerous
.
too
soon
or
too
late

..
.
it
is
terrible
so
what
are
your
orders
are
you
starting
tomorrow
asked
savelich
.
no
ill
put
it
off
for
a
bit
.
ill
tell
you
later
.
you
must
forgive
the
trouble
i
have
put
you
to
said
pierre
and
seeing
savelich
smile
he
thought
but
how
strange
it
is
that
he
should
not
know
that
now
there
is
no
petersburg
for
me
and
that
that
must
be
settled
first
of
all
but
probably
he
knows
it
well
enough
and
is
only
pretending
.
shall
i
have
a
talk
with
him
and
see
what
he
thinks
pierre
reflected
.
no
another
time
.
at
breakfast
pierre
told
the
princess
his
cousin
that
he
had
been
to
see
princess
mary
the
day
before
and
had
there
met
whom
do
you
think
natasha
rost6va
the
princess
seemed
to
see
nothing
more
extraordinary
in
that
than
if
he
had
seen
anna
semenovna
.
do
you
know
her
asked
pierre
.
i
have
seen
the
princess
she
replied
.
i
heard
that
they
were
arranging
a
match
for
her
with
young
rost6v
.
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
for
the
rost6vs
they
are
said
to
be
utterly
ruined
.
no
i
mean
doyouknownatdsha
rost6va
1
heard
about
that
affair
of
hers
at
the
time
.
it
was
a
great
pity
.
no
she
either
doesnt
understand
or
is
pre
tending
thought
pierre
.
better
not
say
any
thing
to
her
either
.
the
princess
too
had
prepared
provisions
for
pierres
journey
.
how
kind
they
all
are
thought
pierre
.
what
is
surprising
is
that
they
should
trouble
about
these
things
now
when
it
can
no
longer
be
of
interest
to
them
.
and
all
for
me
on
the
same
day
the
chief
of
police
came
to
pierre
inviting
him
to
send
a
representative
to
the
faceted
palace
to
recover
things
that
were
to
be
returned
to
their
owners
that
day
.
and
this
man
too
thought
pierre
looking
into
the
face
of
the
chief
of
police
.
what
a
fine
goodlooking
officer
and
how
kind
.
fancy
book
fifteen
bothering
about
such
trifles
now
and
they
actually
say
he
is
not
honest
and
takes
bribes
.
what
nonsense
besides
why
shouldnt
he
take
bribes
thats
the
way
he
was
brought
up
and
everybody
does
it
.
but
what
a
kind
pleasant
face
and
how
he
smiles
as
he
looks
at
me
.
pierre
went
to
princess
marys
to
dinner
.
as
he
drove
through
the
streets
past
the
houses
that
had
been
burned
down
he
was
surprised
by
the
beauty
of
those
ruins
.
the
picturesqueness
of
the
chimney
stacks
and
tum
bledown
walls
of
the
burnedout
quarters
of
the
town
stretching
out
and
concealing
one
another
reminded
him
of
the
rhine
and
the
colosseum
.
the
cabmen
he
met
and
their
pas
sengers
the
carpenters
cutting
the
timber
for
new
houses
with
their
axes
the
women
hawk
ers
and
the
shopkeepers
all
looked
at
him
with
cheerful
beaming
eyes
that
seemed
to
say
ah
there
he
is
lets
see
what
will
come
of
it
at
the
entrance
to
princess
marys
house
pierre
felt
doubtful
whether
he
had
really
been
there
the
night
before
and
had
really
seen
natdsha
and
talked
to
her
.
perhaps
i
imagined
it
perhaps
i
shall
go
in
and
find
no
one
there
.
but
he
had
hardly
entered
the
room
before
he
felt
her
presence
with
his
whole
being
by
the
loss
of
his
sense
of
freedom
.
she
was
in
the
same
black
dress
with
soft
folds
and
her
hair
was
done
the
same
way
as
the
day
before
yet
she
was
quite
different
.
had
she
been
like
this
when
he
entered
the
day
before
he
could
not
for
a
moment
have
failed
to
recognize
her
.
she
was
as
he
had
known
her
almost
as
a
child
and
later
on
as
prince
andrews
fiancee
.
a
bright
questioning
light
shone
in
her
eyes
and
on
her
face
was
a
friendly
and
strangely
roguish
expression
.
pierre
dined
with
them
and
would
have
spent
the
whole
evening
there
but
princess
mary
was
going
to
vespers
and
pierre
left
the
house
with
her
.
next
day
he
came
early
dined
and
stayed
the
whole
evening
.
though
princess
mary
and
natasha
were
evidently
glad
to
see
their
visitor
and
though
all
pierres
interest
was
now
cen
tered
in
that
house
by
the
evening
they
had
talked
over
everything
and
the
conversation
passed
from
one
trivial
topic
to
another
and
repeatedly
broke
off
.
he
stayed
so
long
that
princess
mary
and
natdsha
exchanged
glances
evidently
wondering
when
he
would
go
.
pierre
noticed
this
but
could
not
go
.
he
felt
uneasy
and
embarrassed
but
sat
on
because
he
simply
could
not
get
up
and
take
his
leave
.
princess
mary
foreseeing
no
end
to
this
641
rose
first
and
complaining
of
a
headache
be
gan
to
say
good
night
.
so
you
are
going
to
petersburg
tomorrow
she
asked
.
no
i
am
not
going
pierre
replied
hastily
in
a
surprised
tone
and
as
though
offended
.
yes

..
.
no

..
.
to
petersburg
tomorrow
but
i
wont
say
goodby
yet
.
i
will
call
round
in
case
you
have
any
commissions
for
me
said
he
standing
before
princess
mary
and
turning
red
but
not
taking
his
departure
.
natasha
gave
him
her
hand
and
went
out
.
princess
mary
on
the
other
hand
instead
of
go
ing
away
sank
into
an
armchair
and
looked
sternly
and
intently
at
him
with
her
deep
ra
diant
eyes
.
the
weariness
she
had
plainly
shown
before
had
now
quite
passed
off
.
with
a
deep
and
longdrawn
sigh
she
seemed
to
be
pre
pared
for
a
lengthy
talk
.
when
natdsha
left
the
room
pierres
confu
sion
and
awkwardness
immediately
vanished
and
were
replaced
by
eager
excitement
.
he
quickly
moved
an
armchair
toward
princess
mary
.
yes
i
wanted
to
tell
you
said
he
answer
ing
her
look
as
if
she
had
spoken
.
princess
help
me
what
am
i
to
do
can
i
hope
prin
cess
my
dear
friend
listenl
i
know
it
all
.
i
know
i
am
not
worthy
of
her
i
know
its
im
possible
to
speak
of
it
now
.
but
i
want
to
be
a
brother
to
her
.
no
not
that
i
dont
i
cant

.

.

.
he
paused
and
rubbed
his
face
and
eyes
with
his
hands
.
well
he
went
on
with
an
evident
effort
at
selfcontrol
and
coherence
.
i
dont
know
when
i
began
to
love
her
but
i
have
loved
her
and
her
alone
all
my
life
and
i
love
her
so
that
i
cannot
imagine
life
without
her
.
i
cannot
propose
to
her
at
present
but
the
thought
that
perhaps
she
might
someday
be
my
wife
and
that
i
may
be
missing
that
possibility

.

.

.
that
possibility

..
.
is
terrible
.
tell
me
can
i
hope
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
dear
princess
he
added
after
a
pause
and
touched
her
hand
as
she
did
not
reply
.
i
am
thinking
of
what
you
have
told
me
answered
princess
mary
.
this
is
what
i
will
say
.
you
are
right
that
to
speak
to
her
of
love
at
present

.

.

.
princess
mary
stopped
.
she
was
going
to
say
that
to
speak
of
love
was
impossible
but
she
stopped
because
she
had
seen
by
the
sudden
change
in
natdsha
two
days
before
that
she
would
not
only
not
be
hurt
if
pierre
spoke
of
his
love
but
that
it
was
the
very
thing
she
wished
for
.
648
war
and
peace
to
speak
to
her
now
wouldnt
do
said
the
princess
all
the
same
.
but
what
am
i
to
do
leave
it
to
me
said
princess
mary
.
i
know

.

.

.
pierre
was
looking
into
princess
marys
eyes
.
well

.

.

.
well

.

.

.
he
said
.
i
know
that
she
loves

.

.

.
will
love
you
princess
mary
corrected
herself
.
before
her
words
were
out
pierre
had
sprung
up
and
with
a
frightened
expression
seized
princess
marys
hand
.
what
makes
you
think
so
you
think
i
may
hope
you
think

.

.

.

yes
i
think
so
said
princess
mary
with
a
smile
.
write
to
her
parents
and
leave
it
to
me
.
1
will
tell
her
when
i
can
.
i
wish
it
to
hap
pen
and
my
heart
tells
me
it
will
.
no
it
cannot
be
i
how
happy
i
am
but
it
cant
be
.

.

pierre
kept
saying
as
he
kissed
princess
marys
hands
.
go
to
petersburg
that

be
best
.
and
i
will
write
to
you

there
very
well
ill

.
but
i
may
come
again
tomorrow
next
day
pierre
came
to
say
goodby
.
natisha
was
less
animated
than
she
had
been
the
day
before
but
that
day
as
he
looked
at
her
pierre
sometimes
felt
as
if
he
was
vanishing
and
that
neither
he
nor
she
existed
any
longer
that
nothing
existed
but
happiness
.
is
it
possible
no
it
cant
be
he
told
himself
at
every
look
gesture
and
word
that
filled
his
soul
with
joy
.
when
on
saying
goodby
he
took
her
thin
slender
hand
he
could
not
help
holding
it
a
little
longer
in
his
own
.
is
it
possible
that
this
hand
that
face
those
eyes
all
this
treasure
of
feminine
charm
so
strange
to
me
now
is
it
possible
that
it
will
one
day
be
mine
forever
as
familiar
to
me
as
i
am
to
myself

.

.

.
no
thats
impossible

.

.

.
goodby
count
she
said
aloud
.
i
shall
look
forward
very
much
to
your
return
she
added
in
a
whisper
.
and
these
simple
words
her
look
and
the
expression
on
her
face
which
accompanied
them
formed
for
two
months
the
subject
of
in
exhaustible
memories
interpretations
and
happy
meditations
for
pierre
.

i
shall
look
forward
very
much
to
your
return

yes
yes
how
did
she
say
it
yes
i
shall
look
forward
very
much
to
your
return
.
oh
how
happy
i
am
what
is
happening
to
me
how
happy
i
ami
said
pierre
to
himself
.
chapter
xix
there
was
nothing
in
pierres
soul
now
at
all
like
what
had
troubled
it
during
his
courtship
of
hfcne
.
he
did
not
repeat
to
himself
with
a
sicken
ing
feeling
of
shame
the
words
he
had
spoken
or
say
oh
why
did
i
not
say
that
and
whatever
made
me
say
je
vous
aime
on
the
contrary
he
now
repeated
in
imagination
every
word
that
he
or
natdsha
had
spoken
and
pictured
every
detail
of
her
face
and
smile
and
did
not
wish
to
diminish
or
add
anything
but
only
to
repeat
it
again
and
again
.
there
was
now
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
in
his
mind
as
to
whether
what
he
had
undertaken
was
right
or
wrong
.
only
one
terrible
doubt
sometimes
crossed
his
mind
wasnt
it
all
a
dream
isnt
princess
mary
mistaken
am
i
not
too
con
ceited
and
selfconfident
i
believe
all
this
and
suddenly
princess
mary
will
tell
her
and
she
will
be
sure
to
smile
and
say
how
strange
he
must
be
deluding
himself
.
doesnt
he
know
that
he
is
a
man
just
a
man
while
i

.

.

.

i
am
something
altogether
different
and
higher
.

that
was
the
only
doubt
often
troubling
pierre
.
he
did
not
now
make
any
plans
.
the
happiness
before
him
appeared
so
inconceiv
able
that
if
only
he
could
attain
it
it
would
be
the
end
of
all
things
.
everything
ended
with
that
.
a
joyful
unexpected
frenzy
of
which
he
had
thought
himself
incapable
possessed
him
.
the
whole
meaning
of
lifenot
for
him
alone
but
for
the
whole
world
seemed
to
him
centered
in
his
love
and
the
possibility
of
being
loved
by
her
.
at
times
everybody
seemed
to
him
to
be
occupied
with
one
thing
only
his
future
happiness
.
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
that
other
people
were
all
as
pleased
as
he
was
him
self
and
merely
tried
to
hide
that
pleasure
by
pretending
to
be
busy
with
other
interests
.
in
every
word
and
gesture
he
saw
allusions
to
his
happiness
.
he
often
surprised
those
he
met
by
his
significantly
happy
looks
and
smiles
which
seemed
to
express
a
secret
understanding
be
tween
him
and
them
.
and
when
he
realized
that
people
might
not
be
aware
of
his
happi
ness
he
pitied
them
with
his
whole
heart
and
felt
a
desire
somehow
to
explain
to
them
that
all
that
occupied
them
was
a
mere
frivolous
trifle
unworthy
of
attention
.
when
it
was
suggested
to
him
that
he
should
enter
the
civil
service
or
when
the
war
or
any
general
political
affairs
were
discussed
on
the
assumption
that
everybodys
welfare
depended
on
this
or
that
issue
of
events
he
would
listen
book
fifteen
64s
with
a
mild
and
pitying
smile
and
surprise
people
by
his
strange
comments
.
but
at
this
time
he
saw
everybody
both
those
who
as
he
imagined
understood
the
real
meaning
of
life
that
is
what
he
was
feeling
and
those
unfortunates
who
evidently
did
not
under
stand
it
in
the
bright
light
of
the
emotion
that
shone
within
himself
and
at
once
without
any
effort
saw
in
everyone
he
met
everything
that
was
good
and
worthy
of
being
loved
.
when
dealing
with
the
affairs
and
papers
of
his
dead
wife
her
memory
aroused
in
him
no
feeling
but
pity
that
she
had
not
known
the
bliss
he
now
knew
.
prince
vasili
who
having
obtained
a
new
post
and
some
fresh
decora
tions
was
particularly
proud
at
this
time
seemed
to
him
a
pathetic
kindly
old
man
much
to
be
pitied
.
often
in
afterlife
pierre
recalled
this
period
of
blissful
insanity
.
all
the
views
he
formed
of
men
and
circumstances
at
this
time
re
mained
true
for
him
always
.
he
not
only
did
not
renounce
them
subsequently
but
when
he
was
in
doubt
or
inwardly
at
variance
he
re
ferred
to
the
views
he
had
held
at
this
time
of
his
madness
and
they
always
proved
correct
.
i
may
have
appeared
strange
and
queer
then
he
thought
but
i
was
not
so
mad
as
i
seemed

pierres
insanity
consisted
in
not
waiting
as
he
used
to
do
to
discover
personal
attributes
which
he
termed
good
qualities
in
people
before
loving
them
his
heart
was
now
over
flowing
with
love
and
by
loving
people
with
out
cause
he
discovered
indubitable
causes
for
loving
them
.
chapter
xx
after
pierres
departure
that
first
evening
when
natdsha
had
said
to
princess
mary
with
a
gaily
mocking
smile
he
looks
just
yes
just
as
if
he
had
come
out
of
a
russian
bath
in
a
short
coat
and
with
his
hair
cropped
some
thing
hidden
and
unknown
to
herself
but
irrepressible
awoke
in
natdshas
soul
.
everything
her
face
walk
look
and
voice
was
suddenly
altered
.
to
her
own
surprise
a
power
of
life
and
hope
of
happiness
rose
to
the
surface
and
demanded
satisfaction
.
from
that
evening
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
that
had
happened
to
her
.
she
no
longer
com
plained
of
her
position
did
not
say
a
word
about
the
past
and
no
longer
feared
to
make
happy
plans
for
the
future
.
she
spoke
little
of
pierre
but
when
princess
mary
mentioned
him
a
longextinguished
light
once
more
kin
dled
in
her
eyes
and
her
lips
curved
with
a
strange
smile
.
the
change
that
took
place
in
natasha
at
first
surprised
princess
mary
but
when
she
understood
its
meaning
it
grieved
her
.
can
she
have
loved
my
brother
so
little
as
to
be
able
to
forget
him
so
soon
she
thought
when
she
reflected
on
the
change
.
but
when
she
was
with
natdsha
she
was
not
vexed
with
her
and
did
not
reproach
her
.
the
reawakened
power
of
life
that
had
seized
natasha
was
so
evidently
irrepressible
and
unexpected
by
her
that
in
her
presence
princess
mary
felt
that
she
had
no
right
to
reproach
her
even
in
her
heart
.
natasha
gave
herself
up
so
fully
and
frankly
to
this
new
feeling
that
she
did
not
try
to
hide
the
fact
that
she
was
no
longer
sad
but
bright
and
cheerful
.
when
princess
mary
returned
to
her
room
after
her
nocturnal
talk
with
pierre
natdsha
met
her
on
the
threshold
.
he
has
spoken
yes
he
has
spoken
she
repeated
.
and
a
joyful
yet
pathetic
expression
which
seemed
to
beg
forgiveness
for
her
joy
settled
on
natdshas
face
.

understandable
and
touching
as
the
look
with
which
natasha
gazed
at
her
seemed
to
princess
mary
and
sorry
as
she
was
to
see
her
agitation
these
words
pained
her
for
a
mo
ment
.
she
remembered
her
brother
and
his
love
.
but
whats
to
be
done
she
cant
help
it
thought
the
princess
.
and
with
a
sad
and
rather
stern
look
she
told
natdsha
all
that
pierre
had
said
.
on
hear
ing
that
he
was
going
to
petersburg
natdsha
was
astounded
.
to
petersburgl
she
repeated
as
if
unable
to
understand
.
but
noticing
the
grieved
expression
on
prin
cess
marys
face
she
guessed
the
reason
of
that
sadness
and
suddenly
began
to
cry
.
mary
said
she

then
why

chapter
i
seven
years
had
passed
.
the
storm
tossed
sea
of
european
history
had
subsided
within
its
shores
and
seemed
to
have
become
calm
.
but
the
mysterious
forces
that
move
humanity
mys
terious
because
the
laws
of
their
motion
are
un
known
to
us
continued
to
operate
.
though
the
surface
of
the
sea
of
history
seemed
motionless
the
movement
of
humanity
went
on
as
unceasingly
as
the
flow
of
time
.
var
ious
groups
of
people
formed
and
dissolved
the
coming
formation
and
dissolution
of
king
doms
and
displacement
of
peoples
was
in
course
of
preparation
.
the
sea
of
history
was
not
driven
spasmodi
cally
from
shore
to
shore
as
previously
.
it
was
seething
in
its
depths
.
historic
figures
were
not
borne
by
the
waves
from
one
shore
to
another
as
before
.
they
now
seemed
to
rotate
on
one
spot
.
the
historical
figures
at
the
head
of
ar
mies
who
formerly
reflected
the
movement
of
the
masses
by
ordering
wars
campaigns
and
battles
now
reflected
the
restless
movement
by
political
and
diplomatic
combinations
laws
and
treaties
.
the
historians
call
this
activity
of
the
histor
ical
figures
the
reaction
.
in
dealing
with
this
period
they
sternly
con
demn
the
historical
personages
who
in
their
opinion
caused
what
they
describe
as
the
re
action
.
all
the
wellknown
people
of
that
pe
riod
from
alexander
and
napoleon
to

de

and
the
rest
pass
before
their
stern
judgment
seat
and
are
acquitted
or
con
demned
according
to
whether
they
conduced
to
progress
or
to
reaction
.
according
to
their
accounts
a
reaction
took
place
at
that
time
in
russia
also
and
the
chief
culprit
was
alexander
i
the
same
man
who
ac
cording
to
them
was
the
chief
cause
of
the
lib
eral
movement
at
the
commencement
of
his
reign
being
the
savior
of
russia
.
there
is
no
one
in
russian
literature
now
from
schoolboy
essayist
to
learned
historian
who
does
not
throw
his
little
stone
at
alexan
der
for
things
he
did
wrong
at
this
period
of
his
reign
.
he
ought
to
have
acted
in
this
way
and
in
that
way
.
in
this
case
he
did
well
and
in
that
case
badly
.
he
behaved
admirably
at
the
be
ginning
of
his
reign
and
during
1812
but
act
ed
badly
by
giving
a
constitution
to
poland
forming
the
holy
alliance
entrusting
power
to
arakcheev
favoring
gohtsyn
and
mysticism
and
afterwards
shishk6v
and
photius
.
he
also
acted
badly
by
concerning
himself
with
the
ac
tive
army
and
disbanding
the
semenov
regi
ment
.
it
would
take
a
dozen
pages
to
enumerate
all
the
reproaches
the
historians
address
to
him
based
on
their
knowledge
of
what
is
good
for
humanity
.
what
do
these
reproaches
mean
do
not
the
very
actions
for
which
the
histo
rians
praise
alexander
i
the
liberal
attempts
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
his
struggle
with
napoleon
the
firmness
he
displayed
in
1812
and
the
campaign
of
1813
flow
from
the
same
sourcesthe
circumstances
of
his
birth
educa
tion
and
lifethat
made
his
personality
what
it
was
and
from
which
the
actions
for
which
they
blame
him
the
holy
alliance
the
resto
ration
of
poland
and
the
reaction
of
1820
and
later
also
flowed
in
what
does
the
substance
of
those
reproach
es
lie
it
lies
in
the
fact
that
an
historic
character
like
alexander
i
standing
on
the
highest
pos
sible
pinnacle
of
human
power
with
the
blind
ing
light
of
history
focused
upon
him
a
char
acter
exposed
to
those
strongest
of
all
influ
ences
the
intrigues
flattery
and
selfdeception
inseparable
from
power
a
character
who
at
every
moment
of
his
life
felt
a
responsibility
for
all
that
was
happening
in
europe
and
not
a
fictitious
but
a
live
character
who
like
every
man
had
his
personal
habits
passions
and
im
pulses
toward
goodness
beauty
and
truth
that
this
character
though
not
lacking

war
and
peace
tue
the
historians
do
not
accuse
him
of
that
had
not
the
same
conception
of
the
welfare
of
humanity
fifty
years
ago

as
a
presentday
professor
who
from
his
youth
upwards
has
been
occupied
with
learning
that
is
with
books
and
lectures
and
with
taking
notes
from
them
.
but
even
if
we
assume
that
fifty
years
ago
alexander
i
was
mistaken
in
his
view
of
what
was
good
for
the
people
we
must
inevitably
assume
that
the
historian
who
judges
alexan
der
will
also
after
the
lapse
of
some
time
turn
out
to
be
mistaken
in
his
view
of
what
is
good
for
humanity
.
this
assumption
is
all
the
more
natural
and
inevitable
because
watching
the
movement
of
history
we
sec
that
every
year
and
with
each
new
writer
opinion
as
to
what
is
good
for
mankind
changes
so
that
what
once
seemed
good
ten
years
later
seems
bad
and
vice
versa
.
and
what
is
more
we
find
at
one
and
the
same
time
quite
contradictory
views
as
to
what
is
bad
and
what
is
good
in
his
tory
some
people
regard
giving
a
constitu
tion
to
poland
and
forming
the
holy
alliance
as
praiseworthy
in
alexander
while
others
re
gard
it
as
blameworthy
.
the
activity
of
alexander
or
of
napoleon
cannot
be
called
useful
or
harmful
for
it
is
impossible
to
say
for
what
it
was
useful
or
harmful
.
if
that
activity
displeases
somebody
this
is
only
because
it
does
not
agree
with
his
limited
understanding
of
what
is
good
.

it

if
the

had
been
the

that
aim

have
been
accomplished
without

without

the

was
the

without

without

if
the

was
the

the

could
have
accomplished
that
much
better
than

if
the
aim
was
the
progress

it
is
easy
to
sec
that
there
are
other
ways
of
diffusing

more
expedient
than
by

instead
of
getting
into

every

goes
into

where
there
are

this
very
ram

but
the

need
only
cease
to
suppose
that
all
that

to
them
happens
solely
for
the
attainment
of
their
sheepish
aims
they
need
only
admit
that
what
happens
to
them
may
also
have
purposes
beyond

and
they
will
at
once
perceive
a
unity
and
coher

in
what
happened
to

even
if
they
do
not

they
are

they
will
at

know
that
all
that
happened
to

did
not
happen
accidentally
and
will
no
longer
need
the
conceptions
of

only
by
renouncing
our
claim
to
discern
a
purpose
immediately
intelligible
to
us
and
ad
mitting
the
ultimate
purpose
to
be
beyond
our
ken
may
we
discern
the
sequence
of
ex
periences
in
the
lives
of
historic
characters
and
perceive
the
cause
of
the
effect
they
produce
incommensurable
with
ordinary
human
capa
bilities
and
then
the
words
chance
and

become
superfluous

we
need
only
confess
that
we
do
not
know
the
purpose
of
the
european

and
that
we
know
only
the
facts
that
is
the
mur
ders
first
in
france
then
in
italy
in

in
prussia
in

in

and
in

and
that
the
movements
from
the
west
to
the
east
and
from
the
east
to
the
west
form
the
es
sence
and
purpose
of
these
events
and
not
only
shall
we
have
no
need
to
see
exceptional
ability
and
genius
in
napoleon
and
alexander
but
we
shall
be
unable
to
consider
them
to
be
anything
but
like
other
men
and
we
shall
not
be
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
chance
for
an
explanation
of
those
small
events
which
made
these
people
what
they
were
but
it
will
be
clear
that
all
those
small
events
were
inevita
ble
.
by
discarding
a
claim
to
knowledge
of
the
ultimate
purpose
we
shall
clearly
perceive
that
just
as
one
cannot
imagine
a
blossom
or
seed
for
any
single
plant
better
suited
to
it
than
those
it
produces
so
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
any
two
people
more
completely
adapted
down
to
the
smallest
detail
for
the
purpose
they
had
to
fulfill
than
napoleon

their

chapter
iii
the
fundamental
and
essential
significance
of
the
european
events
of
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
lies
in
the
movement
of
the
mass
of
the
european
peoples
from
west
to
east
and
afterwards
from
east
to
west
.
the
commencement
of
that
movement
was
the
movement
from
west
to
east
.
for
the
peoples
of
the
west
to
be
able
to
make
their
warlike
move
ment
to
moscow
it
was
necessary
i
that
they
should
form
themselves
into
a
military
group
of
a
size
able
to
endure
a
collision
with
the
warlike
military
group
of
the
east
2
that
they
should
abandon
all
established
traditions
and
customs
and
3
that
during
their
military
movement
they
should
have
at
their
head
a
man
who
could
justify
to
himself
and
to
them
the
deceptions
robberies
and
murders
which
would
have
to
be
committed
during
that
move
ment
.
and
beginning
with
the
french
revolution
the
old
inadequately
large
group
was
destroyed
as
well
as
the
old
habits
and
traditions
and
step
by
step
a
group
was
formed
of
larger
di
mensions
with
new
customs
and
traditions
and
a
man
was
produced
who
would
stand
at
the
head
of
the
coming
movement
and
bear
the
responsibility
for
all
that
had
to
be
done
.
a
man
without
convictions
without
habits
without
traditions
without
a
name
and
not
even
a
frenchman
emerges
by
what
seem
the
strangest
chances
from
among
all
the
seething
french
parties
and
without
joining
any
one
of
them
is
borne
forward
to
a
promi
nent
position

the
ignorance
of
his
colleagues
the
weak
ness
and
insignificance
of
his
opponents

frankness
of
his
falsehoods
and
the
dazzling
and
selfconfident
limitations
of
this
man

him

owing

just
those
which
might
have
destroyed
his
prestige
do
not

no

on

he
finds

in
a
process
of

which
all
those
who
are
in
it
are
inevitably
wiped
out

destroyed

and
by

an

from
this
dangerous
position
presents
itself
in
the
form
of

in

in

ascribing
to
it
an

the

the
republican

which
a

earlier
might
have

him

reached
its
extreme
limit
and
his
presence
there
now
as
a
newcomer
free
from
party
entanglements
can
only
serve
to
exalt
him
and
though
he
him
self
has
no

he
is
quite
ready
for

he
had
no

he
was
afraid
of

but
the
parties
snatched
at
him
and
demanded

he
alone
with
his
ideal

insane
selfadulation

boldness
in

alone
could
justify
what
had
to
be
done
.
he
is
needed
for
the
place
that
awaits
him
and
so
almost
apart
from
his
will
and
despite
his
indecision
his
lack
of
a
plan
and
all
his
mistakes
he
is
drawn
into
a
conspiracy
that
aims
at
seizing
power
and
the
conspiracy
is
crowned
with
success
.
he
is
pushed
into
a

that

not

it
rises
again
from

as

the

.
what
was
needed
for
him
who
overshadow
ing
others
stood
at
the
head
of
that
movement
from
east
to
west
what
was
needed
was
a
sense
of
justice
and
a
sympathy
with
european
affairs
but
a
re
mote
sympathy
not
dulled
by
petty
interests
a
moral
superiority
over
those
sovereigns
of
the
day
who
cooperated
with
him
a
mild
and
attractive
personality
and
a
personal
griev
ance
against
napoleon
.
and
all
this
was
found
in
alexander
i
all
this
had
been
prepared
by
innumerable
socalled
chances
in
his
life
his
education
his
early
liberalism
the
advisers
who
surrounded
him
and
by
austerlitz
and
tilsit
and
erfurt
.
during
the
national
war
he
was
inactive
be
cause
he
was
not
needed
.
but
as
soon
as
the
necessity
for
a
general
european
war
presented
itself
he
appeared
in
his
place
at
the
given
mo
ment
and
uniting
the
nations
of
europe
led
them
to
the
goal
.
the
goal
is
reached
.
after
the
final
war
of
1815
alexander
possesses
all
possible
power
.
how
does
he
use
it
alexander
i
the
pacifier
of

the
man
who
from
his
early
years
had
striven
only
for
his
peoples
welfare
the
originator
of
the
liberal
innovations
in
his
fatherland
now
that
he
seemed
to
possess
the
utmost
power
and
therefore
to
have
the
possibility
of
bringing
about
the
welfare
of

alexander
i

and
feeling
the

of

upon
him
suddenly
recognizes
the
insignificance
of
that
supposed
power
turns
away
from
it
and
gives
it
into

.
i
too
am
a
man
like
the
rest
of
you
.
let
me
live
like
a
man
and
think
of
my
soul
and
of
god
.
as
the
sun
and
each
atom
of
ether
is
a
sphere
complete
in
itself
and
yet
at
the
same
time
only
a
pan
of
a
whole
too
immense
for
man
to
comprehend
so
each
individual
has
within
himself
his
own
aims
and
yet
has
them
to
serve
a
general
purpose
incomprehensible
to
man
.
a
bee
settling
on
a
flower
has
stung
a
child
.
and
the
child
is
afraid
of
bees
and
declares
that
bees
exist
to
sting
people
.
a
poet
admires
the
bee
sucking
from
the
chalice
of
a
flower
and
says
it
exists
to
suck
the
fragrance
of
flow
ers
.
a
beekeeper
seeing
the
bee
collect
pollen
from
flowers
and
carry
it
to
the
hive
says
that
it
exists
to
gather
honey
.
another
beekeeper
who
has
studied
the
life
of
the
hive
more
close
ly
says
that
the
bee
gathers
pollen
dust
to
feed
the
young
bees
and
rear
a
queen
and
that
it
exists
to
perpetuate
its
race
.
a
botanist
notices
that
the
bee
flying
with
the
pollenof
a
male
flower
to
a
pistil
fertilizes
the
latter
and
sees
in
this
the
purpose
of
the
bees
existence
.
an
other
observing
the
migration
of
plants
no
tices
that
the
bee
helps
in
this
work
and
may
say
that
in
this
lies
the
purpose
of
the
bee
.
but
the
ultimate
purpose
of
the
bee
is
not
exhaust
ed
by
the
first
the
second
or
any
of
the
proc
esses
the
human
mind
can
discern
.
the
higher
the
human
intellect
rises
in
the
discovery
of
these
purposes
the
more
obvious
it
becomes
that
the
ultimate
purpose
is
beyond
our
com
prehension
.
all
that
is
accessible
to
man
is
the
relation
of
the
life
of
the
bee
to
other
manifestations
of
life
.
and
so
it
is
with
the
purpose
of
historic
characters
and
nations
.

he
seemed
to
be
unable
to
understand
the
meaning
of
all
these

and
bowed
his
old
head
in
a
spir
itual
sense
as
if
expecting
and
inviting
further
blows
which
would
finish
him
.
he
seemed
now
frightened
and
distraught
and
now
unnatural
ly
animated
and
enterprising
.
the
arrangements
for
natashas
marriage
occupied
him
for
a
while
.
he
ordered
dinners
and
suppers
and
obviously
tried
to
appear
cheerful
but
his
cheerfulness
was
not
infec
tious
as
it
used
to
be
on
the
contrary
it
evoked
the
compassion
of
those
who
knew
and
liked
him
.
when
pierre
and
his
wife
had
left
he
grew
very
quiet
and
began
to
complain
of
depres
sion
.
a
few
days
later
he
fell
ill
and
took
to
his
bed
.
he
realized
from
the
first
that
he
would

not
get

despite

the
countess
passed
a
fortnight
in
an
armchair
by
his
pillow
without
undressing
.
every
time
she
gave
him
his
medicine
he
sobbed
and
silently
kissed
her
hand
.
on
his
last
day
sobbing
he
asked
her
and
his
absent
son
to
forgive
him
for
having
dissipated
their

the

fault
of
which

he

came
to

at

which
of

has

of
his
own
it
was
just
when
the
counts
affairs
had
be
come
so
involved
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
would
happen
if
he
lived
another
year
that
he
unexpectedly
died
.
nicholas
was
with
the
russian
army
in
paris
when
the
news
of
his
fathers
death
reached
him
.
he
at
once
resigned
his
commission
and
without
waiting
for
it
to
be
accepted
took
leave
of
absence
and
went
to
moscow
.
the
state
of
the
counts
affairs
became
quite
obvious
a
month
after
his
death
surprising
everyone
by
the
immense
total
of
small
debts
the
existence
of
which
no
one
had
suspected
.
the
debts
amounted
to
double
the
value
of
the
property
.
friends
and
relations
advised
nicholas
to
decline
the
inheritance
.
but
he
regarded
such
a
refusal
as
a
slur
on
his
fathers
memory
which
he
held
sacred
and
therefore
would
not
hear
of
refusing
and
accepted
the
inheritance
together
with
the
obligation
to
pay
the
debts
.
the
creditors
who
had
so
long
been
silent
restrained
by
a
vague
but
powerful
influence
exerted
on
them
while
he
lived
by
the
counts
careless
good
nature
all
proceeded
to
enforce
their
claims
at
once
.
as
always
happens
in
such
cases
rivalry
sprang
up
as
to
which
should
get
paid
first
and
those
who
like
mitenka
held
promissory
notes
given
them
as
presents
now
became
the
most
exacting
of
the
creditors
.
nicholas
was
allowed
no
respite
and
no
peace
and
those
who
had
seemed
to
pity
the
old
man
the
cause
of
their
losses
if
they
were
losses
now
remorselessly
pursued
the
young
heir
who
had
voluntarily
undertaken
the
debts
and
was
obviously
not
guilty
of
contracting
them
.
not
one
of
the
plans
nicholas
tried
suc
ceeded
the
estate
was
sold
by
auction
for
half
its
value
and
half
the
debts
still
remained
un

nicholas
accepted
thirty
thousand

offered
him
by
his
brotherinlaw
beziik

to
pay
off
debts
he
regarded
as
genuinely
due
for

and
to
avoid
being
im
prisoned
for
the
remainder
as
the
creditors
threatened
he
reentered
the
government

he
could
not

where
he
would
have
been

at
the

his
mother

clung
to
him
as
her
one
hold
on
life
and
so
despite
his
reluctance
to
remain
in
moscow
among
people
who
had
known
him
before
and
despite
his
abhorrence
of
the
civil
service
he
accepted
a
post
in
mos
cow
in
that
service
doffed
the
uniform
of
which
he
was
so
fond
and
moved
with
his
mother
and
s6nya
to
a
small
house
on

.

natdsha
and
pierre
were
living
in
peters
burg
at
the
time
and
had
no
clear
idea
of
nicholas
circumstances
.
having
borrowed
money
from
his
brotherinlaw
nicholas
tried
to
hide
his
wretched
condition
from
him
.
his
position
was
the
more
difficult
because
with
his
salary
of
twelve
hundred
rubles
he
had
not
only
to
keep
himself
his
mother
and
s6nya
but
had
to
shield
his
mother
from
knowledge
of
their
poverty
.
the
countess
could
not
con
ceive
of
life
without
the
luxurious
conditions
she
had
been
used
to
from
childhood
and
un
able
to
realize
how
hard
it
was
for
her
son
kept
demanding
now
a
carriage
which
they
did
not
keep
to
send
for
a
friend
now
some
expensive
article
of
food
for
herself
or
wine
for
her
son
or
money
to
buy
a
present
as
a
sur
prise
for
natisha
or
s6nya
or
for
nicholas
himself
.
s6nya
kept
house
attended
on
her
aunt
read
to
her
put
up
with
her
whims
and
secret
illwill
and
helped
nicholas
to
conceal
their
poverty
from
the
old
countess
.
nicholas
felt
himself
irredeemably
indebted
to
sonya
for
all
she
was
doing
for
his
mother
and
greatly
admired
her
patience
and
devotion
but
tried
to
keep
aloof
from
her
.
he
seemed
in
his
heart
to
reproach
her
for
being
too
perfect
and
because
there
was
noth
ing
to
reproach
her
with
.
she
had
all
that
peo
ple
are
valued
for
but
little
that
could
have
made
him
love
her
.
he
felt
that
the
more
he
valued
her
the
less
he
loved
her
.
he
had
taken
her
at
her
word
when
she

and
now
behaved
as
if
all
that
had
passed
between
them
had
been
long
forgotten
and
could
never
in
any
case
be
renewed
.
nicholas
position
became
worse
and
worse
.
the
idea
of
putting
something
aside
out
of
his
salary
proved
a
dream
.
not
only
did
he
not
save
anything
but
to
comply
with
his
mothers
demands
he
even
incurred
some
small
debts
.
he
could
see
no
way
out
of
this
situation
.
the
idea
of
marrying
some
rich
woman
which
was
suggested
to
him
by
his
female
relations
was
repugnant
to
him
.
the
other
way
out
his
mothers
death
never
entered
his
head
.
he
wished
for
nothing
and
hoped
for
nothing
and
deep
in
his
heart
experienced
a
gloomy
and
stern
satisfaction
in
an
uncomplaining
en
durance
of
his
position
.
he
tried
to
avoid
his
old
acquaintances
with
their
commiseration
and
offensive
offers
of
assistance
he
avoided
all
distraction
and
recreation
and
even
at
home
did
nothing
but
play
cards
with
his
mother
pace
silently
up
and
down
the
room
and
smoke
one
pipe
after
another
.
he
seemed
carefully
to
cherish
within
himself
the
gloomy
mood
which
alone
enabled
him
to
endure
his
position
.
i

learned

situated
and
how
the

has
sacrificed
himself
for
his

as
people
were
saying

i
never
expected
anything

of

said
princess

to
herself
feeling
a
joyous
sense
of
her
love
for
him

remembering
her
friendly
relations
with
all
the
rost6vs
which
had
made
her
almost
a
member
of
the
family
she
thought
it
her
duty
to
go
to

them

in
vor6nezh
she
was
shy
about
doing
so
.
making
a
great
effort
she
did
however
go
to
call
on
them
a
few
weeks
after
her
arrival
in
moscow
.
nicholas
was
the
first
to
meet
her
as
the
countess
room
could
only
be
reached
through
his
.
but
instead
of
being
greeted
with
pleasure
as
she
had
expected
at
his
first
glance
at
her
his
face
assumed
a
cold
stiff
proud
expression
she
had
not
seen
on
it
before
.
he
inquired
about
her
health
led
the
way
to
his
mother
and
having
sat
there
for
five
minutes
left
the
room
.
when
the
princess
came
out
of
the
countess
room
nicholas
met
her
again
and
with
marked
solemnity
and
stiffness
accompanied
her
to
the
anteroom
.
to
her
remarks
about
his
mothers
health
he
made
no
reply
.
whats
that
to
you
leave
me
in
peace
his
looks
seemed
to
say
.
why
does
she
come
prowling
here
what
does
she
want
i
cant
bear
these
ladies
and
all
these
civilities
said
he
aloud
in
s6nyas
pres
ence
evidently
unable
to
repress
his
vexation
after
the
princess
carriage
had
disappeared
.
oh
nicholas
how
can
you
talk
like
that
cried
s6nya
hardly
able
to
conceal
her
delight
.
she
is
so
kind
and
mamma
is
so
fond
of
herl
nicholas
did
not
reply
and
tried
to
avoid
speaking
of
the
princess
any
more
.
but
after
her
visit
the
old
countess
spoke
of
her
several
times
a
day
.
she
sang
her
praises
insisted
that
her
son
must
call
on
her
expressed
a
wish
to
see
her
often
but
yet
always
became
illhumored
when
she
began
to
talk
about
her
.
nicholas
tried
to
keep
silence
when
his
mother
spoke
of
the
princess
but
his
silence
ir
ritated
her
.
she
is
a
very
admirable
and
excellent
young
woman
said
she
and
you
must
go
and
call
on
her
.
you
would
at
least
be
seeing
somebody
and
i
think
it
must
be
dull
for
you
only
seeing
us
.
but
i
dont
in
the
least
want
to
mamma
.
you
used
to
want
to
and
now
you
dont
.
really
i
dont
understand
you
my
dear
.
one
day
you
are
dull
and
the
next
you
refuse
to
see
anyone
.
but
i
never
said
i
was
dull
.
why
you
said
yourself
you
dont
want
even
to
see
her
.
she
is
a
very
admirable
young
woman
and
you
always
liked
her
but
now
suddenly
you
have
got
some
notion
or
other
in
your
head
.
you
hide
everything
from
me
.
not
at
all
mamma
.
if
i
were
asking
you
to
do
something
disa
greeable
now
but
i
only
ask
you
to
return
a
call
.
one
would
think
mere
politeness
re
quired
it
.

..
.
well
i
have
asked
you
and
now
i
wont
interfere
any
more
since
you
have
se
crets
from
your
mother
.
well
then
ill
go
if
you
wish
it
.
it
doesnt
matter
to
me
.
i
only
wish
it
for
your
sake
.
nicholas
sighed
bit
his
mustache
and
laid
out
the
cards
for
a
patience
trying
to
divert
his
mothers
attention
to
another
topic
.
the
same
conversation
was
repeated
next
day
and
the
day
after
and
the
day
after
that
.
after
her
visit
to
the
rost6vs
and
her
unex
pectedly
chilly
reception
by
nicholas
prin
cess
mary
confessed
to
herself
that
she
had
been
right
in
not
wishing
to
be
the
first
to
call
.
first
epilogue
i
expected
nothing
else
she
told
herself
calling
her
pride
to
her
aid
.
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
and
i
only
wanted
to
see
the
old
lady
who
was
always
kind
to
me
and
to
whom
i
am
under
many
obligations
.
but
she
could
not
pacify
herself
with
these
reflections
a
feeling
akin
to
remorse
troubled
her
when
she
thought
of
her
visit
.
though
she
had
firmly
resolved
not
to
call
on
the
rost6vs
again
and
to
forget
the
whole
matter
she
felt
herself
all
the
time
in
an
awkward
position
.
and
when
she
asked
herself
what
distressed
her
she
had
to
admit
that
it
was
her
relation
to
rostov
.
his
cold
polite
manner
did
not
express
his
feeling
for
her
she
knew
that
but
it
con
cealed
something
and
until
she
could
discover
what
that
something
was
she
felt
that
she
could
not
be
at
ease
.
one
day
in
midwinter
when
sitting
in
the
schoolroom
attending
to
her
nephews
lessons
she
was
informed
that
rost6v
had
called
.
with
a
firm
resolution
not
to
betray
herself
and
not
show
her
agitation
she
sent
for
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
went
with
her
to
the
drawing
room
.
her
first
glance
at
nicholas
face
told
her
that
he
had
only
come
to
fulfill
the
demands
of
politeness
and
she
firmly
resolved
to
main
tain
the
tone
in
which
he
addressed
her
.
they
spoke
of
the
countess
health
of
their
mutual
friends
of
the
latest
war
news
and
when
the
ten
minutes
required
by
propriety
had
elapsed
after
which
a
visitor
may
rise
nicholas
got
up
to
say
goodby
.
with
mademoiselle
bouriennes
help
the
princess
had
maintained
the
conversation
very
well
but
at
the
very
last
moment
just
when
he
rose
she
was
so
tired
of
talking
of
what
did
not
interest
her
and
her
mind
was
so
full
of
the
question
why
she
alone
was
granted
so
lit
tle
happiness
in
life
that
in
a
fit
of
absent
mindedness
she
sat
still
her
luminous
eyes
gazing
fixedly
before
her
not
noticing
that
he
had
risen
.
nicholas
glanced
at
her
and
wishing
to
ap
pear
not
to
notice
her
abstraction
made
some
remark
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
then
again
looked
at
the
princess
.
she
still
sat
mo
tionless
with
a
look
of
suffering
on
her
gentle
face
.
he
suddenly
felt
sorry
for
her
and
was
vaguely
conscious
that
he
might
be
the
cause
of
the
sadness
her
face
expressed
.
he
wished
to
help
her
and
say
something
pleasant
but
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
.
goodby
princess
said
he
.
she
started
flushed
and
sighed
deeply
.
653
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
as
if
wak
ing
up
.
are
you
going
already
count
well
then
goodby
oh
but
the
cushion
for
the
countess
wait
a
moment
ill
fetch
it
said
made
moiselle
bourienne
and
she
left
the
room
.
they
both
sat
silent
with
an
occasional
glance
at
one
another
.
yes
princess
said
nicholas
at
last
with
a
sad
smile
it
doesnt
seem
long
ago
since
we
first
met
at
boguchdrovo
but
how
much
water
has
flowed
since
then
in
what
distress
we
all
seemed
to
be
then
yet
i
would
give
much
to
bring
back
that
time

.

.

.
but
theres
no
bring
ing
it
back
.
princess
mary
gazed
intently
into
his
eyes
with
her
own
luminous
ones
as
he
said
this
.
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
fathom
the
hidden
meaning
of
his
words
which
would
explain
his
feeling
for
her
.
yes
yes
said
she
but
you
have
no
reason
to
regret
the
past
count
.
as
i
understand
your
present
life
i
think
you
will
always
recall
it
with
satisfaction
because
the
selfsacrifice
that
fills
it
now

.

.

.
i
cannot
accept
your
praise
he
interrupted
her
hurriedly
.
on
the
contrary
i
continually
reproach
myself
.

.

.

.
but
this
is
not
at
all
an
interesting
or
cheerful
subject
.
his
face
again
resumed
its
former
stiff
and
cold
expression
.
but
the
princess
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
man
she
had
known
and
loved
and
it
was
to
him
that
she
now
spoke
.
i
thought
you
would
allow
me
to
tell
you
this
she
said
.
i
had
come
so
near
to
you

.

.

.
and
to
all
your
family
that
i
thought
you
would
not
consider
my
sympathy
misplaced
but
i
was
mistaken
and
suddenly
her
voice
trem
bled
.
i
dont
know
why
she
continued
re
covering
herself
but
you
used
to
be
different
and

.

.

.
there
are
a
thousand
reasons
why
9
laying
special
emphasis
on
the
why
.
thank
you
princess
he
added
softly
.
sometimes
it
is
hard
.
so
thats
why
thats
why
a
voice
whis
pered
in
princess
marys
soul
.
no
it
was
not
only
that
gay
kind
and
frank
look
not
only
that
handsome
exterior
that
i
loved
in
him
.
i
divined
his
noble
resolute
selfsacrificing
spirit
too
she
said
to
herself
.
yes
he
is
poor
now
and
i
am
rich
.

.

.

.
yes
thats
the
only
reason
.

.

.

remem
bering
his
former
tenderness

looking
now
at
his

face
she
suddenly
un
derstood
the
cause
of

coldness

and

but
why

why
she
almost
cried
unconsciously
moving
closer

why

you
must
tell
me
he
was
silent

i
dont
understand
your

she
continued
but
its
hard
for
me

..
.
i
confess
it
.
for
some
reason
you
wish
to
deprive
me
of
our
former
friendship
.
and
that
hurts
me
.
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
voice

i
have
had
so
little
happiness
in

that
every
loss
is
hard
for
me

began
to

was
hurrying
from

for

they

chapter
vii
in
the
winter
of
1813
nicholas
married
prin
cess
mary
and
moved
to
bald
hills
with
his
wife
his
mother
and
s6nya
.
within
four
years
he
had
paid
off
all
his
re
maining
debts
without
selling
any
of
his
wifes
property
and
having
received
a
small
inherit
ance
on
the
death
of
a
cousin
he
paid
his
debt
to
pierre
as
well
.
in
another
three
years
by
1820
he
had
so
managed
his
affairs
that
he
was
able
to
buy
a
small
estate
adjoining
bald
hills
and
was
ne
gotiating
to
buy
back
otrddnoe
that
being
his
pet
dream
.
having
started
farming
from
necessity
he
soon
grew
so
devoted
to
it
that
it
became
his
favorite
and
almost
his
sole
occupation
.
nich
olas
was
a
plain
farmer
he
did
not
like
inno
vations
especially
the
english
ones
then
com
ing
into
vogue
.
he
laughed
at
theoretical
treatises
on
estate
management
disliked
fac
tories
the
raising
of
expensive
products
and
the
buying
of
expensive
seed
corn
and
did
not
make
a
hobby
of
any
particular
part
of
the
work
on
his
estate
.
he
always
had
before
his
minds
eye
the
estate
as
a
whole
and
not
any
particular
part
of
it
.
the
chief
thing
in
his
eyes
was
not
the
nitrogen
in
the
soil
nor
the
oxy
gen
in
the
air
nor
manures
nor
special
plows
but
that
most
important
agent
by
which
nitro
gen
oxygen
manure
and
plow
were
made
ef
fectivethe
peasant
laborer
.
when
nicholas
first
began
farming
and
began
to
understand
its
different
branches
it
was
the
serf
who
es
pecially
attracted
his
attention
.
the
peasant
seemed
to
him
not
merely
a
tool
but
also
a
judge
of
farming
and
an
end
in
himself
.
at
first
he
watched
the
serfs
trying
to
understand
their
aims
and
what
they
considered
good
and
bad
and
only
pretended
to
direct
them
and
give
orders
while
in
reality
learning
from
them
their
methods
their
manner
of
speech
and
their
judgment
of
what
was
good
and
bad
.
only
when
he
had
understood
the
peasants
tastes
and
aspirations
had
learned
to
talk
their
language
to
grasp
the
hidden
meaning
of
their
words
and
felt
akin
to
them
did
he
be
gin
boldly
to
manage
his
serfs
that
is
to
per
form
toward
them
the
duties
demanded
of
him
.
and
nicholas
management
produced
very
brilliant
results
.
guided
by
some
gift
of
insight
on
taking
up
the
management
of
the
estates
he
at
once
un
erringly
appointed
as
bailiff
village
elder
and
delegate
the
very
men
the
serfs
would
them
selves
have
chosen
had
they
had
the
right
to
choose
and
these
posts
never
changed
hands
.
before
analyzing
the
properties
of
manure
be
fore
entering
into
the
debit
and
credit
as
he
ironically
called
it
he
found
out
how
many
cattle
the
peasants
had
and
increased
the
num
ber
by
all
possible
means
.
he
kept
the
peasant
families
together
in
the
largest
groups
possible
not
allowing
the
family
groups
to
divide
into
separate
households
.
he
was
hard
alike
on
the
lazy
the
depraved
and
the
weak
and
tried
to
get
them
expelled
from
the
commune
.
he
was
as
careful
of
the
sowing
and
reaping
of
the
peasants
hay
and
corn
as
of
his
own
and
few
landowners
had
their
crops
sown
and
harvested
so
early
and
so
well
or
got
so
good
a
return
as
did
nicholas
.
he
disliked
having
anything
to
do
with
the
domestic
serfs
the
drones
as
he
called
them
and
everyone
said
he
spoiled
them
by
his
laxity
.
when
a
decision
had
to
be
taken
re
garding
a
domestic
serf
especially
if
one
had
to
be
punished
he
always
felt
undecided
and
consulted
everybody
in
the
house
but
when
it
was
possible
to
have
a
domestic
serf
conscripted
instead
of
a
land
worker
he
did
so
without
the
least
hesitation
.
he
never
felt
any
hesitation
in
dealing
with
the
peasants
.
he
knew
that
his
every
decision
would
be
approved
by
them
all
with
very
few
exceptions
.
he
did
not
allow
himself
either
to
be
hard
on
or
punish
a
man
or
to
make
things
easy
for
or
reward
anyone
merely
because
he
felt
in
clined
to
do
so
.
he
could
not
have
said
by
what
standard
he
judged
what
he
should
or
should
not
do
but
the
standard
was
quite
firm
and
definite
in
his
own
mind
.
often
speaking
with
vexation
of
some
fail
ure
or
irregularity
he
would
say
what
can
one
do
with
our
russian
peasants
and
imag
ined
that
he
could
not
bear
them
.
yet
he
loved
our
russian
peasants
and
their
way
of
life
with
his
whole
soul
and
for
that
very
reason
had
understood
and
assimi
lated
the
one
way
and
manner
of
farming
which
produced
good
results
.
countess
mary
was
jealous
of
this
passion
of
her
husbands
and
regretted
that
she
could
not
share
it
but
she
could
not
understand
the
joys
and
vexations
he
derived
from
that
world
to
her
so
remote
and
alien
.
she
could
not
under
stand
why
he
was
so
particularly
animated
and
happy
when
after
getting
up
at
daybreak
and
spending
the
whole
morning
in
the
fields
or
on
the
threshing
floor
he
returned
from
the
sowing
or
mowing
or
reaping
to
have
tea
with
her
.
she
did
not
understand
why
he
spoke
with
such
admiration
and
delight
of
the
farming
of
the
thrifty
and
welltodo
peasant
matthew
ermishin
who
with
his
family
had
carted
corn
all
night
or
of
the
fact
that
his
nicholas
sheaves
were
already
stacked
before
anyone
else
had
his
harvest
in
.
she
did
not
understand
why
he
stepped
out
from
the
window
to
the
veranda
and
smiled
under
his
mustache
and
winked
so
joyfully
when
warm
steady
rain
be
gan
to
fall
on
the
dry
and
thirsty
shoots
of
the
young
oats
or
why
when
the
wind
carried
away
a
threatening
cloud
during
the
hay
harvest
he
would
return
from
the
barn

did
she
understand
why
he
kind
hearted
and
always
ready
to
anticipate
her
wishes
should
become
almost
desperate
when
she
brought
him
a
petition
from
some
peasant
men
or
women
who
had
appealed
to
her
to
be
excused
some
work
why
he
that
kind

should
obstinately
refuse
her
angrily
ask
ing
her
not
to

she
felt
he
had
a
world
apart
which
he
loved
passionately
and
which
had
laws
she
had
not
fathomed
.
sometimes
when
trying

understand
him
she
spoke
of
the
good
work
he
was
doing
for
his
serfs
he
would
be

reply
not

all

just

chapter

one
matter
connected
with
his
management
sometimes
worried
nicholas
and
that
was
his
quick
temper
together
with
his
old
hussar
hab
it
of
making
free
use
of
his
fists
.
at
first
he
saw
nothing
reprehensible
in
this
but
in
the
sec
ond
year
of
his
marriage
his
view
of
that
form
of
punishment
suddenly
changed
.
once
in
summer
he
had
sent
for
the
village
elder
from
boguchdrovo
a
man
who
had
suc
ceeded
to
the
post
when
dron
died
and
who
was
accused
of
dishonesty
and
various
irregu
larities
.
nicholas
went
out
into
the
porch
to
question
him
and
immediately
after
the
elder
had
given
a
few
replies
the
sound
of
cries
and
blows
were
heard
.
on
returning
to
lunch
nich
olas
went
up
to
his
wife
who
sat
with
her
head
bent
low
over
her
embroidery
frame
and
as
usual
began
to
tell
her
what
he
had
been
do
ing
that
morning
.
among
other
things
he
spoke
of
the
boguchclrovo
elder
.
countess
mary
turned
red
and
then
pale
but
continued
to
sit
with
head
bowed
and
lips
compressed
and
gave
her
husband
no
reply
.
such
an
insolent
scoundrel
he
cried
grow
ing
hot
again
at
the
mere
recollection
of
him
.
if
he
had
told
me
he
was
drunk
and
did
not
see

..
.
but
what
is
the
matter
with
you
mary
he
suddenly
asked
.
countess
mary
raised
her
head
and
tried
to
speak
but
hastily
looked
down
again
and
her
lips
puckered
.
why
whatever
is
the
matter
my
dearest
the
looks
of
the
plain
countess
mary
always

improved
when
she
was
in
tears
.
she
never
cried
from
pain
or
vexation
but
always
from
sorrow
or
pity
and
when
she
wept
her
radiant
eyes
acquired
an
irresistible
charm
.
the
moment
nicholas
took
her
hand
she
could
no
longer
restrain
herself
and
began
to
cry
.
nicholas
i
saw
it

..
.
he
was
to
blame
but
why
do
you

.

.

.
nicholas
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
.
nicholas
said
nothing
.
he
flushed
crimson
left
her
side
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
.
he
understood
what
she
was
weeping
about
but
could
not
in
his
heart
at
once
agree
with
her
that
what
he
had
regarded
from
childhood
as
quite
an
everyday
event
was
wrong
.
is
it
just
sentimentality
old
wives
tales
or
is
she
right
he
asked
himself
.
before
he
had
solved
that
point
he
glanced
again
at
her
face
filled
with
love
and
pain
and
he
suddenly
realized
that
she
was
right
and
that
he
had
long
been
sinning
against
himself
.
mary
he
said
softly
going
up
to
her
it
will
never
happen
again
i
give
you
my
word
.
never
he
repeated
in
a
trembling
voice
like
a
boy
asking
for
forgiveness
.
the
tears
flowed
faster
still
from
the
count
ess
eyes
.
she
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
.
nicholas
when
did
you
break
your
cameo
she
asked
to
change
the
subject
looking
at
his
finger
on
which
he
wore
a
ring
with
a
cameo
of
laocoons
head
.
today
it
was
the
same
affair
.
oh
mary
dont
remind
me
of
ill
and
again
he
flushed
.
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
it
shant
occur
again
and
let
this
always
be
a
reminder
to
me
and
he
pointed
to
the
broken
ring
.
after
that
when
in
discussions
with
his
vil
lage
elders
or
stewards
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
and
his
fists
began
to
clench
nicholas
would
turn
the
broken
ring
on
his
finger
and
would
drop
his
eyes
before
the
man
who
was
making
him
angry
.
but
he
did
forget
himself
once
or
twice
within
a
twelvemonth
and
then
he
would
go
and
confess
to
his
wife
and
would
again
promise
that
this
should
really
be
the
very
last
time
.
mary
you
must
despise
mel
he
would
say
.
i
deserve
it
.
you
should
go
go
away
at
once
if
you
dont
feel
itrong
enough
to
control
yourself
she
would
reply
sadly
trying
to
comfort
her
hus
band
.
among
the
gentry
of
the
province
nicholas
was
respected
but
not
liked
.
he
did
not
con
cern
himself
with
the
interests
of
his
own
class
war
and
peace
and
consequently
some
thought
him
proud
and
others
thought
him
stupid
.
the
whole
sum
mer
from
spring
sowing
to
harvest
he
was
busy
with
the
work
on
his
farm
.
in
autumn
he
gave
himself
up
to
hunting
with
the
same
busi
nesslike
seriousness
leaving
home
for
a
month
or
even
two
with
his
hunt
.
in
winter
he
visited
his
other
villages
or
spent
his
time
reading
.
the
books
he
read
were
chiefly
historical
and
on
these
he
spent
a
certain
sum
every
year
.
he
was
collecting
as
he
said
a
serious
library
and
he
made
it
a
rule
to
read
through
all
the
books
he
bought
.
he
would
sit
in
his
study
with
a
grave
air
reading
a
task
he
first
imposed
up
on
himself
as
a
duty
but
which
afterwards
be
came
a
habit
affording
him
a
special
kind
of
pleasure
and
a
consciousness
of
being
occu
pied
with
serious
matters
.
in
winter
except
for
business
excursions
he
spent
most
of
his
time
at
home
making
himself
one
with
his
family
and
entering
into
all
the
details
of
his
childrens
relations
with
their
mother
.
the
harmony
between
him
and
his
wife
grew
closer
and
closer
and
he
daily
discovered
fresh
spir
itual
treasures
in
her
.
from
the
time
of
his
marriage
s6nya
had
lived
in
his
house
.
before
that
nicholas
had
told
his
wife
all
that
had
passed
between
him
self
ands6nya
blaming
himself
and
commend
ing
her
.
he
had
asked
princess
mary
to
be
gentle
and
kind
to
his
cousin
.
she
thoroughly
realized
the
wrong
he
had
dones6nya
felt
her
self
to
blame
toward
her
and
imagined
that
her
wealth
had
influenced
nicholas
choice
.
she
could
not
find
fault
with
s6nya
in
any
way
and
tried
to
be
fond
of
her
but
often
felt
ill
will
toward
her
which
she
could
not
overcome
.
once
she
had
a
talk
with
her
friend
natasha
about
s6nya
and
about
her
own
injustice
to
ward
her
.
you
know
said
natasha
you
have
read
the
gospels
a
great
deal
there
is
a
passage
in
them
that
just
fits
s6nya
.
what
asked
countess
mary
surprised
.

to
him
that
hath
shall
be
given
and
from
him
that
hath
not
shall
be
taken
away
.
you
remember
she
is
one
that
hath
not
why
i
dont
know
.
perhaps
she
lacks
egotism
i
dont
know
but
from
her
is
taken
away
and
every
thing
has
been
taken
away
.
sometimes
i
am
dreadfully
sorry
for
her
.
formerly
i
very
much
wanted
nicholas
to
marry
her
but
i
always
had
a
sort
of
presentiment
that
it
would
not
come
off
.
she
is
a
sterile
flower
you
know
like
some
strawberry
blossoms
.
sometimes
i
am
sorry
for
her
and
sometimes
i
think
she
first
epilogue
doesnt
feel
it
as
you
or
i
would
.
though
countess
mary
told
natdsha
that
those
words
in
the
gospel
must
be
understood
differently
yet
looking
at
s6nya
she
agreed
with
natashas
explanation
.
it
really
seemed
that
s6nya
did
not
feel
her
position
trying
and
had
grown
quite
reconciled
toherlotasatere
flower
.
she
seemed
to
be
fond
not
so
much
of
individuals
as
of
the
family
as
a
whole
.
like
a
cat
she
had
attached
herself
not
to
the
people
but
to
the
home
.
she
waited
on
the
old
count

petted
and
spoiled
the
children
was
al
ways
ready
to
render
the
small
services
for
which
she
had
a
gift
and
all
this
was
uncon
sciously
accepted
from
her
with
insufficient
gratitude
.
the
country
seat
at
bald
hills
had
been
re
built
though
not
on
the
same
scale
as
under
the
old

the
buildings
begun
under
straitened
cir
cumstances
were
more
than
simple

the

on

had

with

hard
sofas
armchairs
tables
and
chairs
made
by

out
of
their

was
spacious
and
had

and
apartments
for

relations
sometimes
came

had
gone

of
his
own
for
three
weeks
as
he
said
but
had
remained
there
nearly
seven
weeks
and
was
expected

every

.
besides
the

nicholas
old

t

was
staying
with

fifth
of

on
the
sixth
which
was
his

day
when
the
house
would
be
full
of
visitors
nicholas
knew
he
would
have
to
exchange
his

for
a
tail
coat
and
put
on
narrow
boots
with
pointed
toes
and
drive
to
the

he
had
built
and
then
receive
visitors
who
would
come
to
congratulate
him
offer
them
re
freshments
and
talk
about
the
elections
of
the
nobility
but
he
considered
himself
entitled
to
spend
the
eve
of
that
day
in
his
usual
way
.
he
examined
the
bailiffs
accounts
of
the
village
in
ryazan
which
belonged
to
his
wifes
neph
ew
wrote
two
business
letters
and
walked
over
to
the
granaries
cattle
yards
and
stables
be
fore
dinner
.
having
taken
precautions
against
the
general
drunkenness
to
be
expected
on
the
morrow
because
it
was
a
great
saints
day
he
returned
to
dinner
and
without
having
time
for
a
private
talk
with
his
wife
sat
down
at
the
long
table
laid
for
twenty
persons
at
which
the
whole
household
had
assembled
.
at
that
table
were
his

his

was
living

in
retirement
at

.
countess
mary
sat
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
.
when
her
husband
took
his
place
she
concluded
from
the
rapid
manner
in
which
after
taking
up
his
table
napkin
he
pushed
back
the
tumbler
and
wineglass
standing
be
fore
him
that
he
was
out
of
humor
as
was
sometimes
the
case
when
he
came
in
to
din
ner
straight
from
the
farm
especially
before
the
soup
.
countess
mary
well
knew
that
mood
of
his
and
when
she
herself
was
in
agood
frame
of
mind
quietly
waited
till
he
had
had
his
soup
and
then
began
to
talk
to
him
and
make
him
admit
that
there
was
no
cause
for
his
illhumor
.
but
today
she
quite
forgot
that
and
was
hurt
that
he
should
be
angry
with
her
without
any
reason
and
she
felt
unhappy
.
she
asked
him
where
he
had
been
.
he
replied
.
she
again
in
quired
whether
everything
was
going
well
on
the
farm
.
her
unnatural
tone
made
him
wince
unpleasantly
and
he
replied
hastily
.
then
im
not
mistaken
thought
countess
mary
.
why
is
he
cross
with
me
she
conclud
ed
from
his
tone
that
he
was
vexed
with
her
and
wished
to
end
the
conversation
.
she
knew
her
remarks
sounded
unnatural
but
could
not
refrain
from
asking
some
more
questions
.
thanks
to
denfsov
the
conversation
at
table
soon
became
general
and
lively
and
she
did
not
talk
to
her
husband
.
when
they
left
the
table
and
went
as
usual
to
thank
the
old
count
ess

held
out

kissed
her

and
asked
him
why
he
was
angry
with

.
you
always
have
such
strange
fancies
i
didnt
even
think
of
being

he
replied
.
but
the
word
always
seemed
to
her
to
im

i
wont
tell
you
why

nicholas
and
his
wife
lived
together
so
hap
pily
that
even
s6nya
and
the
old
countess
who
felt
jealous
and
would
have
liked
them
to
dis
agree
could
find
nothing
to
reproach
them
with
but
even
they
had
their
moments
of
an
tagonism
.
occasionally
and
it
was
always
just
after
they
had
been
happiest
together
they
suddenly
had
a
feeling
of
estrangement
and
hostility
which
occurred
most
frequently
dur
ing
countess
marys
pregnancies
and
this
was
such
a
time
.
well
messieurs
et
mesdames
said
nicho

loudly
and
with
apparent
cheerfulness
it
seemed
to
countess
mary
that
he
did
it

and
without
a
word
to
his
wife
he
went
to
the
little
sitting
room
and
lay
down
on
the
sofa
.
thats
always
the
way
thought
countess
mary
.
he
talks
to
everyone
except
me
.
i
see

..
.
i
see
that
i
am
repulsive
to
him
especially
when
i
am
in
this
condition
.
she
looked
down
at
her
expanded
figure
and
in
the
glass
at
her
pale
sallow
emaciated
face
in
which
her
eyes
now
looked
larger
than
ever
.
and
everything
annoyed
her
denfsovs
shouting
and
laughter
natashas
talk
and
es
pecially
a
quick
glance
s6nya
gave
her
.
s6nya
was
always
the
first
excuse
countess
mary
found
for
feeling
irritated
.
having
sat
awhile
with
her
visitors
without
understanding
anything
of
what
they
were
saying
she
softly
left
the
room
and
went
to
the
nursery
.
the
children
were
playing
at
going
to
mos
cow
in
a
carriage
made
of
chairs
and
invited
her
to
go
with
them
.
she
sat
down
and
played
with
them
a
little
but
the
thought
of
her
hus
band
and
his
unreasonable
crossness
worried
her
.
she
got
up
and
walking
on
tiptoe
with
difficulty
went
to
the
small
sitting
room
.
perhaps
he
is
not
asleep
ill
have
an
ex
planation
with
him
she
said
to
herself
.
little
andrew
her
eldest
boy
imitating
his
mother
followed
her
on
tiptoe
.
she
did
not
notice
him
.
mary
dear
i
think
he
is
asleephe
was
so
tired
said
s6nya
meeting
her
in
the
large
sitting
room
it
seemed
to
countess
mary
that
she
crossed
her
path
everywhere
.
andrew
may
wake
him
.
countess
mary
looked
round
saw
little
an
drew
following
her
felt
that
s6nya
was
right
and
for
that
very
reason
flushed
and
with
evi
dent
difficulty
refrained
from
saying
something
harsh
.
she
made
no
reply
but
to
avoid
obeying
s6nya
beckoned
to
andrew
to
follow
her
quiet
ly
and
went
to
the
door
.
s6nya
went
away
by
another
door
.
from
the
room
in
which
nicho
las
was
sleeping
came
the
sound
of
his
even
breathing
every
slightest
tone
of
which
was
fa
miliar
to
his
wife
.
as
she
listened
to
it
she
saw
before
her
his
smooth
handsome
forehead
his
mustache
and
his
whole
face
as
she
had
so
often
seen
it
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
when
he
slept
.
nicholas
suddenly
moved
and
cleared
his
throat
.
and
at
that
moment
little
andrew
shouted
from
outside
the
door
papa
mam
mas
standing
herel
countess
mary
turned
pale
with
fright
and
made
signs
to
the
boy
.
he
grew
silent
and
quiet
ensued
fora
moment
terrible
to
countess
mary
.
she
knew
how
nicholas
disliked
being
waked
.
then
through
the
door
she
heard
nicholas
clearing
his
throat
again
and
stirring
and
his
voice
said
crossly
i
cant
get
a
moments
peace
.

.

.

.
mary
is
that
you
why
did
you
bring
him
here
i
only
came
in
to
look
and
did
not
notice

.

.

.
forgive
me
.

.

.

.
nicholas
coughed
and
said
no
more
.
count
ess
mary
moved
away
from
the
door
and
took
the
boy
back
to
the
nursery
.
five
minutes
later
little
blackeyed
threeyearold
natasha
her
fathers
pet
having
learned
from
her
brother
that
papa
was
asleep
and
mamma
was
in
the
sitting
room
ran
to
her
father
unobserved
by
her
mother
.
the
darkeyed
little
girl
boldly
opened
the
creaking
door
went
up
to
the
sofa
with
energetic
steps
of
her
sturdy
little
legs
and
having
examined
the
position
of
her
fa
ther
who
was
asleep
with
his
back
to
her
rose
on
tiptoe
and
kissed
the
hand
which
lay
under
his
head
.
nicholas
turned
with
a
tender
smile
on
his
face
.
natdsha
natasha
came
countess
marys
frightened
whisper
from
the
door
.
papa
wants
to
sleep
.
no
mamma
he
doesnt
want
to
sleep
said
little
natdsha
with
conviction
.
hes
laugh
ing
.
nicholas
lowered
his
legs
rose
and
took
his
daughter
in
his
arms
.
come
in
mary
he
said
to
his
wife
.
she
went
in
and
sat
down
by
her
husband
.
i
did
not
notice
him
following
me
she
first
epilogue
said
timidly
.
i
just
looked
in
.
holding
his
little
girl
with
one
arm
nicholas
glanced
at
his
wife
and
seeing
her
guilty
ex
pression
put
his
other
arm
around
her
and
kissed
her
hair
.
may
i
kiss
mamma
he
asked
natasha
.
natasha
smiled
bashfully
.
again
i
she
commanded
pointing
with
a
peremptory
gesture
to
the
spot
where
nicho
las
had
placed
the
kiss
.
i
dont
know
why
you
think
i
am
cross
said
nicholas
reply
ing
to
the
question
he
knew
was
in
his
wifes
mind
.
you
have
no
idea
how
unhappy
how
lone
ly
i
feel
when
you
are
like
that
.
it
always
seems
to
me

.

.

.
mary
dont
talk
nonsense
.
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
1
he
said
gaily
.
it
seems
to
be
that
you
cant
love
me
that
i
am
so
plain

.

.

.
always

.

.

.
and
now

..
.
in
this
cond

.

.

.
oh
how
absurd
you
arel
it
is
not
beauty
that
endears
its
love
that
makes
us
see
beauty
.
it
is
only
malvinas
and
women
of
that
kind
who
are
loved
for
their
beauty
.
but
do
i
love
my
wife
i
dont
love
her
but

..
.
i
dont
know
how
to
put
it
.
without
you
or
when
some
thing
comes
between
us
like
this
i
seem
lost
and
cant
do
anything
.
now
do
i
love
my
fin
ger
i
dont
love
it
but
just
try
to
cut
it
offl
im
not
like
that
myself
but
i
understand
.
so
youre
not
angry
with
me
awfully
angry
he
said
smiling
and
get
ting
up
.
and
smoothing
his
hair
he
began
to
pace
the
room
.
do
you
know
mary
what
ive
been
think
ing
he
began
immediately
thinking
aloud
in
his
wifes
presence
now
that
they
had
made
it
up
.
he
did
not
ask
if
she
was
ready
to
listen
to
him
.
he
did
not
care
.
a
thought
had
occurred
to
him
and
so
it
belonged
to
her
also
.
and
he
told
her
of
his
intention
to
persuade
pierre
to
stay
with
them
till
spring
.
countess
mary
listened
till
he
had
finished
made
some
remark
and
in
her
turn
began
thinking
aloud
.
her
thoughts
were
about
the
children
.
you
can
see
the
woman
in
her
already
she
sajfl
in
french
pointing
to
little
natasha
.
you
reproach
us
women
with
being
illogical
.
here
is
our
logic
.
i
say
papa
wants
to
sleep
but
she
says
no
hes
laughing
.
and
she
was
right
said
countess
mary
with
a
happy
smile
.
yes
yes
.
and
nicholas
taking
his
little
daughter
in
his
strong
hand
lifted
her
high
6
59
placed
her
on
his
shoulder
held
her
by
the
legs
and
paced
the
room
with
her
.
there
was
an
expression
of
carefree
happiness
on
the
faces
of
both
father
and
daughter
.
but
you
know
you
may
be
unfair
.
you
are
too
fond
of
this
one
his
wife
whispered
in
french
.
yes
but
what
am
i
to
do

..
.
i
try
not
to
show

.

.

.
at
that
moment
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
door
pulley
and
footsteps
in
the
hall
and
ante
room
as
if
someone
had
arrived
.
somebody
has
come
.
i
am
sure
it
is
pierre
.
i
will
go
and
see
said
countess
mary
and
left
the
room
.
in
her
absence
nicholas
allowed
himself
to
give
his
little
daughter
a
gallop
round
the
room
.
out
of
breath
he
took
the
laughing
child
quickly
from
his
shoulder
and
pressed
her
to
his
heart
.
his
capers
reminded
him
of
dancing
and
looking
at
the
childs
round
hap
py
little
face
he
thought
of
what
she
would
be
like
when
he
was
an
old
man
taking
her
into
society
and
dancing
the
mazurka
with
her
as
his
old
father
had
danced
daniel
cooper
with
his
daughter
.
it
is
he
it
is
he
nicholas
said
countess
mary
reentering
the
room
a
few
minutes
lat
er
.
now
our
natdsha
has
come
to
life
.
you
should
have
seen
her
ecstasy
and
how
he
caught
it
for
having
stayed
away
so
long
.
well
come
along
now
quick
quick
its
time
you
two
were
parted
she
added
looking
smilingly
at
the
little
girl
who
clung
to
her
father
.
nicholas
went
out
holding
the
child
by
the
hand
.
countess
mary
remained
in
the
sittingroom
.
i
should
never
never
have
believed
that
one
could
be
so
happy
she
whispered
to
her
self
.
a
smile
lit
up
her
face
but
at
the
same
time
she
sighed
and
her
deep
eyes
expressed
a
quiet
sadness
as
though
she
felt
through
her
happiness
that
there
is
another
sort
of
hap
piness
unattainable
in
this
life
and
of
which
she
involuntarily
thought
at
that
instant
.
chapter
x
natasha
had
married
in
the
early
spring
of
1813
and
in
1820
already
had
three
daughters
besides
a
son
for
whom
she
had
longed
and
whom
she
was
now
nursing
.
she
had
grown
stouter
and
broader
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
recognize
in
this
robust
motherly
woman
the
slim
lively
natdsha
of
former
days
.
hfer
fea
tures
were
more
defined
and
had
a
calm
soft
and
serene
expression
.
in
her
face
there
was
66o
war
and
peace
none
of
the
everglowing
animation
that
had
formerly
burned
there
and
constituted
its
charm
.
now
her
face
and
body
were
often
all
that
one
saw
and
her
soul
was
not
visible
at
all
.
all
that
struck
the
eye
was
a
strong
hand
some
and
fertile
woman
.
the
old
fire
very
rarely
kindled
in
her
face
now
.
that
happened
only
when
as
was
the
case
that
day
her
hus
band
returned
home
or
a
sick
child
was
conva
lescent
or
when
she
and
countess
mary
spoke
of
prince
andrew
she
never
mentioned
him
to
her
husband
who
she
imagined
was
jealous
of
prince
andrews
memory
or
on
the
rare
occasions
when
something
happened
to
induce
her
to
sing
a
practice
she
had
quite
abandoned
since
her
marriage
.
at
the
rare
moments
when
the
old
fire
did
kindle
in
her
handsome
fully
developed
body
she
was
even
more
attractive
than
in
former
days
.
since
their
marriage
natasha
and
her
hus
band
had
lived
in
moscow
in
petersburg
on
their
estate
near
moscow
or
with
her
mother
that
is
to
say
in
nicholas
house
.
the
young
countess
beziikhova
was
not
often
seen
in
so
ciety
and
those
who
met
her
there
were
not
pleased
with
her
and
found
her
neither
at
tractive
nor
amiable
.
not
that
natasha
liked
solitude
she
did
not
know
whether
she
liked
it
or
not
she
even
thought
that
she
did
riot
but
with
her
pregnancies
her
confinements
the
nursing
of
her
children
and
sharing
every
moment
of
her
husbands
life
she
had
de
mands
on
her
time
which
could
be
satisfied
only
byrenouncingsociety
.
all
who
had
known
natasha
before
her
marriage
wondered
at
the
change
in
her
as
at
something
extraordinary
.
only
the
old
countess
with
her
maternal
in
stinct
had
realized
that
all
natashas
outbursts
had
been
due
to
her
need
of
children
and
a
husband
as
she
herself
had
once
exclaimed
at
otradnoe
not
so
much
in
fun
as
in
earnest
and
her
mother
was
now
surprised
at
the
sur
prise
expressed
by
those
who
had
never
under
stood
natasha
and
she
kept
saying
that
she
had
always
known
that
natasha
would
make
an
exemplary
wife
and
mother
.
only
she
lets
her
love
of
her
husband
and
children
overflow
all
bounds
said
the
count
ess
so
that
it
even
becomes
absurd
.
natasha
did
not
follow
the
golden
rule
ad
vocated
by
clever
folk
especially
by
the
french
which
says
that
a
girl
should
not
let
herself
go
when
she
marries
should
not
neglect
her
ac
complishments
should
be
even
more
careful
of
her
appearance
than
when
she
was
unmar
ried
and
should
fascinate
her
husband
as
much
as
she
did
before
he
became
her
husband
.
na
tasha
on
the
contrary
had
at
once
abandoned
all
her
witchery
of
which
her
singing
had
been
an
unusually
powerful
part
.
she
gave
it
up
just
because
it
was
so
powerfully
seductive
.
she
took
no
pains
with
her
manners
or
with
delicacy
of
speech
or
with
her
toilet
or
to
show
herself
to
her
husband
in
her
most
becoming
attitudes
or
to
avoid
inconveniencing
him
by
being
too
exacting
.
she
acted
in
contradic
tion
to
all
those
rules
.
she
felt
that
the
allure
ments
instinct
had
formerly
taught
her
to
use
would
now
be
merely
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
her
husband
to
whom
she
had
from
the
first
moment
given
herself
up
entirely
that
is
with
her
whole
soul
leaving
no
corner
of
it
hidden
from
him
.
she
felt
that
her
unity
with
her
hus
band
was
not
maintained
by
the
poetic
feel
ings
that
had
attracted
him
to
her
but
by
something
else
indefinite
but
firm
as
the
bond
between
her
own
body
and
soul
.
to
fluff
out
her
curls
put
on
fashionable
dresses
and
sing
romantic
songs
to
fascinate
her
husband
would
have
seemed
as
strange
as
to
adorn
herself
to
attract
herself
.
to
adorn
herself
for
others
might
perhaps
have
been
agreeable
she
did
not
know
but
she
had
no
time
at
all
for
it
.
the
chief
reason
for
devoting
no
time
either
to
singing
to
dress
or
to
choos
ing
her
words
was
that
she
really
had
no
time
to
spare
for
these
things
.
we
know
that
man
has
the
faculty
of
becom
ing
completely
absorbed
in
a
subject
however
trivial
it
may
be
and
that
there
is
no
subject
so
trivial
that
it
will
not
grow
to
infinite
propor
tions
if
ones
entire
attention
is
devoted
to
it
.
the
subject
which
wholly
engrossed
nata
shas
attention
was
her
family
that
is
her
hus
band
whom
she
had
to
keep
so
that
he
should
belong
entirely
to
her
and
to
the
home
and
the
children
whom
she
had
to
bear
bring
into
the
world
nurse
and
bring
up
.
and
the
deeper
she
penetrated
not
with
her
mind
only
but
with
her
whole
soul
her
whole
being
into
the
subject
that
absorbed
her
the
larger
did
that
subject
grow
and
the
weaker
and
more
inadequate
did
her
own
pow
ers
appear
so
that
she
concentrated
them
whol
ly
on
that
one
thing
and
yet
was
unable
to
ac
complish
all
that
she
considered
necessary
.
there
were
then
as
now
conversations
and
discussions
about
womens
rights
the
relations
of
husband
and
wife
and
their
freedom
and
rights
though
these
themes
were
not
yet
teamed
questions
as
they
are
now
but
these
topics
were
not
merely
uninteresting
to
na
first
epilogue
661
tdsha
she
positively
did
not
understand
them
.
these
questions
then
as
now
existed
only
for
those
who
see
nothing
in
marriage
but
the
pleasure
married
people
get
from
one
another
that
is
only
the
beginnings
of
marriage
and
not
its
whole
significance
which
lies
in
the
family
.
discussions
and
questions
of
that
kind
which
are
like
the
question
of
how
to
get
the
greatest
gratification
from
ones
dinner
did
not
then
and
do
not
now
exist
for
those
for
whom
the
purpose
of
a
dinner
is
the
nourishment
it
af
fords
and
the
purpose
of
marriage
is
the
fam
ily
.
if
the
purpose
of
dinner
is
to
nourish
the
body
a
man
who
eats
two
dinners
at
once
may
perhaps
get
more
enjoyment
but
will

di
gest
the
two
dinners
.
if
the
purpose
of
marriage
is
the
family
the
person
who
wishes
to
have
many
wives
or
hus
bands
may
perhaps
obtain
much
pleasure
but
in
that
case
will
not
have
a
family
.
if
the
purpose
of
food
is
nourishment
and
the
purpose
of
marriage
is
the
family
the
whole
question
resolves
itself
into
not
eating
more
than
one
can
digest
and
not
having
more
wives
or
husbands
than
are
needed
for
the
family
that
is
one
wife
or
one
husband
.
natisha
need
ed
a
husband
.
a
husband
was
given
her
and
he
gave
her
a
family
.
and
she
not
only
saw
no
need
of
any
other
or
better
husband
but
as
all
the
powers
of
her
soul
were
intent
on
serving
that
husband
and
family
she
could
not
imag
ine
and
saw
no
interest
in
imagining
how
it
would
be
if
things
were
different
.
natasha
did
not
care
for
society
in
general
but
prized
the
more
the
society
of
her
rela
tivescountess
mary
and
her
brother
her
mother
and
s6nya
.
she
valued
the
company
of
those
to
whom
she
could
come
striding
di
sheveled
from
the
nursery
in
her
dressing
gown
and
with
joyful
face
show
a
yellow
instead
of
a
green
stain
on
babys
napkin
and
from
whom
she
could
hear
reassuring
words
to
the
effect
that
baby
was
much
better
.
to
such
an
extent
had
natasha
let
herself
go
that
the
way
she
dressed
and
did
her
hair
her
illchosen
words
and
her
jealousy
she
was
jealouiof
s6nya
of
the
governess
and
of
every
woman
pretty
or
plain
were
habitual
sub
jects
of
jest
to
those
about
her
.
the
general
opinion
was
that
pierre
was
under
his
wifes
thumb
which
was
really
true
.
from
the
very
first
days
of
their
married
life
natasha
had
an
nounced
her
demands
.
pierre
was
greatly
sur
prised
by
his
wifes
view
to
him
a
perfectly
novel
one
that
every
moment
of
his
life
be
longed
to
her
and
to
the
family
.
his
wifes
de
mands
astonished
him
but
they
also
flattered
him
and
he
submitted
to
them
.
pierres
subjection
consisted
in
the
fact
that
he
not
only
dared
not
flirt
with
but
dared
not
even
speak
smilingly
to
any
other
woman
did
not
dare
dine
at
the
club
as
a
pastime
did
not
dare
spend
money
on
a
whim
and
did
not
dare
absent
himself
for
any
length
of
time
except
on
business
in
which
his
wife
included
his
in
tellectual
pursuits
which
she
did
not
in
the
least
understand
but
to
which
she
attributed
great
importance
.
to
make
up
for
this
at
home
pierre
had
the
right
to
regulate
his
life
and
that
of
the
whole
family
exactly
as
he
chose
.
at
home
natdsha
placed
herself
in
the
position
of
a
slave
to
her
husband
and
the
whole
household
went
on
tiptoe
when
he
was
occupied
that
is
was
reading
or
writing
in
his
study
.
pierre
had
but
to
show
a
partiality
for
anything
to
get
just
what
he
liked
done
always
.
he
had
only
to
express
a
wish
and
natasha
would
jump
up
and
run
to
fulfill
it
.
the
entire
household
was
governed
accord
ing
to
pierres
supposed
orders
that
is
by
his
wishes
which
natasha
tried
to
guess
.
their
way
of
life
and
place
of
residence
their
ac
quaintances
and
ties
natashas
occupations
the
childrens
upbringing
were
all
selected
not
merely
with
regard
to
pierres
expressed
wishes
but
to
what
natasha
from
the
thoughts
he
ex
pressed
in
conversation
supposed
his
wishes
to
be
.
and
she
deduced
the
essentials
of
his
wish
es
quite
correctly
and
having
once
arrived
at
them
clung
to
them
tenaciously
.
when
pierre
himself
wanted
to
change
his
mind
she
would
fight
him
with
his
own
weapons
.
thus
in
a
time
of
trouble
ever
memorable
to
him
after
the
birth
of
their
first
child
who
was
delicate
when
they
had
to
change
the
wet
nurse
three
times
and
natdsha
fell
ill
from
de
spair
pierre
one
day
told
her
of
rousseaus
view
with
which
he
quite
agreed
that
to
have
a
wet
nurse
is
unnatural
and
harmful
.
when
her
next
baby
was
born
despite
the
opposi
tion
of
her
mother
the
doctors
and
even
of
her
husband
himself
who
were
all
vigorously
opposed
to
her
nursing
her
baby
herself
a
thing
then
unheard
of
and
considered
injuri
ousshe
insisted
on
having
her
own
way
and
after
that
nursed
all
her
babies
herself
.
it
very
often
happened
that
in
a
moment
of
irritation
husband
and
wife
would
have
a
dis
pute
but
long
afterwards
pierre
to
his
sur
662
war
and
peace
prise
and
delight
would
find
in
his
wifes
ideas
and
actions
the
very
thought
against
which
she
had
argued
but
divested
of
everything
super
fluous
that
in
the
excitement
of
the
dispute
he
had
added
when
expressing
his
opinion
.
after
seven
years
of
marriage
pierre
had
the
joyous
and
firm
consciousness
that
he
was
not
a
bad
man
and
he
felt
this
because
he
saw
himself
reflected
in
his
wife
.
he
felt
the
good
and
bad
within
himself
inextricably
mingled
and
overlapping
.
but
only
what
was
really
good
in
him
was
reflected
in
his
wife
all
that
was
not
quite
good
was
rejected
.
and
this
was
not
the
result
of
logical
reasoning
but
was
a
direct
and
mysterious
reflection
.
chapter
xi
two
months
previously
when
pierre
was
al
ready
staying
with
the
rost6vs
he
had
received
a
letter
from
prince
theodore
asking
him
to
come
to
petersburg
to
confer
on
some
impor
tant
questions
that
were
being
discussed
there
by
a
society
of
which
pierre
was
one
of
the
principal
founders
.
on
reading
that
letter
she
always
read
her
husbands
letters
natdsha
herself
suggested
that
he
should
go
to
petersburg
though
she
would
feel
his
absence
very
acutely
.
she
at
tributed
immense
importance
to
all
her
hus
bands
intellectual
and
abstract
interests
though
she
did
not
understand
them
and
she
always
dreaded
being
a
hindrance
to
him
in
such
matters
.
to
pierres
timid
look
of
inquiry
after
reading
the
letter
she
replied
by
asking
him
to
go
but
to
fix
a
definite
date
for
his
re
turn
.
he
was
given
four
weeks
leave
of
ab
sence
.
ever
since
that
leave
of
absence
had
expired
more
than
a
fortnight
before
natasha
had
been
in
a
constant
state
of
alarm
depression
and
irritability
.
denisov
now
a
general
on
the
retired
list
and
much
dissatisfied
with
the
present
state
of
affairs
had
arrived
during
that
fortnight
.
he
looked
at
natasha
with
sorrow
and
surprise
as
at
a
bad
likeness
of
a
person
once
dear
.
a
dull
dejected
look
random
replies
and
talk
about
the
nursery
was
all
he
saw
and
heard
from
his
former
enchantress
.
natasha
was
sad
and
irritable
all
that
time
especially
when
her
mother
her
brother
s6nya
or
countess
mary
in
their
efforts
to
console
her
tried
to
excuse
pierre
and
suggested
reasons
for
his
delay
in
returning
.
its
all
nonsense
all
rubbish
those
discus
sions
which
lead
to
nothing
and
all
those
idi
otic
societies
natasha
declared
of
the
very
af
fairs
in
the
immense
importance
of
which
she
firmly
believed
.
and
she
would
go
to
the
nursery
to
nurse
p6tya
her
only
boy
.
no
one
else
could
tell
her
anything
so
comforting
or
so
reasonable
as
this
little
threemonthold
creature
when
he
lay
at
her
breast
and
she
was
conscious
of
the
movement
of
his
lips
and
the
snuffling
of
his
little
nose
.
that
creature
said
you
are
angry
you
are
jealous
you
would
like
to
pay
him
out
you
are
afraidbut
here
am
ii
and
i
am
he

.

.

.
and
that
was
unanswerable
.
it
was
more
than
true
.
during
that
fortnight
of
anxiety
natasha
resorted
to
the
baby
for
comfort
so
often
and
fussed
over
him
so
much
that
she
overfed
him
and
he
fell
ill
.
she
was
terrified
by
his
illness
and
yet
that
was
just
what
she
needed
.
while
attending
to
him
she
bore
the
anxiety
about
her
husband
more
easily
.
she
was
nursing
her
boy
when
the
sound
of
pierres
sleigh
was
heard
at
the
front
door
and
the
old
nurse
knowing
how
to
please
her
mis
tressentered
the
room
inaudibly
but
hurried
ly
and
with
a
beaming
face
.
has
he
come
natdsha
asked
quickly
in
a
whisper
afraid
to
move
lest
she
should
rouse
the
dozing
baby
.
hes
come
maam
whispered
the
nurse
.
the
blood
rushed
to
natdshas
face
and
her
feet
involuntarily
moved
but
she
could
not
jump
up
and
run
out
.
the
baby
again
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
.
youre
here
he
seemed
to
be
saying
and
again
lazily
smacked
his
lips
.
cautiously
withdrawing
her
breast
natdsha
rocked
him
a
little
handed
him
to
the
nurse
and
went
with
rapid
steps
toward
the
door
.
but
at
the
door
she
stopped
as
if
her
conscience
reproached
her
for
having
in
her
joy
left
the
child
too
soon
and
she
glanced
round
.
the
nurse
with
raised
elbows
was
lifting
the
in
fant
over
the
rail
of
his
cot
.
go
maaml
dont
worry
go
she
whis
pered
smiling
with
the
kind
of
familiarity
that
grows
up
between
a
nurse
and
her
mis
tress
.
natdsha
ran
with
light
footsteps
to
the
ante
room
.
denfsov
who
had
come
out
of
the
study
in
to
the
dancing
room
with
his
pipe
now
for
the
first
time
recognized
the
old
natdsha
.
a
flood
of
brilliant
joyful
light
poured
from
her
trans
figured
face
.
hes
come
she
exclaimed
as
she
ran
past
first
epilogue
and
denfsov
felt
that
he
too
was
delighted
that
pierre
whom
he
did
not
much
care
for
had
re
turned
.
on
reaching
the
vestibule
natasha
saw
a
tall
figure
in
a
fur
coat
unwinding
his
scarf
.
its
he
its
really
hel
he
has
come
she
said
to
herself
and
rushing
at
him
embraced
him
pressed
his
head
to
her
breast
and
then
pushed
him
back
and
gazed
at
his
ruddy
happy
face
covered
with
hoarfrost
.
yes
it
is
he
happy
and
contented
.

.

.

.
then
all
at
once
she
remembered
the
tor
tures
of
suspense
she
had
experienced
for
the
last
fortnight
and
the
joy
that
had
lit
up
her
face
vanished
she
frowned
and
overwhelmed
pierre
with
a
torrent
of
reproaches
and
angry
words
.
yes
its
all
very
well
for
you
.
you
are
pleased
youve
had
a
good
time
.

.

.

.
but
what
about
me
you
might
at
least
have
shown
con
sideration
for
the
children
.
i
am
nursing
and
my
milk
was
spoiled
.

.

.

.
pckya
was
at
deaths
door
.
but
you
were
enjoying
yourself
.
yes
en
joying

.

.

.
pierre
knew
he
was
not
to
blame
for
he
could
not
have
come
sooner
he
knew
this
out
burst
was
unseemly
and
would
blow
over
in
a
minute
or
two
above
all
he
knew
that
he
him
self
was
bright
and
happy
.
he
wanted
to
smile
but
dared
not
even
think
of
doing
so
.
he
made
a
piteous
frightened
face
and
bent
down
.
i
could
not
on
my
honor
.
but
how
is
pet
ya
all
right
now
.
come
along
i
wonder
youre
not
ashamed
if
only
you
could
see
what
i
was
like
without
you
how
i
suffered
you
are
well
come
come
she
said
not
letting
go
of
his
arm
.
and
they
went
to
their
rooms
.
when
nicholas
and
his
wife
came
to
look
for
pierre
he
was
in
the
nursery
holding
his
baby
son
who
was
again
awake
on
his
huge
right
palm
and
dandling
him
.
a
blissful
bright
smile
was
fixed
on
the
babys
broad
face
with
its
toothless
open
mouth
.
the
storm
was
long
since
over
and
there
was
bright
joyous
sun
shine
on
natashas
face
as
she
gazed
tenderly
at
her
husband
and
child
.
and
have
you
talked
everything
well
over
with
prince
theodore
she
asked
.
yes
capitally
.
you
see
he
holds
it
up
.
she
meant
the
babys
head
.
but
how
he
did
frighten
me

..
.
youve
seen
the
princess
is
it
true
shes
in
love
with
that

.

.

.
yes
just
fancy

663
at
that
moment
nicholas
and
countess
mary
came
in
.
pierre
with
the
baby
on
his
hand
stooped
kissed
them
and
replied
to
their
inquiries
.
but
in
spite
of
much
that
was
interesting
and
had
to
be
discussed
the
baby
with
the
little
cap
on
its
unsteady
head
evi
dently
absorbed
all
his
attention
.
how
sweet
said
countess
mary
looking
at
and
playing
with
the
baby
.
now
nicholas
she
added
turning
to
her
husband
i
cant
understand
how
it
is
you
dont
see
the
charm
of
these
delicious
marvels
.
i
dont
and

nicholas

coldly
at

lump
of

along
pierre
and
yet
hes
such
an
affectionate

said
countess

vindicating
her
husband
but
only
after
they
are
a
year
old
or
so

now
pierre

them
splendidly
said
natasha

he
says
his

for

pierre
suddenly
ex
claimed
with
a
laugh
and
shifting
the
baby
he
gave
him
to
the
nurse
.
chapter
xii
as
in
every
large
household
there
were
at
bald
hills
several
perfectly
distinct
worlds
which
merged
into
one
harmonious
whole
though
each
retained
its
own
peculiarities
and
made
concessions
to
the
others
.
every
event
joyful
or
sad
that
took
place
in
that
house
was
important
to
all
these
worlds
but
each
had
its
own
special
reasons
to
rejoice
or
grieve
over
that
occurrence
independently
of
the
others
.
for
instance
pierres
return
was
a
joyful
and
important
event
and
they
all
felt
it
to
be
so
.
the

the
most
reliable
judges
of
their
masters
because
they
judge
not
by
their
conversation
or
expressions
of
feeling
but
by
their
acts
and
way
of
life
were
glad
of
pierres
return
because
they
knew
that
when
he
was
there
count
nicholas
would
cease
going
every
day
to
attend
to
the
estate
and
would
be
in
bet
ter
spirits
and
temper
and
also
because
they
would
all
receive
handsome
presents
for
the
holidays
.
the
children
and
their
governesses
were
glad
of
pierres
return
because
no
one
else
drew
them
into
the
social
life
of
the
household
as
he
did
.
he
alone
could
play
on
the
clavichord
that
dcossaise
his
only
piece
to
which
as
he
said
all
possible
dances
could
be
danced
and
they
felt
sure
he
had
brought
presents
for
them
all

because

rapturous
and

no

had
instilled
into
him
this
love
for

he
saw
only
occasionally

had
brought
him
up
had
done
her

to
make
him

her

she

and
was
breathless
when
pierre
spoke
to
him
.
he
did
not
miss
a
single
word
he
uttered
and
would
afterwards
with
dessal
les
or
by
himself
recall
and
reconsider
the
meaningof
everything
pierre
had
said
.

past

and
his
unhappiness

of
which
young
nicholas
had
formed
a
vague
po
etic
picture
from
some
words
he
had
overheard
his
adventures
in
moscow
his
captivity
plat6n
karataev
of
whom
he
had
heard
from
pierre
his
love
for
natdsha
of
whom
the
lad
was
also
particularly
fond
and
especially
pierres
friendship
with
the
father
whom
nicholas
could
not
remember
all
this
made
pierre
in
his
eyes
a
hero
and
a
saint
.
from
broken
remarks
about
natasha
and
his
father
from
the
emotion
with
which
pierre
spoke
of
that
dead
father
and
from
the
careful
reverent
tenderness
with
which
natdsha
spoke
of
him
the
boy
who
was
only
just
beginning
to
guess
what
love
is
derived
the
notion
that
his
father
had
loved
natdsha
and
when
dying
had
left
her
to
his
friend
.
but
the
father
whom
the
boy
did
not
remember
appeared
to
him
a
divinity
who
could
not
be
pictured
and
of
whom
he
never
thought
without
a
swelling
heart
and
tears
of
sadness
and
rapture
.
so
the
boy
also
was
happy
that
pierre
had
arrived
.
the
guests
welcomed
pierre
because
he
al
ways
helped
to
enliven
and
unite
any
company
he
was
in
.
the
grownup
members
of
the
family
not
to
mention
his
wife
were
pleased
to
have
back
a
friend
whose
presence
made
life
run
more
smoothly
and
peacefully
.
the
old
ladies
were
pleased
with
the
pres
ents
he
brought
them
and
especially
that
na
tdsha
would
now
be
herself
again
.
pierre
felt
the
different
outlooks
of
these
various
worlds
and
made
haste
to
satisfy
all
their
expectations
.
though
the
most
absentminded
and
for
getful
of
men
pierre
with
the
aid
of
a
list
his
wife
drew
up
had
now
bought
everything
not
forgetting
his
motherand
brotherinlaws
com
missions
nor
the
dress
material
for
a
present
to
bel6va
nor
toys
for
his
wifes
nephews
.
in
the
early
days
of
his
marriage
it
had
seemed
strange
to
him
that
his
wife
should
expect
him
not
to
forget
to
procure
all
the
things
he
under
took
to
buy
and
he
had
been
taken
aback
by
her
serious
annoyance
when
on
his
first
trip
he
forgot
everything
.
but
in
time
he
grew
used
to
this
demand
.
knowing
that
natasha
asked
nothing
for
herself
and
gave
him
commissions
for
others
only
when
he
himself
had
offered
to
undertake
them
he
now
found
an
unexpected
and
childlike
pleasure
in
this
purchase
of
presents
for
everyone
in
the
house
and
never
forgot
anything
.
if
he
now
incurred
natashas
censure
it
was
only
for
buying
too
many
and
too
expensive
things
.
to
her
other
defects
as
most
people
thought
them
but
which
to
pierre
were
qualities
of
untidiness
and
neglect
of
herself
she
now
added
stinginess
.
from
the
time
that
pierre
began
life
as
a
family
man
on
a
footing
entailing
heavy
ex
penditure
he
had
noticed
to
his
surprise
that
he
spent
only
half
as
much
as
before
and
that
his
affairs
which
had
been
in
disorder
of
late
chiefly
because
of
his
first
wifes
debts
had
be
gun
to
improve
.
life
was
cheaper
because
it
was
circum
scribed
that
most
expensive
luxury
the
kind
of
life
that
can
be
changed
at
any
moment
was
no
longer
his
nor
did
he
wish
for
it
.
he
felt
that
his
way
of
life
had
now
been
settled
once
for
all
till
death
and
that
to
change
it
was
not
in
his
power
and
so
that
way
of
life
proved
economical
.
with
a
merry
smiling
face
pierre
was
sort
ing
his
purchases
.
what
do
you
think
of
this
said
he
un
rolling
a
piece
of
stuff
like
a
shopman
.
natasha
who
was
sitting
opposite
to
him
with
her
eldest
daughter
on
her
lap
turned
her
sparkling
eyes
swiftly
from
her
husband
to
the
things
he
showed
her
.
thats
for
bel6va
excellentl
she
felt
the
quality
of
the
material
.
it
was
a
ruble
an
ar
shin
i
suppose
pierre
told
her
the
price
.
too
dear
natdsha
remarked
.
how
pleased
the
children
will
be
and
mamma
too
only
you
need
not
have
bought
me
this
she
added
unable
to
suppress
a
smile
as
she
gazed
admiringly
at
a
gold
comb
set
with
pearls
of
first
epilogue
a
kind
then
just
coming
into
fashion
.
adele
tempted
me
she
kept
on
telling
me
to
buy
it
returned
pierre
.
when
am
i
to
wear
it
and
natdsha
stuck
it
in
her
coil
of
hair
.
when
i
take
little
mdsha
into
society
perhaps
they
will
be
fashionable
again
by
then
.
well
lets
go
now
.
and
collecting
the
presents
they
went
first
to
the
nursery
and
then
to
the
old
countess
rooms
.
the
countess
was
sitting
with
her
companion
bel6va
playing
grandpatience
as
usual
when
pierre
and
natdsha
came
into
the
drawing
room
with
parcels
under
their
arms
.
the
countess
was
now
over
sixty
was
quite
gray
and
wore
a
cap
with
a
frill
that
sur
rounded
her
face
.
her
face
had
shriveled
her
upper
lip
had
sunk
in
and
her
eyes
were
dim
.
after
the
deaths
of
her
son
and
husband
in
such
rapid
succession
she
felt
herself
a
being
accidentally
forgotten
in
this
world
and
left
without
aim
or
object
for
her
existence
.
she
ate
drank
slept
or
kept
awake
but
did
not
live
.
life
gave
her
no
new
impressions
.
she
wanted
nothing
from
life
but
tranquillity
and
that
tranquillity
only
death
could
give
her
.
but
until
death
came
she
had
to
go
on
living
that
is
to
use
her
vital
forces
.
a
peculiarity
one
sees
in
very
young
children
and
very
old
people
was
particularly
evident
in
her
.
her
life
had
no
external
aims
only
a
need
to
exercise
her
various
functions
and
inclinations
was
ap
parent
.
she
had
to
eat
sleep
think
speak
weep
work
give
vent
to
her
anger
and
so
on
merely
because
she
had
a
stomach
a
brain
muscles
nerves
and
a
liver
.
she
did
these
things
not
under
any
external
impulse
as
people
in
the
full
vigor
of
life
do
when
behind
the
purpose
for
which
they
strive
that
of
exercising
their
functions
remains
unnoticed
.
she
talked
only
because
she
physically
needed
to
exercise
her
tongue
and
lungs
.
she
cried
as
a
child
does
be
cause
her
nose
had
to
be
cleared
and
so
on
.
what
for
people
in
their
full
vigor
is
an
aim
was
for
her
evidently
merely
a
pretext
.
thus
in
the
morning
especially
if
she
had
eaten
anything
rich
the
day
before
she
felt
a
need
of
being
angry
and
would
choose
as
the
handiest
pretext
beksvas
deafness
.
she
would
begin
to
say
something
to
her
in
a
low
tone
from
the
other
end
of
die
room
.
it
seems
a
little
warmer
today
my
dear
she
would
murmur
.
and
when
bel6va
replied
oh
yes
theyve
come
she
would
mutter
angrily
o
lord
how
stupid
and
deaf
she
is
another
pretext
would
be
her
snuff
which
would
seem
too
dry
or
too
damp
or
not
rubbed
fine
enough
.
after
these
fits
of
irritability
her
face
would
grow
yellow
and
her
maids
knew
by
infallible
symptoms
when
bel6va
would
again
be
deaf
the
snuff
damp
and
the
count
ess
face
yellow
.
just
as
she
needed
to
work
off
her
spleen
so
she
had
sometimes
to
exercise
her
stillexisting
faculty
of
thinking
and
the
pre
text
for
that
was
a
game
of
patience
.
when
she
needed
to
cry
the
deceased
count
would
be
the
pretext
.
when
she
wanted
to
be
agitated
nicholas
and
his
health
would
be
the
pretext
and
when
she
felt
a
need
to
speak
spitefully
the
pretext
would
be
countess
mary
.
when
her
vocal
organs
needed
exercise
which
was
usually
toward
seven
oclock
when
she
had
had
an
afterdinner
rest
in
a
darkened
room
the
pretext
would
be
the
retelling
of
the
same
stories
over
and
over
again
to
the
same
audi
ence
.
the
old
ladys
condition
was
understood
by
the
whole
household
though
no
one
ever
spoke
of
it
and
they
all
made
every
possible
effort
to
satisfy
her
needs
.
only
by
a
rare
glance
ex
changed
with
a
sad
smile
between
nicholas
pierre
natdsha
and
countess
mary
was
the
common
understanding
of
her
condition
ex
pressed
.
but
those
glances
expressed
something
more
they
said
that
she
had
played
her
part
in
life
that
what
they
now
saw
was
not
her
whole
self
that
we
must
all
become
like
her
and
that
they
were
glad
to
yield
to
her
to
re
strain
themselves
for
this
once
precious
being
formerly
as
full
of
life
as
themselves
but
now
so
much
to
be
pitied
.
memento
mori
said
these
glances
.
only
the
really
heartless
the
stupid
ones
of
that
household
and
the
little
children
failed
to
understand
this
and
avoided
her
.
chapter
xiii
when
pierre
and
his
wife
entered
thedrawing
room
the
countess
was
in
one
of
her
customary
states
in
which
she
needed
the
mental
exertion
of
playing
patience
and
so
though
by
force
of
habit
she
greeted
him
with
the
words
she
al
ways
used
when
pierre
or
her
son
returned
aft
er
an
absence
high
time
my
dear
high
time
we
were
all
weary
of
waiting
for
you
.
well
thank
god
and
received
her
presents
with
another
customary
remark
its
not
the
gift
thats
precious
my
dear
but
that
you
give
it
to
me
an
old
woman

.

.

.yet
it
was
evident
that
she
was
not
pleased
by
pierres
arrival
at
666
war
and
peace
that
moment
when
it
diverted
her
attention
from
the
unfinished
game
.
she
finished
her
game
of
patience
and
only
then
examined
the
presents
.
they
consisted
of
a
box
for
cards
of
splendid
workmanship
a
brightblue
sevres
tea
cup
with
shepherdesses
depicted
on
it
and
with
a
lid
and
a
gold
snuff
box
with
the
counts
portrait
on
the
lid
which
pierre
had
had
done
by
a
miniaturist
in
pe
tersburg
.
the
countess
had
long
wished
for
such
a
box
but
as
she
did
not
want
to
cry
just
then
she
glanced
indifferently
at
the
portrait
and
gave
her
attention
chiefly
to
the
box
for
cards
.
thank
you
my
dear
you
have
cheered
me
up
said
she
as
she
always
did
.
but
best
of
all
you
have
brought
yourself
back
for
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
you
ought
to
give
your
wife
a
scolding

to
do
with
her

woman
when

though
pierre
natdsha
nicholas
countess
mary
and
denfsov
had
much
to
talk
about
that
they
could
not
discuss
before
the
old
countess
not
that
anything
was
hidden
from
her
but
because
she
had
dropped
so
far
be
hindhand
in
many
things
that
had
they
begun
to
converse
in
her
presence
they
would
have
had
to
answer
inopportune
questions
and
to
repeat
what
they
had
already
told
her
many
times
that
soandso
was
dead
and
soandso
was
married
which
she
would
again
be
unable
to
remember
yet
they
sat
at
tea
round
the
samovar
in
the
drawing
room
from
habit
and
pierre
answered
the
countess
questions
as
to
whether
prince
vasili
had
aged
and
whether
countess
mary
alexdevna
had
sent
greetings
and
still
thought
of
them
arid
other
matters
that
interested
no
one
and
to
which
she
herself
was
indifferent
.
conversation
of
this
kind
interesting
to
no
one
yet
unavoidable
continued
all
through
teatime
.
all
the
grownup
members
of
the
fam
ily
were
assembled
near
the
round
tea
table
at
which
s6nya
presided
beside
the
samovar
.
the
children
with
their
tutors
and
governesses
had
had
tea
and
their
voices
were
audible
from
the
next
room
.
at
tea
all
sat
in
their
accustomed
places
nicholas
beside
the
stove
at
a
small

where
his

was

a
quite
gray

on

pierre
sat
between
his
wife
and
the
old
countess
.
he
spoke
of
what
heknew
might
interest
the
old
lady
and
that
she
could
understand
.
he
told
her
of
external
social
events
and
of
the
people
who
had
formed
the
circle
of
her
contemporaries
and
had
once
been
a
real
living
and
distinct
group
but
who
were
now
for
the
most
part
scattered
about
the
world
and
like
herself
were
garnering
the
last
ears
of
the
harvests
they
had
sown
in
earlier
years
.
but
to
the
old
countess
those
contemporaries
of
hers
seemed
to
be
the
only
serious
and
real
so
ciety
.
natasha
saw
by
pierres
animation
that
his
visit
had
been
interesting
and
that
he
had
much
to
tell
them
but
dare
not
say
it
before
the
old
countess
.
denisov
not
being
a
member
of
the
family
did
not
understand
pierres
cau
tion
and
being
as
a
malcontent
much
inter
ested
in
what
was
occurring
in
petersburg
kept
urging
pierre
to
tell
them
about
what
had
happened
in
the
semenovsk
regiment
then
about
arakchdev
and
then
about
the
bible

.
once
or
twice
pierre
was
carried
away
and
began
to

of
these
things

the

that
followed
was
broken
by

pierre
jumping
up

you

he
added
stopping
at
the
door
why
im
especially
fond
of
that
music
it
is
always
the
first
thing
that
tells
me
all
is
well
.
when
i
was
driving
here
today
the
nearer
i
got
to
the
house
the
more
anxious
i
grew
.
as
i
entered
the
anteroom
i
heard
andnishas
peals
of
laughter
and
that
meant
that
all
was
well
.
i
know

that
feeling
said

but
i
mustnt
go
there
those
stockings
are
to
be
a
surprise
for
me
.
pierre
went
to
the
children
and
the
shout
ing
and
laughter
grew
still
louder
.
come
anna

pierres
voice
was
heard
saying
come
here
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
at
the
word
of
command
one

said
pierre
and
a
silence
followed
three
and
a
rapturously
breathless
cry
of
childrens
voices
filled
the
room
.
two
two
they
shouted
.
this
meant
two
stockings
which
by
a
secret
process
known
only
to
herself
anna
makrov
na
used
to
knit
at
the
same
time
on
the
same
needles
and
which
when
they
were
ready
she
always
triumphantly
drew
one
out
of
the
oth
er
in
the

soon
after
this
the
children
came
in
to
say
good
night
.
they
kissed
everyone
the
tutors
and
governesses
made
their
bows
and
they
went
out
.
only
young
nicholas
and
his

remained
.

to
the

to

his

at

and
turned
to

pierre
giving
his

to

he
turned
to

with
a

my

asked
the
boy
flushing
crimson
and
looking
up
at
pierre
with
bright
ecstatic
eyes
.
pierre
nodded
and
went
on
with
what
he
had
been
saying
when
the
children
had
inter
rupted
.
countess
mary
sat
down
doing
wool
work
natasha
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
her
husband
.
nicholas
and
dcnfsov
rose
asked
for
their
pipes
smoked
went
to
fetch
more
tea
from
sonya
who
sat
weary
but
resolute
at
the
samovar
and
questioned
pierre
.
the
curly
headed
delicate
boy
sat
with
shining
eyes
un
noticed
in
a
corner
starting
every
now
and
then
and
muttering
something
to
himself
and
evidently
experiencing
a
new
and
powerful
emotion
as
he
turned
his
curly
head
with
his
thin
neck
exposed
by
his
turndown
collar
to
ward
the
place
where
pierre
sat
.
the
conversation
turned
on
the
contempo
rary
gossip
about
those
in
power
in
which
most
people
see
the
chief
interest
of
home
politics
.
denfsov
dissatisfied
with
the
govern
ment
on
account
of
his
own
disappointments
in
the
service
heard
with
pleasure
of
the
things
done
in
petersburg
which
seemed
to
him
stu
pid
and
made
forcible
and
sharp
comments
on
what
pierre
told
them
.
one
used
to
have
to
be
a
german
now
one
must
dance
with
tatawinova
and
madame
kwiidener
and
wead
eckatshausen
and
the
bwethwen
.
oh
they
should
let
that
fine
fellow
bonaparte
lose
hed
knock
all
this
nonsense
out
of
them
fancy
giving
the
command
of
the
semenov
wegiment
to
a
fellow
like
that
schwatz
he
cried
.
nicholas
though
free
from
denfsovs
readi
ness
to
find
fault
with
everything
also
thought
that
discussion
of
the
government
was
a
very
serious
and
weighty
matter
and
the
fact
that
668
war
and
peace
a
had
been
appointed
minister
of
this
and
b
governor
general
of
that
and
that
the
emperor
had
said
soandso
and
this
minister
soandso
seemed
to
him
very
important
.
and
so
he
thought
it
necessary
to
take
an
interest
in
these
things
and
to
question
pierre
.
the
questions
put
by
these
two
kept
the
conversa
tion
from
changing
its
ordinary
character
of
gossip
about
the
higher
government
circles
.
but
natdsha
knowing
all
her
husbands
ways
and
ideas
saw
that
he
had
long
been
wishing
but
had
been
unable
to
divert
the
conversa
tion
to
another
channel
and
express
his
own
deeply
felt
idea
for
the
sake
of
which
he
had
gone
to
petersburg
to
consult
with
his
new
friend
prince
theodore
and
she
helped
him
by
asking
how
his
affairs
with
prince
theodore
had
gone
.

what
was
it
about
asked
nicholas
.
always
the
same
thing
said
pierre
look
ing
round
at
his
listeners
.
everybody
sees
that
things
are
going
so
badly
that
they
cannot
be
allowed
to
go
on
so
and
that
it
is
the
duty
of
all
decent
men
to
counteract
it
as
far
as
they
can
.

the

countess

the

went
into
the
study
and
little
nicholas
bolk6nski
followed
them
unnoticed
by
his
uncle
and
sat
down
at
the
writing
table
in
a
shady
corner
by
the
window
.

what
would

asked
denfsov

stopping

and
lisping
the
position
in

this
the
emperor
does
not
look
into
anything
.
he
has
abandoned
himself
alto
gether
to
this
mysticism
pierre
could
not
tolerate
mysticism
in
anyone
now
.
he
seeks
only
for
peace

only

you
will

if
you
did
not
look
after
your

only
wanted

every

is

to
such
a
degree
that
it

said
pierre
as
those
who
examine
the
actions
of
any
government
have
always
said
since
governments
began
.

all
very
well

course
.
the
aim
is
excellent
but
in
the
present
cir
cumstances
something
else
is
needed
.
at
that
moment
nicholas
noticed
the
pres
ence
of
his
nephew
.
his
face
darkened
and
he
went
up
to
the
boy
.
why
are

why
let
him
be
said
pierre
taking
nich

by
the
arm
and
continuing
.
that
is
not
enough
i
told
them
.
something
else
is
needed
.
when
you
stand
expecting
the
overstrained
string
to
snap
at
any
moment
when
everyone
is
expecting
the
inevitable
catastrophe
as
many
as
possible
must
join
hands
as
closely
as
they
can
to
withstand
the
general
calamity

everything
that
is
young
and
strong
is
being
enticed
away
and
depraved
.
one
is
lured
by
women
another
by
honors
a
third
by
ambi
tion
or
money
and
they
go
over
to
that
camp
.
no
independent
men
such
as
you
or
i
are
left
.
what
i
say
is
widen
the
scope
of
our
society
let
the
mot
dordre
be
not
virtue
alone
but
in
dependence
and
action
as

nicholas

had
left

irritably
pushed
up

sat
down

and
listened

frowning

what
aim
he
cried

and
what
position
will
you
adopt
toward
the

ernment
why
the
position

.
the
society
need
not
be
secret
if
the
government
allows
it
.
not
merely
is
it
not
hostile
to
government
but
it
is
a
society
of
true
conservatives
a
society
of
gentlemen
in
the
full
meaning
of
that
word
.
it
is
only
to
prevent
some
pugachev
or
other
from

my

it

that
made

the

with

stretching
out
from
the
turndown

whom
everyone
had
forgotten
gaed
at

with
even
great

more
rapturous
joy
.
every
word
of

burned
into
his
heart
and
with
a

movement

his
fingers
he
uncon
sciously
broke
the

his

came
upon

natdsha
began
to
laugh

nicholas
knitted
his
brows
still
more
and
be
gan
proving
to
pierre
that
there
was
no
pros
pect
of
any
great
change
and
that
all
the
dan
ger
he
spoke
of
existed
only
in
his

pierre
maintained
the
contrary
and
as
his
mental
faculties
were
greater
and
more
re
sourceful
nicholas
felt
himself
cornered
.
this
made
him
still
angrier
for
he
was
fully
con
vinced
not
by
reasoning

by
something
within
him

you

if
you
formed

began

followed

natdsha
was
the
first
to
speak
defending
her
husband
and
attacking
her
brother
.
her
de
fense
was
weak
and
inapt
but
she
attained
her
object
.
the
conversation
was
resumed
and
no
longer
in
the
unpleasantly
hostile
tone
of
nicholas
last
remark
.
when
they
all
got
up
to
go
in
to

nicholas
bolkonski
went
up
to

pale
and
with
shining
radiant
eyes

would
he
agree
with
you
he
asked
.
and
pierre
suddenly
realized
what
a
special
independent
complex
and
powerful
process
of
thought
and
feeling
must
have
been
going
on
in
this
boy
during
that
conversation
and
remembering
all
he
had
said
he
regretted
that
the
lad
should
have
heard
him
.
he
had
how
ever
to
give
him
an
answer
.
yes
i
think
so
he
said
reluctantly
and
left
the
study
.
the
lad
looked
down
and
seemed
now
for
the
first
time
to
notice
what
he
had
done
to
the
things
on
the
table
.
he
flushed
and
went
up
to
nicholas
.
uncle

he
said
pointing
to
the
broken

and
pens
.
nicholas
started
angrily
.
all
right
all
right
he
said
throwing
the
bits
under
the
table
.
and
evidently
suppressing
his
vexation
with
difficulty
he
turned
away
from
the
boy
.
you
ought
not
to
have
been
here
at
all
he
said
.

the
conversation
at
supper
was
not
about
politics
or
societies

turned
on
the
subject
nicholas
liked
best

of

about

after

nicholas
having
undressed
in
his
study
and
given
instructions
to
the
steward
who
had
been
waiting
for
him
went
to
the
bedroom
in
his
dressing
gown
where
he
found
his
wife
still
at
her
table
writing

asked

countess
mary
blushed
.
she
was
afraid
that
what
she
was
writing
would
not
be
understood
or
approved
by
her
husband
.
she
had
wanted
to
conceal
what
she
was
writing
from
him
but
at
the
same
time
was
glad
he
had
surprised
her
at
it
and
that
she
would
now
have
to
tell
him

and
obstinate
.
i
tried
threats
but
he
only
grew
angrier
.
then
i
took
the
matter
in
hand
i
left
him
alone
and
began
with
nurses
help
to
get
the
other
children
up
telling
him
that
i
did
not
love
him
.
for
a
longtime
he
was
silent
.
as
if
astonished
then
he
jumped
out
of
bed
ran
to
me
in
his
shirt
and
sobbed
so
that
i
could
not
calm
him
for
a
long
time
.
it
was
plain
that
what
troubled
him
most
was
that
he
had
grieved
me
.
afterwards
in
the
evening
when
i
gave
him
his
ticket
he
again
began
crying
piteously
and
kissing
me
.
one
can
do
any
thing
with
him
by
tenderness
.
what
is
a
ticket
nicholas
inquired
.
i
have
begun
giving
the
elder
ones
marks
every
evening
showing
how
they
have
be
haved
.
nicholas
looked
into
the
radiant
eyes
that
were
gazing
at
him
and
continued
to
turn
over
the
pages
and
read
.
in
the
diary
was
set
down
everything
in
the
childrens
lives
that
seemed
noteworthy
to
their
mother
as
showing
their
characters
or
suggesting
general
reflections
on
educational
methods
.
they
were
for
the
most
part
quite
insignificant
trifles
but
did
not
seem
so
to
the
mother
or
to
the
father
either
now
that
he
read
this
diary
about
his
children
for
the
first
time
.
under
the
date
5
was
entered
mitya
was
naughty
at
table
.
papa
said
he
was
to
have
no
pudding
.
he
had
none
but
looked
so
un
happily
and
greedily
at
the
others
while
they
were
war
and
peace
eating
i
think
that
punishment
by
depriving
chil
dren
o
sweets
only
develops
their
greediness
.
must
tell
nicholas
this
.
nicholas
put
down
the
book
and
looked
at
his
wife
.
the
radiant
eyes
gazed
at
him
ques
tioningly
would
he
approve
or
disapprove
of
her
diary
there
could
be
no
doubt
not
only
of
his
approval
but
also
of
his
admiration
for
his
wife
.
perhaps
it
need
not
be
done
so
pedantically
thought
nicholas
or
even
done
at
all
but
this
untiring
continual
spiritual
effort
of
which
the
sole
aim
was
the
childrens
moral
welfare
delighted
him
.
had
nicholas
been
able
to
ana
lyze
his
feelings
he
would
have
found
that
his
steady
tender
and
proud
love
of
his
wife
rested
on
his
feeling
of
wonder
at
her
spirituality
and
at
the
lofty
moral
world
almost
beyond
his
reach
in
which
she
had
her
being
.
he
was
proud
of
her
intelligence
and
good
ness
recognized
his
own
insignificance
beside
her
in
the
spiritual
world
and
rejoiced
all
the
more
that
she
with
such
a
soul
not
only
be
longed
to
him
but
was
part
of
himself
.
i
quite
quite
approve
my
dearest
said
he
with
a
significant
look
and
after
a
short
pause
he
added
and
i
behaved
badly
today
.
you
werent
in
the
study
.
we
began
disputing
pierre
and
i
and
i
lost
my
temper
.
but
he
is
impossible
such
a
child
i
dont
know
what
would
become
of
him
if
natasha
didnt
keep
him
in
hand
.

.

.

.
have
you
any
idea
why
he
went
to
petersburg
they
have
formed

.

.

.
yes
i
know
said
countess
mary
.
nat
sha
told
me
.
well
then
you
know
nicholas
went
on
growing
hot
at
the
mere
recollection
of
their
discussion
he
wanted
to
convince
me
that
it
is
every
honest
mans
duty
to
go
against
the
government
and
that
the
oath
of
allegiance
and
duty

..
.
i
am
sorry
you
werent
there
.
they
all
fell
on
me
denfsov
and
natasha

.

.

.
natasha
is
absurd
.
how
she
rules
over
him
and
yet
there
need
only
be
a
discussion
and
she
has
no
words
of
her
own
but
only
repeats
his
sayings

.

.

.
added
nicholas
yielding
to
that
irresistible
inclination
which
tempts
us
to
judge
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
us
.
he
forgot
that
what
he
was
saying
about
natdsha
could
have
been
applied
word
for
word
to
himself
in
relation
to
his
wife
.
yes
i
have
noticed
that
said
countess
mary
.
when
i
told
him
that
duty
and
the
oath
were
above
everything
he
started
proving
goodness
knows
what
a
pity
you
were
not
first
epilogue
671
there
what
would
you
have
said
as
i
see
it
you
were
quite
right
and
i
told
natasha
so
.
pierre
says
everybody
is
suffering
tortured
and
being
corrupted
and
that
it
is
our
duty
to
help
our
neighbor
.
of
course
he
is
right
there
said
countess
mary
but
he
for
gets
that
we
have
other
duties
nearer
to
us
duties
indicated
to
us
by
god
himself
and
that
though
we
might
expose
ourselves
to
risks
we
must
not
risk
our
children
.
yes
thats
itl
thats
just
what
i
said
to
him
put
in
nicholas
who
fancied
he
really
had
said
it
.
but
they
insisted
on
their
own
view
love
of
ones
neighbor
and
christianity
and
all
this
in
the
presence
of
young
nich
olas
who
had
gone
into
my
study
and
broke
all
my
things
.
ah
nicholas
do
you
know
i
am
often
troubled
about
little
nicholas
said
countess
mary
.
he
is
such
an
exceptional
boy
.
i
am
afraid
i
neglect
him
in
favor
of
my
own
we
all
have
children
and
relations
while
he
has
no
one
.
he
is
constantly
alone
with
his
thoughts
.
well
i
dont
think
you
need
reproach
yourself
on
his
account
.
all
that
the
fondest
mother
could
do
for
her
son
you
have
done
and
are
doing
for
him
and
of
course
i
am
glad
of
it
.
he
is
a
fine
lad
a
fine
ladl
this
evening
he
listened
to
pierre
in
a
sort
of
trance
and
fancy
as
we
were
going
in
to
supper
i
looked
and
he
had
broken
everything
on
my
table
to
bits
and
he
told
me
of
it
himself
at
once
i
never
knew
him
to
tell
an
untruth
.
a
fine
lad
a
fine
ladl
repeated
nicholas
who
at
heart
was
not
fond
of
nicholas
bolk6nski
but
was
always
anxious
to
recognize
that
he
was
a
fine
lad
.
still
i
am
not
the
same
as
his
own
mother
said
countess
mary
.
i
feel
i
am
not
the
same
and
it
troubles
me
.
a
wonderful
boy
but
i
am
dreadfully
afraid
for
him
.
it
would
be
good
for
him
to
have
companions
.
well
it
wont
be
for
long
.
next
summer
ill
take
him
to
petersburg
said
nicholas
.
yes
pierre
always
was
a
dreamer
and
always
will
be
he
continued
returning
to
the
talk
in
the
study
which
had
evidently
disturbed
him
.
well
what
business
is
it
of
mine
what
goes
on
therewhether
arakcheev
is
bad
and
all
that
what
business
was
it
of
mine
when
i
married
and
was
so
deep
in
debt
that
i
was
threatened
with
prison
and
had
a
mother
who
could
not
see
or
understand
it
and
then
there
are
you
and
the
children
and
our
affairs
.
is
it
for
my
own
pleasure
that
i
am
at
the
farm
or
in
the
office
from
morning
to
night
no
but
i
know
i
must
work
to
comfort
my
mother
to
repay
you
and
not
to
leave
the
children
such
beggars
as
i
was
.
countess
mary
wanted
to
tell
him
that
man
does
not
live
by
bread
alone
and
that
he
at
tached
too
much
importance
to
these
matters
.
but
she
knew
she
must
not
say
this
and
that
it
would
be
useless
to
do
so
.
she
only
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
.
he
took
this
as
a
sign
of
ap
proval
and
a
confirmation
of
his
thoughts
and
after
a
few
minutes
reflection
continued
to
think
aloud
.
you
know
mary
today
elias
mitrofinych
this
was
his
overseer
came
back
from
the
tamb6v
estate
and
told
me
they
are
already
offering
eighty
thousand
rubles
for
the
forest
.
and
with
an
eager
face
nicholas
began
to
speak
of
the
possibility
of
repurchasing
otrad
noe
before
long
and
added
another
ten
years
of
life
and
i
shall
leave
the
children

.

.

.
in
an
excellent
position
.
countess
mary
listened
to
her
husband
and
understood
all
that
he
told
her
.
she
knew
that
when
he
thought
aloud
in
this
way
he
would
sometimes
ask
her
what
he
had
been
saying
and
be
vexed
if
he
noticed
that
she
had
been
thinking
about
something
else
.
but
she
had
to
force
herself
to
attend
for
what
he
was
saying
did
not
interest
her
at
all
.
she
looked
at
him
and
did
not
think
but
felt
about
something
different
.
she
felt
a
submissive
tender
love
for
this
man
who
would
never
understand
all
that
she
understood
and
this
seemed
to
make
her
love
for
him
still
stronger
and
added
a
touch
of
passionate
tenderness
.
besides
this
feeling
which
absorbed
her
altogether
and
hindered
her
from
following
the
details
of
her
husbands
plans
thoughts
that
had
no
connection
with
what
he
was
saying
flitted
through
her
mind
.
she
thought
of
her
nephew
.
her
husbands
ac
count
of
the
boys
agitation
while
pierre
was
speaking
struck
her
forcibly
and
various
traits
of
his
gentle
sensitive
character
recurred
to
her
mind
and
while
thinking
of
her
nephew
she
thought
also
of
her
own
children
.
she
did
not
compare
them
with
him
but
compared
her
feeling
for
them
with
her
feeling
for
him
and
felt
with
regret
that
there
was
something
lacking
in
her
feeling
for
young
nicholas
.
sometimes
it
seemed
to
her
that
this
differ
ence
arose
from
the
difference
in
their
ages
but
she
felt
herself
to
blame
toward
him
and
promised
in
her
heart
to
do
better
and
to
ac
complish
the
impossible
in
this
life
to
love
her
husband
her
children
little
nicholas
and
all
her
neighbors
as
christ
loved
mankind
.
67
countess
marys
soul
always
strove
toward
the
infinite
the
eternal
and
the
absolute
and
could
therefore
never
be
at
peace
.
a
stern
ex
pression
of
the
lofty
secret
suffering
of
a
soul
burdened
by
the
body
appeared
on
her
face
.
nicholas
gazed
a
her
.
o
god
what
will
be
come
of
us
if
she
dies
as
i
always
fear
when
her
face
is
like
that
thought
he
and
placing
himself
before
the
icon
he
began
to
say
his
evening
prayers
.
chapter
xvi
natasha
and
pierre
left
alone
also
began
to
talk
as
only
a
husband
and
wife
can
talk
that
is
with
extraordinary
clearness
and
rapidity
understanding
and
expressing
each
others
thoughts
in
ways
contrary
to
all
rules
of
logic
without
premises
deductions
or
conclusions
and
in
a
quite
peculiar
way
.
natasha
was
so
used
to
this
kind
of
talk
with
her
husband
that
for
her
it
was
the
surest
sign
of
something
be
ing
wrong
between
them
if
pierre
followed
a
line
of
logical
reasoning
.
when
he
began
prov
ing
anything
or
talking
argumentatively
and
calmly
and
she
led
on
by
his
example
began
to
do
the
same
she
knew
that
they
were
on
the
verge
of
a
quarrel
.
from
the
moment
they
were
alone
and
na
tdsha
came
up
to
him
with
wideopen
happy
eyes
and
quickly
seizing
his
head
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
saying
now
you
are
all
mine
mine
you
wont
escape
from
that
moment
this
conversation
began
contrary
to
all
the
laws
of
logic
and
contrary
to
them
because
quite
different
subjects
were
talked
about
at
one
and
the
same
time
.
this
simultaneous
dis
cussion
of
many
topics
did
not
prevent
a
clear
understanding
but
on
the
contrary
was
the
surest
sign
that
they
fully
understood
one
an
other
.
just
as
in
a
dream
when
all
is
uncertain
un
reasoning
and
contradictory
except
the
feel
ing
that
guides
the
dream
so
in
this
inter
course
contrary
to
all
laws
of
reason
the
words
themselves
were
not
consecutive
and
clear
but
only
the
feeling
that
prompted
them
.
natasha
spoke
to
pierre
about
her
brothers
life
and
doings
of
how
she
had
suffered
and
lacked
life
during
his
own
absence
and
of
how
she
was
fonder
than
ever
of
mary
and
how
mary
was
in
every
way
better
than
herself
.
in
saying
this
natdsha
was
sincere
in
acknowl
edging
marys
superiority
but
at
the
same
time
by
saying
it
she
made
a
demand
on
pierre
that
he
should
all
the
same
prefer
her
to
mary
and
to
all
other
women
and
that
now
especially
war
and
peace
after
having
seen
many
women
in
petersburg
he
should
tell
her
so
afresh
.
pierre
answering
natashas
words
told
her
how
intolerable
it
had
been
for
him
to
meet
ladies
at
dinners
and
balls
in
petersburg
.
i
have
quite
lost
the
knack
of
talking
to
ladies
he
said
.
it
was
simply
dull
.
besides
i
was
very
busy
.
natdsha
looked
intently
at
him
and
went
on
mary
is
so
splendid
she
said
.
how
she
understands
children
it
is
as
if
she
saw
straight
into
their
souls
.
yesterday
for
instance
mitya
was
naughty

..
.
how
like
his
father
he
is
pierre
inter
jected
.
natasha
knew
why
he
mentioned
mityas
likeness
to
nicholas
the
recollection
of
his
dis
pute
with
his
brotherinlaw
was
unpleasant
and
he
wanted
to
know
what
natdsha
thought
of
it
.
nicholas
has
the
weakness
of
never
agree
ing
with
anything
not
generally
accepted
.
but
i
understand
that
you
value
what
opens
up
a
fresh
line
said
she
repeating
words
pierre
had
once
uttered
.
no
the
chief
point
is
that
to
nicholas
ideas
and
discussions
are
an
amusemental
most
a
pastime
said
pierre
.
for
instance
he
is
collecting
a
library
and
has
made
it
a
rule
not
to
buy
a
new
book
till
he
has
read
what
he
had
already
bought
sismondi
and
rousseau
and
montesquieu
he
added
with
a
smile
.
you
know
how
much
i

..
.
he
began
to
soften
down
what
he
had
said
but
natdsha
inter
rupted
him
to
show
that
this
was
unnecessary
.
so
you
say
ideas
are
an
amusement
to
him
.

.

.

.
yes
and
for
me
nothing
else
is
serious
.
ah
the
time
in
petersburg
i
saw
everyone
as
in
a
dream
.
when
i
am
taken
up
by
a
thought
all
else
is
mere
amusement
.
ah
im
so
sorry
i
wasnt
there
when
you
met
the
children
said
natdsha
.
which
was
most
delighted
lisa
im
sure
.
yes
pierre
replied
and
went
on
with
what
was
in
his
mind
.
nicholas
says
we
ought
not
to
think
.
but
i
cant
help
it
.
besides
when
i
was
in
petersburg
i
felt
i
can
say
this
to
you
that
the
whole
affair
would
go
to
pieces
with
out
meeveryone
was
pulling
his
own
way
.
but
i
succeeded
in
uniting
them
all
and
then
my
idea
is
so
clear
and
simple
.
you
see
i
dont
say
that
we
ought
to
oppose
this
and
that
.
we
may
be
mistaken
.
what
i
say
is
join
hands
you
who
love
the
right
and
let
there
be
but
first
epilogue

one

that
of
active
virtue
prince
ser
gy
is
a
fine
fellow
and
clever
.
natasha
would
have
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
greatness
of
pierres
idea
but
one
thing
dis
concerted
her
.
can
a
man
so
important
and
necessary
to
society
be
also
my
husband
how
did
this
happen
she
wished
to
express
this
doubt
to
him
.
now
who
could
decide
whether
he
is
really
cleverer
than
all
the
others
she
asked
herself
and
passed
in
review
all
those
whom
pierre
most
respected
.
judging
by
what
he
had
said
there
was
no
one
he
had
respected
so
highly
as
plat6n
karataev
.
do
you
know
what
i
am
thinking
about
she
asked
.
about
plat6n
karataev
.
would
he
have
approved
of
you
now
do
you
think
pierre
was
not
at
all
surprised
at
this
ques
tion
.
he
understood
his
wifes
line
of
thought
.
plat6n
karatdev
he
repeated
and
pon
dered
evidently
sincerely
trying
to
imagine
karatievs
opinion
on
the
subject
.
he
would
not
have
understood

.

.

.yet
perhaps
he
would
.
i
love
you
awfully
natdsha
suddenly
said
.
awfully
awfully
no
he
would
not
have
approved
said
pierre
after
reflection
.
what
he
would
have
approved
of
is
our
family
life
.
he
was
always
so
anxious
to
find
seemliness
happiness
and
peace
in
everything
and
i
should
have
been
proud
to
let
him
see
us
.
there
nowyou
talk
of
my
absence
but
you
wouldnt
believe
what
a
special
feeling
i
have
for
you
after
a
separa
tion
.

.

.

.
yes
i
should
think

.

.

.
natasha
began
.
no
its
not
that
.
i
never
leave
off
loving
you
.
and
one
couldnt
love
more
but
this
is
something
special
.

.

.

.
yes
of
course
he
did
not
finish
because
their
eyes
meeting
said
the
rest
.
what
nonsense
it
is
natdsha
suddenly
ex
claimed
about
honeymoons
and
that
the
greatest
happiness
is
at
first
on
the
contrary
now
is
the
best
of
all
.
if
only
you
did
not
go
away
do
you
remember
how
we
quarreled
and
it
was
always
my
fault
.
always
mine
.
and
what
we
quarreled
about
i
dont
even
remem
ber
always
about
the
same
thing
said
pierre
with
a
smile
.
jealo

.

.

.
dont
say
it
i
cant
bear
it
natdsha
cried
and
her
eyes
glittered
coldly
and
vindictively
.
did
you
see
her
she
added
after
a
pause
.
no
and
if
i
had
i
shouldnt
have
recog
nized
her
.
they
were
silent
for
a
while
.
oh
do
you
know
while
you
were
talking
in
the
study
i
was
looking
at
you
natdsha
began
evidently
anxious
to
disperse
the
cloud
that
had
come
over
them
.
you
are
as
like
him
as
two
peas
like
the
boy
.
she
meant
her
lit
tle
son
.
oh
its
time
to
go
to
him
.

.

.

.
the
milks
come
.

.

.

.
but
im
sorry
to
leave
you
.
they
were
silent
for
a
few
seconds
.
then
suddenly
turning
to
one
another
at
the
same
time
they
both
began
to
speak
.
pierre
began
with
selfsatisfaction
and
enthusiasm
natasha
with
a
quiet
happy
smile
.
having
interrupted
one
another
they
both
stopped
to
let
the
other
continue
.
no
.
what
did
you
say
go
on
go
on
.
no
you
go
on
i
was
talking
nonsense
said
natasha
.
pierre
finished
what
he
had
begun
.
it
was
the
sequel
to
his
complacent
reflections
on
his
success
in
petersburg
.
at
that
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
chosen
to
give
a
new
direc
tion
to
the
whole
of
russian
society
and
to
the
whole
world
.
i
only
wished
to
say
that
ideas
that
have
great
results
are
always
simple
ones
.
my
whole
idea
is
that
if
vicious
people
are
united
and
constitute
a
power
then
honest
folk
must
do
the
same
.
now
thats
simple
enough
.
yes
.
and
what
were
you
going
to
say
i
only
nonsense
.
but
all
the
same
oh
nothing
only
a
trifle
said
natdsha
smiling
still
more
brightly
.
i
only
wanted
to
tell
you
about
ptya
today
nurse
was
coming
to
take
him
from
me
and
he
laughed
shut
his
eyes
and
clung
to
me
.
im
sure
he
thought
he
was
hiding
.
awfully
sweet
there
now
hes
crying
.
well
goodby
and
she
left
the
room
.
meanwhile
downstairs
in
young
nicholas
bolk6nskis
bedroom
a
little
lamp
was
burn
ing
as
usual
.
the
boy
was
afraid
of
the
dark
and
they
could
not
cure
him
of
it
.
dessalles
slept
propped
up
on
four
pillows
and
his
roman
nose
emitted
sounds
of
rhythmic
snor
ing
.
little
nicholas
who
had
just
waked
up
in
a
cold
perspiration
sat
up
in
bed
and
gazed
be
fore
him
with
wideopen
eyes
.
he
had
awaked
from
a
terrible
dream
.
he
had
dreamed
that
he
and
uncle
pierre
wearing
helmets
such
as
were
depicted
in
his
plutarch
were
leading
a
huge
army
.
the
army
was
made
up
of
white
slanting
lines
that
filled
the
air
like
the
cob
webs
that
float
about
in
autumn
and
which
dessalles
called
ics
fils
dc
la
vitrgc
.
in
front
was
glory
which
was
similar
to
those
threads
674
war
and
peace
but
rather
thicker
.
he
and
pierre
were
borne
along
lightly
and
joyously
nearer
and
nearer
to
their
goal
.
suddenly
the
threads
that
moved
them
began
to
slacken
and
become
entangled
and
it
grew
difficult
to
move
.
and
uncle
nich
olas
stood
before
them
in
a
stern
and
threaten
ing
attitude
.
have
you
done
this
he
said
pointing
to
some
broken
sealing
wax
and
pens
.
i
loved
you
but
i
have
orders
from
arakcheev
and
will
kill
the
first
of
you
who
moves
forward
.
little
nicholas
turned
to
look
at
pierre
but
pierre
was
no
longer
there
.
in
his
place
was
his
father
prince
andrew
and
his
father
had
neither
shape
nor
form
but
he
existed
and
when
little
nicholas
perceived
him
he
grew
faint
with
love
he
felt
himself
powerless
limp
and
formless
.
his
father
caressed
and
pitied
him
.
but
uncle
nicholas
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
them
.
terror
seized
young
nicholas
and
he
awoke
.
my
father
he
thought
.
though
there
were
two
good
portraits
of
prince
andrew
in
the
house
nicholas
never
imagined
him
in
hu
man
form
.
my
father
has
been
with
me
and
caressed
me
.
he
approved
of
me
and
of
uncle
pierre
.
whatever
he
may
tell
me
i
will
do
it
.
mucius
scaevola
burned
his
hand
.
why
should
not
the
same
sort
of
thing
happen
to
me
i
know
they
want
me
to
learn
.
and
i
will
learn
but
someday
i
shall
have
finished
learning
and
then
i
will
do
something
.
i
only
pray
god
that
something
may
happen
to
me
such
as
hap
pened
to
plutarchs
men
and
i
will
act
as
they
did
.
i
will
do
better
.
everyone
shall
know
me
love
me
and
be
delighted
with
me
and
sud
denly
his
bosom
heaved
with
sobs
and
he
be
gan
to
cry
.
are
you
ill
he
heard
dessalles
voice
ask
ing
.
no
answered
nicholas
and
lay
back
on
his
pillow
.
he
is
good
and
kind
and
i
am
fond
of
him
he
thought
of
dessalles
.
but
uncle
pierre
oh
what
a
wonderful
man
he
is
and
my
father
oh
father
father
yes
1
will
do
something
with
which
even
he
would
be
satis
fied

second
epilogue
chapter
i
history
is
the
life
of
nations
and
of
humanity
.
to
seize
and
put
into
words
to
describe
di
rectly
the
life
of
humanity
or
even
of
a
single
nation
appears
impossible
.
the
ancient
historians
all
employed
one
and
the
same
method
to
describe
and
seize
the
apparently
elusivethe
life
of
a
people
.
they
described
the
activity
of
individuals
who
ruled
the
people
and
regarded
the
activity
of
those
men
as
representing
the
activity
of
the
whole
nation
.
the
question
how
did
individuals
make
na
tions
act
as
they
wished
and
by
what
was
the
will
of
these
individuals
themselves
guided
the
ancients
met
by
recognizing
a
divinity
which
subjected
the
nations
to
the
will
of
a
chosen
man
and
guided
the
will
of
that
chosen
man
so
as
to
accomplish
ends
that
were
predestined
.
for
the
ancients
these
questions
were
solved
by
a
belief
in
the
direct
participation
of
the
deity
in
human
affairs
.
modern
history
in
theory
rejects
both
these
principles
.
it
would
seem
that
having
rejected
the
be
lief
of
the
ancients
in
mans
subjection
to
the
deity
and
in
a
predetermined
aim
toward
which
nations
are
led
modern
history
should
study
not
the
manifestations
of
power
but
the
causes
that
produce
it
.
but
modern
history
has
not
done
this
.
having
in
theory
rejected
the
view
held
by
the
ancients
it
still
follows
them
in
practice
.
instead
of
men
endowed
with
divine
author
ity
and
directly
guided
by
the
will
of
god
modern
history
has
given
us
either
heroes
en
dowed
with
extraordinary
superhuman
capac
ities
or
simply
men
of
very
various
kinds
from
monarchs
to
journalists
who
lead
the
masses
.
instead
of
the
former
divinely
appointed
aims
of
the
jewish
greek
or
roman
nations
which
ancient
historians
regarded
as
representing
the
progress
of
humanity
modern
history
has
postulated
its
own
aims
the
welfare
of
the
french
german
or
english
people
or
in
its
highest
abstraction
the
welfare
and
civiliza
tion
of
humanity
in
general
by
which
is
usu
ally
meant
that
of
the
peoples
occupying
a
small
northwesterly
portion
of
a
large
con
tinent
.
modern
history
has
rejected
the
beliefs
of
the
ancients
without
replacing
them
by
a
new
conception
and
the
logic
of
the
situation
has
obliged
the
historians
after
they
had
appar
ently
rejected
the
divine
authority
of
the
kings
and
the
fate
of
the
ancients
to
reach
the
same
conclusion
by
another
road
that
is
to
recognize
i
nations
guided
by
individual
men
and
2
the
existence
of
a
known
aim
to
which
these
nations
and
humanity
at
large
are
tending
.
at
the
basis
of
the
works
of
all
the
modern
historians
from
gibbon
to
buckle
despite
their
seeming
disagreements
and
the
appar
ent
novelty
of
their
outlooks
lie
those
two
old
unavoidable
assumptions
.
in
the
first
place
the
historian
describes
the
activity
of
individuals
who
in
his
opinion
have
directed
humanity
one
historian
considers
only
monarchs
generals
and
ministers
as
be
ing
such
men
while
another
includes
also
orators
learned
men
reformers
philosophers
and
poets
.
secondly
it
is
assumed
that
the
goal
toward
which
humanity
is
being
led
is
known
to
the
historians
to
one
of
them
this
goal
is
the
greatness
of
the
roman
spanish
or
french
realm
to
another
it
is
liberty
equal
ity
and
a
certain
kind
of
civilization
of
a
small
corner
of
the
world
called
europe
.
in
1789
a
ferment
arises
in
paris
it
grows
spreads
and
is
expressed
by
a
movement
of
peoples
from
west
to
east
.
several
times
it
moves
eastward
and
collides
with
a
counter
movement
from
the
east
westward
.
in
18
is
it
reaches
its
extreme
limit
moscow
and
then
with
remarkable
symmetry
a
countermove
ment
occurs
from
east
to
west
attracting
to
it
as
the
first
movement
had
done
the
nations
of
middle
europe
.
the
countermovement
reaches
the
starting
point
of
the
first
movement
in
the
675
676
west
paris
and
subsides
.
during
that
twentyyear
period
an
immense
number
of
fields
were
left
untilled
houses
were
burned
trade
changed
its
direction
mil
lions
of
men
migrated
were
impoverished
or
were
enriched
and
millions
of
christian
men
professing
the
law
of
love
of
their
fellows
slew
one
another
.
what
does
all
this
mean
why
did
it
hap
pen
what
made
those
people
burn
houses
and
slay
their
fellow
men
what
were
the
causes
of
these
events
what
force
made
men
act
so
these
are
the
instinctive
plain
and
most
legitimate
questions
humanity
asks
it
self
when
it
encounters
the
monuments
and
tradition
of
that
period
.
for
a
reply
to
these
questions
the
common
sense
of
mankind
turns
to
the
science
of
his
tory
whose
aim
is
to
enable
nations
and
hu
manity
to
know
themselves
.
if
history
had
retained
the
conception
of
the
ancients
it
would
have
said
that
god
to
reward
or
punish
his
people
gave
napoleon
power
and
directed
his
will
to
the
fulfillment
of
the
divine
ends
and
that
reply
would
have
been
clear
and
complete
.
one
might
believe
or
disbelieve
in
the
divine
significance
of
na
poleon
but
for
anyone
believing
in
it
there
would
have
been
nothing
unintelligible
in
the
history
of
that
period
nor
would
there
have
been
any
contradictions
.
but
modern
history
cannot
give
that
reply
.
science
does
not
admit
the
conception
of
the
ancients
as
to
the
direct
participation
of
the
deity
in
human
affairs
and
therefore
history
ought
to
give
other
answers
.
modern
history
replying
to
these
questions
says
you
want
to
know
what
this
movement
means
what
caused
it
and
what
force
pro
duced
these
events
then
listen
louis
xiv
was
a
very
proud
and
self
confident
man
he
had
such
and
such
mistresses
and
such
and
such
ministers
and
he
ruled
france
badly
.
his
descendants
were
weak
men
and
they
too
ruled
france
badly
.
and
they
had
such
and
such
favorites
and
such
and
such
mistresses
.
moreover
certain
men
wrote
some
books
at
that
time
.
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
there
were
a
couple
of
dozen
men
in
paris
who
began
to
talk
about
all
men
being
free
and
equal
.
this
caused
people
all
over
france
to
begin
to
slash
at
and
drown
one
another
.
they
killed
the
king
and
many
other
people
.
at
that
time
there
was
in
france
a
man
of
genius
napoleon
.
he
con
quered
everybody
everywhere
that
is
he
war
and
peace
killed
many
people
because
he
was
a
great
genius
.
and
for
some
reason
he
went
to
kill
africans
and
killed
them
so
well
and
was
so
cunning
and
wise
that
when
he
returned
to
france
he
ordered
everybody
to
obey
him
and
they
all
obeyed
him
.
having
become
an
em
peror
he
again
went
out
to
kill
people
in
italy
austria
and
prussia
.
and
there
too
he
killed
a
great
many
.
in
russia
there
was
an
emperor
alexander
who
decided
to
restore
order
in
europe
and
therefore
fought
against
napoleon
.
in
1807
he
suddenly
made
friends
with
him
but
in
1811
they
again
quarreled
and
again
began
killing
many
people
.
napoleon
led
six
hundred
thousand
men
into
russia
and
cap
tured
moscow
then
he
suddenly
ran
away
from
moscow
and
the
emperor
alexander
helped
by
the
advice
of
stein
and
others
united
europe
to
arm
against
the
disturber
of
its
peace
.
all
napoleons
allies
suddenly
became
his
enemies
and
their
forces
advanced
against
the
fresh
forces
he
raised
.
the
allies
defeated
napoleon
entered
paris
forced
na
poleon
to
abdicate
and
sent
him
to
the
island
of
elba
not
depriving
him
of
the
title
of
em
peror
and
showing
him
every
respect
though
five
years
before
and
one
year
later
they
all
regarded
him
as
an
outlaw
and
a
brigand
.
then
louis
xviii
who
till
then
had
been
the
laughingstock
both
of
the
french
and
the
allies
began
to
reign
.
and
napoleon
shed
ding
tears
before
his
old
guards
renounced
the
throne
and
went
into
exile
.
then
the
skill
ful
statesmen
and
diplomatists
especially
talleyrand
who
managed
to
sit
down
in
a
particular
chair
before
anyone
else
and
there
by
extended
the
frontiers
of
france
talked
in
vienna
and
by
these
conversations
made
the
nations
happy
or
unhappy
.
suddenly
the
diplomatists
and
monarchs
nearly
quarreled
and
were
on
the
point
of
again
ordering
their
armies
to
kill
one
another
but
just
then
na
poleon
arrived
in
france
with
a
battalion
and
the
french
who
had
been
hating
him
immedi
ately
all
submitted
to
him
.
but
the
allied
monarchs
were
angry
at
this
and
went
to
fight
the
french
once
more
.
and
they
defeated
the

it
would
be
a

to
think
that
this

second

ironic
a
caricature
of
the
historical
accounts

on
the

it
is
a
very
mild
expression
of
the
contradictory

not
meeting
the
questions
which
all
the

give

the

of

to
the
writers
of

and
the

of

the
strangeness
and
absurdity
of

arise
from
the
fact
that
modern

like
a

answers
questions
no

has

the

the

that

that

all
that
may
be
so
and
mankind
is
ready
to
agree
with
it
but
it
is
not
what
was
asked
.
all
that
would
be
interesting
if
we
recognized
a
divine
power
based
on
itself
and
always
con
sistently
directing
its
nations
through
napo
leons
louises
and
writers
but
we
do
not
acknowledge
such
a
power
and
therefore
be
fore
speaking
about
napoleons
louises
and
authors
we
ought
to
be
shown
the
connection
existing
between
these
men
and
the
movement
of
the
nations
.
if
instead
of
a
divine
power
some
other
force
has
appeared
it
should
be
explained
in
what
this
new
force
consists
for
the
whole
in
terest
of
history
lies
precisely
in
that
force
.
history
seems
to
assume
that
this
force
is
selfevident
and
known
to
everyone
.
but
in
spite
of
every
desire
to
regard
it
as
known
anyone
reading
many
historical
works
cannot
help
doubting
whether
this
new
force
so
vari
ously
understood
by
the
historians
themselves
is
really
quite
well
known
to
everybody
.
677
chapter
ii
what
force
moves
the
nations
biographical
historians
and
historians
of
separate
nations
understand
this
force
as
a
power
inherent
in
heroes
and
rulers
.
in
their
narration
events
occur
solely
by
the
will
of
a
napoleon
and
alexander
or
in
general
of
the
persons
they
describe
.
the
answers
given
by
this
kind
of
historian
to
the
question
of
what
force
causes
events
to
happen
are
satis
factory
only
as
long
as
there
is
but
one
his
torian
to
each
event
.
as
soon
as
historians
of
different
nationalities
and
tendencies
begin
to
describe
the
same
event
the
replies
they
give
immediately
lose
all
meaning
for
this
force
is
understood
by
them
all
not
only
differently
but
often
in
quite
contradictory
ways
.
one
historian
says
that
an
event
was
produced
by
napoleons
power
another
that
it
was
pro
duced
by
alexanders
a
third
that
it
was
due
to
the
power
of
some
other
person
.
besides
this
historians
of
that
kind
contradict
each
other
even
in
their
statement
as
to
the
force
on
which
the
authority
of
some
particular
per
son
was
based
.
thiers
a
bonapartist
says
that
napoleons
power
was
based
on
his
virtue
and
genius
.
lanfrey
a
republican
says
it
was
based
on
his
trickery
and
deception
of
the
people
.
so
the
historians
of
this
class
by
mutu
ally
destroying
one
anothers
positions
destroy
the
understanding
of
the
force
which
produces
events
and
furnish
no
reply
to
historys
essen
tial
question
.
writers
of
universal
history
who
deal
with
all
the
nations
seem
to
recognize
how
erro
neous
is
the
specialist
historians
view
of
the
force
which
produces
events
.
they
do
not
recognize
it
as
a
power
inherent
in
heroes
and
rulers
but
as
the
resultant
of
a
multiplicity
of
variously
directed
forces
.
in
describing
a
war
or
the
subjugation
of
a
people
a
general
his
torian
looks
for
the
cause
of
the
event
not
in
the
power
of
one
man
but
in
the
interaction
of
many
persons
connected
with
the
event
.
according
to
this
view
the
power
of
histori
cal
personages
represented
as
the
product
of
many
forces
can
no
longer
it
would
seem
be
regarded
as
a
force
that
itself
produces
events
.
yet
in
most
cases
universal
historians
still
em
ploy
the
conception
of
power
as
a
force
that
itself
produces
events
and
treat
it
as
their
cause
.
in
their
exposition
an
historic
char
acter
is
first
the
product
of
his
time
and
his
power
only
the
resultant
of
various
forces
and
then
his
power
is
itself
a
force
producing
events
.
gervinus
schlosser
and
others
for
in
stance
at
one
time
prove
napoleon
to
be
a
product
of
the
revolution
of
the
ideas
of
1789
and
so
forth
and
at
another
plainly
say
that
the
campaign
of
1812
and
other
things
they
do
not
like
were
simply
the
product
of
napoleons
misdirected
will
and
that
the
very
ideas
of
1789
were
arrested
in
their
develop
ment
by
napoleons
capricej
the
ideas
of
the
revolution
and
the
general
temper
of
the
age

but
napoleons
power
suppressed

ideas
of
the

and
the
general

of

war
and
peace
this
curious
contradiction
is
not
accidental
.
not
only
does
it
occur
at
every
step
but
the
universal
historians
accounts
are
all
made
up
of
a
chain
of
such
contradictions
.
this
contra
diction
occurs
because
after
entering
the
field
of
analysis
the
universal
historians
stop
half
way
.
to
find
component
forces
equal
to
the
com
posite
or
resultant
force
the
sum
of
the
com
ponents
must
equal
the
resultant
.
this
condi
tion
is
never
observed
by
the
universal
his
torians
and
so
to
explain
the
resultant
forces
they
are
obliged
to
admit
in
addition
to
the
insufficient
components
another
unexplained
force
affecting
the
resultant
action
.
specialist
historians
describing
the
cam
paign
of
1813
or
the
restoration
of
the
bour
bons
plainly
assert
that
these
events
were
pro
duced
by
the
will
of
alexander
.
but
the
uni
versal
historian
gervinus
refuting
this
opinion
of
the
specialist
historian
tries
to
prove
that
the
campaign
of
1813
and
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
were
due
to
other
things
beside
alexanders
willsuch
as
the
activity
of
stein
metternich
madame
de
stael
talleyrand
fichte
chateaubriand
and
others
.
the
his
torian
evidently
decomposes
alexanders
pow
er
into
the
components
talleyrand
chateau
briand
and
the
rest
but
the
sum
of
the
com
ponents
that
is
the
interactions
of
chateau
briand
talleyrand
madame
de
stael
and
the
others
evidently
does
not
equal
the
result
ant
namely
the
phenomenon
of
millions
of
frenchmen
submitting
to
the
bourbons
.
that
chateaubriand
madame
de
stael
and
others
spoke
certain
words
to
one
another
only
affect
ed
their
mutual
relations
but
does
not
account
for
the
submission
of
millions
.
and
therefore
to
explain
how
from
these
relations
of
theirs
the
submission
of
millions
of
people
resulted
that
is
how
component
forces
equal

a
the
historian
is
again
obliged
to
fall
back
on
power
the
force
he
had
denied
and
to
rec
ognize
it
as
the
resultant
of
the
forces
that
is
he
has
to
admit
an
unexplained
force
acting
on
the
resultant
.
and
that
is
just
what
the
universal
historians
do
and
consequently
they
not
only
contradict
the
specialist
historians
but
contradict
themselves
.

in

way
the
universal

sometimes
when
it
pleases
them
and
fits
in
with
their
theory
say
that
power
is
the
result
of

and
sometimes
when
they
want
to
prove
something
else
say
that

produces

.
a
third
class
of
historians
the
socalled
his
torians
of
culturefollowing
the
path
laid
down
by
the
universal
historians
who
some
times
accept
writers
and
ladies
as
forces
pro
ducing
events
again
take
that
force
to
be
something
quite
different
.
they
see
it
in
what
is
called
culture
in
mental
activity
.
the
historians
of
culture
are
quite
consist
ent
in
regard
to
their
progenitors
the
writers
of
universal
histories
for
if
historical
events
may
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
certain
per
sons
treated
one
another
in
such
and
such
ways
why
not
explain
them
by
the
fact
that
such
and
such
people
wrote
such
and
such
books
of
the
immense
number
of
indications
accompanying
every
vital
phenomenon
these
historians
select
the
indication
of
intellectual
activity
and
say
that
this
indication
is
the
cause
.
but
despite
their
endeavors
to
prove
that
the
cause
of
events
lies
in
intellectual
activity
only
by
a
great
stretch
can
one
admit
that
there
is
any
connection
between
intellectual
activity
and
the
movement
of
peoples
and
in
no
case
can
one
admit
that
intellectual
activ
ity
controls
peoples
actions
for
that
view
is
not
confirmed
by
such
facts
as
the
very
cruel
murders
of
the
french
revolution
resulting
from
the
doctrine
of
the
equality
of
man
or
the
very
cruel
wars
and
executions
resulting
from
the
preaching
of
love
.
but
even
admitting
as
correct
all
the
cun
ningly
devised
arguments
with
which
these
histories
are
filled
admitting
that
nations
are
governed
by
some
undefined
force
called
an
idea
historys
essential
question
still
re
mains
unanswered
and
to
the
former
power
of
monarchs
and
to
the
influence
of
advisers
and
other
people
introduced
by
the
universal
his
torians
another
newer
force
the
idea
is
added
the
connection
of
which
with
the
masses
needs
explanation
.
it
is
possible
to
understand
that
napoleon
had
power
and
so
events
oc
curred
with
some
effort
one
may
even
con
ceive
that
napoleon
together
with
other
in
fluences
was
the
cause
of
an
event
but
how
a
book
le
contrat
social
had
the
effect
of
mak
ing
frenchmen
begin
to
drown
one
another
cannot
be
understood
without
an
explana
tion
of
the
causal
nexus
of
this
new
force
with
the
event
.
undoubtedly
some
relation
exists
between
all
who
live
contemporaneously
and
so
it
is
second
epilogue
possible
to
find
some
connection
between
the
intellectual
activity
of
men
and
their
histori
cal
movements
just
as
such
a
connection
may
be
found
between
the
movements
of
human
ity
and
commerce
handicraft
gardening
or
anything
else
you
please
.
but
why
intellectual
activity
is
considered
by
the
historians
of
cul
ture
to
be
the
cause
or
expression
of
the
whole
historical
movement
is
hard
to
understand
.
only
the
following
considerations
can
have
led
the
historians
to
such
a
conclusion
i
that
history
is
written
by
learned
men
and
so
it
is
natural
and
agreeable
for
them
to
think
that
the
activity
of
their
class
supplies
the
basis
of
the
movement
of
all
humanity
just
as
a
similar
belief
is
natural
and
agreeable
to
traders
agriculturists
and
soldiers
if
they
do
not
express
it
that
is
merely
because
traders
and
soldiers
do
not
write
history
and
2
that
spiritual
activity
enlightenment
civilization
culture
ideas
are
all
indistinct
indefinite
con
ceptions
under
whose
banner
it
is
very
easy
to
use
words
having
a
still
less
definite
meaning
and
which
can
therefore
be
readily
introduced
into
any
theory
.
but
not
to
speak
of
the
intrinsic
quality
of
histories
of
this
kind
which
may
possibly
even
be
of
use
to
someone
for
something
the
his
tories
of
culture
to
which
all
general
histories
tend
more
and
more
to
approximate
are
sig
nificant
from
the
fact
that
after
seriously
and
minutely
examining
various
religious
philo
sophic
and
political
doctrines
as
causes
of
events
as
soon
as
they
have
to
describe
an
ac
tual
historic
event
such
as
the
campaign
of
1812
for
instance
they
involuntarily
describe
it
as
resulting
from
an
exercise
of
powerand
say
plainly
that
that
campaign
was
the
result
of
napoleons
will
.
speaking
so
the
historians
of
culture
involuntarily
contradict
themselves
and
show
that
the
new
force
they
have
devised
does
not
account
for
what
happens
in
history
and
that
history
can
only
be
explained
by
in
troducing
a
power
which
they
apparently
do
not
recognize
.
chapter
iii
a
locomotive
is
moving
.
someone
asks
what
moves
it
a
peasant
says
the
devil
moves
it
.
another
man
says
the
locomotive
moves
be
cause
its
wheels
go
round
.
a
third
asserts
that
the
cause
of
its
movement
lies
in
the
smoke
which
the
wind
carries
away
.
the
peasant
is
irrefutable
.
he
has
devised
a
complete
explanation
.
to
refute
him
some
one
would
have
to
prove
to
him
that
there
is
no
devil
or
another
peasant
would
have
to
explain
to
him
that
it
is
not
the
devil
but
a
german
who
moves
the
locomotive
.
only
then
as
a
result
of
the
contradiction
will
they
see
that
they
are
both
wrong
.
but
the
man
who
says
that
the
movement
of
the
wheels
is
the
cause
refutes
himself
for
having
once
begun
to
analyze
he
ought
to
go
on
and
explain
further
why
the
wheels
go
round
and
till
he
has
reached
the
ultimate
cause
of
the
move
ment
of
the
locomotive
in
the
pressure
of
steam
in
the
boiler
he
has
no
right
to
stop
in
his
search
for
the
cause
.
the
man
who
explains
the
movement
of
the
locomotive
by
the
smoke
that
is
carried
back
has
noticed
that
the
wheels
do
not
supply
an
explanation
and
has
taken
the
first
sign
that
occurs
to
him
and
in
his
turn
has
offered
that
as
an
explanation
.
the
only
conception
that
can
explain
the
movement
of
the
locomotive
is
that
of
a
force
commensurate
with
the
movement
observed
.
the
only
conception
that
can
explain
the
movement
of
the
peoples
is
that
of
some
force
commensurate
with
the
whole
movement
of
the
peoples
.
yet
to
supply
this
conception
various
his
torians
take
forces
of
different
kinds
all
of
which
are
incommensurate
with
the
movement
observed
.
some
see
it
as
a
force
directly
inher
ent
in
heroes
as
the
peasant
sees
the
devil
in
the
locomotive
others
as
a
force
resulting
from
several
other
forces
like
the
movement
of
the
wheels
others
again
as
an
intellectual
influence
like
the
smoke
that
is
blown
away
.
so
long
as
histories
are
written
of
separate
individuals
whether
caesars
alexanders
luthers
or
voltaires
and
not
the
histories
of
all
absolutely
all
those
who
take
part
in
an
event
it
is
quite
impossible
to
describe
the
movement
of
humanity
without
the
concep
tion
of
a
force
compelling
men
to
direct
their
activity
toward
a
certain
end
.
and
the
only
such
conception
known
to
historians
is
that
of
power
.
this
conception
is
the
one
handle
by
means
of
which
the
material
of
history
as
at
present
expounded
can
be
dealt
with
and
anyone
who
breaks
that
handle
off
as
buckle
did
without
finding
some
other
method
of
treat
ing
historical
material
merely
deprives
him
self
of
the
one
possible
way
of
dealing
with
it
.
the
necessity
of
the
conception
of
power
as
an
explanation
of
historical
events
is
best
dem
onstrated
by
the
universal
historians
and
his
torians
of
culture
themselves
for
they
pro
fessedly
reject
that
conception
but
inevitably
68o
war
and
peace
have
recourse
to
it
at
every
step
.
in
dealing
with

inquiry
the
science
of

up
to
now
is
like
money
in
circulation
paper
money
and
coin
.
the
bi
ographies
and
special
national
histories
are
like
paper
money
.
they
can
be
used
and
can
circulate
and
fulfill
their
purpose
without
harm
to
anyone
and
even
advantageously
as
long
as
no
one
asks
what
is
the
security
behind
them
.
you
need
only
forget
to
ask
how
the
will
of
heroes
produces
events
and
such
his
tories
as
thiers
will
be
interesting
and
in
structive
and
may
perhaps
even
possess
a
tinge
of
poetry
.
but
just
as
doubts
of
the
real
value
of
paper
money
arise
either
because
being
easy
to
make
too
much
of
it
gets
made
or
be
cause
people
try
to
exchange
it
for
gold
so
also
doubts
concerning
the
real
value
of
such
histories
arise
either
because
too
many
of
them
are
written
or
because
in
his
simplicity
of
heart
someone
inquires
by
what
force
did
napoleon
do
thisthat
is
wants
to
exchange
the
current
paper
money
for
the
real
gold
of
actual
comprehension
.
the
writers
of
universal
histories
and
of
the
history
of
culture
are
like
people
who
recog
nizing
the
defects
of
paper
money
decide
to
substitute
for
it
money
made
of
metal
that
has
not
the
specific
gravity
of
gold
.
it
may
in
deed
make
jingling
coin
but
will
do
no
more
than
that
.
paper
money
may
deceive
the
ignor
ant
but
nobody
is
deceived
by
tokens
of
base
metal
that
have
no
value
but
merely
jingle
.
as
gold
is
gold
only
if
it
is
serviceable
not
merely
for
exchange
but
also
for
use
so
uni
versal
historians
will
be
valuable
only
when
they
can
reply
to
historys
essential
question
what
is
power
the
universal
historians
give
contradictory
replies
to
that
question
while
the
historians
of
culture
evade
it
and
answer
something
quite
different
.
and
as
counters
of
imitation
gold
can
be
used
only
among
a
group
of
people
who
agree
to
accept
them
as
gold
or
among
those
who
do
not
know
the
nature
of
gold
so
universal
historians
and
historians
of
culture
not
answering
human
itys
essential
question
serve
as
currency
for
some
purposes
of
their
own
only
in
univer
sities
and
among
the
mass
of
readers
who
have
a
taste
for
what
they
call
serious
reading
.
chapter
iv
having
abandoned
the
conception
of
the
an
cients
as
to
the
divine
subjection
of
the
will
of
a
nation
to
some
chosen
man
and
the
subjec
tion
of
that
mans
will
to
the
deity
history
cannot
without
contradictions
take
a
single
step
till
it
has
chosen
one
of
two
things
either
a
return
to
the
former
belief
in
the
direct
in
tervention
of
the
deity
in
human
affairs
or
a
definite
explanation
of
the
meaning
of
the
force
producing
historical
events
and
termed
power
.
a
return
to
the
first
is
impossible
the
belief
has
been
destroyed
and
so
it
is
essential
to
explain
what
is
meant
by
power
.
napoleon
ordered
an
army
to
be
raised
and
go
to
war
.
we
are
so
accustomed
to
that
idea
and
have
become
so
used
to
it
that
the
ques
tion
why
did
six
hundred
thousand
men
go
to
fight
when
napoleon
uttered
certain
words
seems
to
us
senseless
.
he
had
the
power
and
so
what
he
ordered
was
done
.
this
reply
is
quite
satisfactory
if
we
believe
that
the
power
was
given
him
by
god
.
but
as
soon
as
we
do
not
admit
that
it
becomes
es
sential
to
determine
what
is
this
power
of
one
man
over
others
.
it
cannot
be
the
direct
physical
power
o
a
strong
man
over
a
weak
one
a
domination
based
on
the
application
or
threat
of
physical
force
like
the
power
of
hercules
nor
can
it
be
based
on
the
effect
of
moral
force
as
in
their
simplicity
some
historians
think
who
say
that
the
leading
figures
in
history
are
heroes
that
is
men
gifted
with
a
special
strength
of
soul
and
mind
called
genius
.
this
power
can
not
be
based
on
the
predominance
of
moral
strength
for
not
to
mention
heroes
such
as
napoleon
about
whose
moral
qualities
opin
ions
differ
widely
history
shows
us
that
neither
a
louis
xi
nor
a
metternich
who
ruled
over
millions
of
people
had
any
particular
moral
qualities
but
on
the
contrary
were
generally
morally
weaker
than
any
of
the
millions
they
ruled
over
.
if
the
source
of
power
lies
neither
in
the
physical
nor
in
the
moral
qualities
of
him
who
possesses
it
it
must
evidently
be
looked
for
elsewhere
in
the
relation
to
the
people
of
the
man
who
wields
the
power
.
and
that
is
how
power
is
understood
by
the
science
of
jurisprudence
that
exchange
bank
of
history
which
offers
to
exchange
historys
understanding
of
power
for
true
gold
j
power
is
the
collective
will
of
the
people
transferred
by
expressed
or
tacit
consent
to
their
chosen
rulers
.

in
the
domain
of
jurisprudence
which
con
sists
of
discussions
of
how
a
state
and
power
might
be
arranged
were
it
possible
for
all
that
to
be
arranged
it
is
all
very
clear
but
when
second
epilogue
681
applied
to
history
that
definition
of
power
needs
explanation
.
the
science
of
jurisprudence
regards
the
state
and
power
as
the
ancients
regarded
fire
namely
as
something
existing
absolutely
.
but
for
history
the
state
and
power
are
merely
phenomena
just
as
for
modern
physics
fire
is
not
an
element
but
a
phenomenon
.
from
this
fundamental
difference
between
the
view
held
by
history
and
that
held
by
ju
risprudence
it
follows
that
jurisprudence
can
tell
minutely
how
in
its
opinion
power
should
be
constituted
and
what
power
existing
im
mutably
outside
time
is
but
to
historys
ques
tions
about
the
meaning
of
the
mutations
of
power
in
time
it
can
answer
nothing
.
if
power
be
the
collective
will
of
the
people
transferred
to
their
ruler
was
pugachev
a
rep
resentative
of
the
will
of
the
people
if
not
then
why
was
napoleon
i
why
was
napoleon
iii
a
criminal
when
he
was
taken
prisoner
at
boulogne
and
why
later

crim
inals
whom
he
arrested
do
palace

in
which
sometimes
only
two
or
three
people
take
part
transfer
the
will
of
the
people
to
a
new
ruler
in
inter
national
relations
is
the
will
of
the
people
also
transferred
to
their
conqueror
was
the
will
of
the
confederation
of
the
rhine
transferred
to
napoleon
in
1806
was
the
will
of
the
rus
sian
people
transferred
to
napoleon
in
1809
when
our
army
in
alliance
with
the
french
went
to
fight
the
austrians
to
these
questions
three
answers
are
pos
sible
either
to
assume
i
that
the
will
of
the
people
is
always
unconditionally
transferred
to
the
ruler
or
rulers
they
have
chosen
and
that
therefore
every
emergence
of
a
new
pow
er
every
struggle
against
the
power
once
ap
pointed
should
be
absolutely
regarded
as
an
infringement
of
the
real
power
or
2
that
the
will
of
the
people
is
transferred
to
the
rulers
conditionally
under
definiteand
known
conditions
and
to
show
that
all
limitations
conflicts
and
even
destructions
of
power
re
sult
from
a
nonobservance
by
the
rulers
of
the
conditions
under
which
their
power
was
en
trusted
to
them
or
3
that
the
will
of
the
people
is
delegated
to
the
rulers
conditionally
but
that
the
conditions
are
unknown
and
in
definite
and
that
the
appearance
of
several
authorities
their
struggles
and
their
falls
re
sult
solely
from
the
greater
or
lesser
fulfill
ment
by
the
rulers
of
these
unknown
condi
tions
on
which
the
will
of
the
people
is
trans
ferred
from
some
people
to
others
.
and
these
are
the
three
ways
in
which
the
historians
do
explain
the
relation
of
the
peo
ple
to
their
rulers
.
some
historians
those
biographical
and
specialist
historians
already
referred
to
in
their
simplicity
failing
to
understand
the
ques
tion
of
the
meaning
of
power
seem
to
consider
that
the
collective
will
of
the
people
is
uncon
ditionally
transferred
to
historical
persons
and
therefore
when
describing
some
single
state
they
assume
that
particular
power
to
be
the
one
absolute
and
real
power
and
that
any
other
force
opposing
this
is
not
a
power
but
a
violation
of
power
mere
violence
.
their
theory
suitable
for
primitive
and
peaceful
periods
of
history
has
the
inconven
iencein
application
to
complex
and
stormy
periods
in
the
life
of
nations
during
which
various
powers
arise
simultaneously
and
strug
gle
with
one
another
that
a
legitimist
his
torian
will
prove
that
the
national
conven
tion
the
directory
and
bonaparte
were
mere
infringers
of
the
true
power
while
a
republi
can
and
a
bonapartist
will
prove
the
one
that
the
convention
and
the
other
that
the
empire
was
the
real
power
and
that
all
the
others
were
violations
of
power
.
evidently
the
ex
planations
furnished
by
these
historians
being
mutually
contradictory
can
only
satisfy
young
children
.
recognizing
the
falsity
of
this
view
of
his
tory
another
set
of
historians
say
that
power
rests
on
a
conditional
delegation
of
the
will
of
the
people
to
their
rulers
and
that
histori
cal
leaders
have
power
only
conditionally
on
carrying
out
the
program
that
the
will
of
the
people
has
by
tacit
agreement
prescribed
to
them
.
but
what
this
program
consists
in
these
historians
do
not
say
or
if
they
do
they
con
tinually
contradict
one
another
.
each
historian
according
to
his
view
of
what
constitutes
a
nations
progress
looks
for
these
conditions
in
the
greatness
wealth
free
dom
or
enlightenment
of
the
citizens
of
france
or
some
other
country
.
but
not
to
mention
the
historians
contradictions
as
to
the
nature
of
this
program
or
even
admitting
that
some
one
general
program
of
these
conditions
exists
the
facts
of
history
almost
always
contradict
that
theory
.
if
the
conditions
under
which
power
is
entrusted
consist
in
the
wealth
free
dom
and
enlightenment
of
the
people
how
is
it
that
louis
xiv
and
ivan
the
terrible
end
their
reigns
tranquilly
while
louis
xvi
and
charles
i
are
executed
by
their
people
to
682
war
and
peace
this
question
historians
reply
that
louis
xivs
activity
contrary
to
the
program
reacted
on
louis
xvi
.
but
why
did
it
not
react
on
louis
xiv
or
on
louis
xv
why
should
it
react
just
on
louis
xvi
and
what
is
the
time
limit
for
such
reactions
to
these
questions
there
are
and
can
be
no
answers
.
equally
little
does
this
view
explain
why
for
several
centuries
the
collective
will
is
not
withdrawn
from
certain
rulers
and
their
heirs
and
then
suddenly
dur
ing
a
period
of
fifty
years
is
transferred
to
the
convention
to
the
directory
to
napoleon
to
alexander
to
louis
xviii
to
napoleon
again
to
charles
x
to
louis
philippe
to
a
republi
can
government
and
to
napoleon
iii
.
when
explaining
these
rapid
transfers
of
the
peoples
will
from
one
individual
to
another
especially
in
view
of
international
relations
conquests
and
alliances
the
historians
are
obliged
to
admit
that
some
of
these
transfers
are
not
normal
delegations
of
the
peoples
will
but
are
accidents
dependent
on
cunning
on
mistakes
on
craft
or
on
the
weakness
of
a
diplomatist
a
ruler
or
a
party
leader
.
so
that
the
greater
part
of
the
events
of
history
civil
wars
revolu
tions
and
conquests
are
presented
by
these
historians
not
as
the
results
of
free
transfer
ences
of
the
peoples
will
but
as
results
of
the
illdirected
will
of
one
or
more
individuals
that
is
once
again
as
usurpations
of
power
.
and
so
these
historians
also
see
and
admit
his
torical
events
which
are
exceptions
to
the
theory
.
these
historians
resemble
a
botanist
who
having
noticed
that
some
plants
grow
from
seeds
producing
two
cotyledons
should
insist
that
all
that
grows
does
so
by
sprouting
into
two
leaves
and
that
the
palm
the
mushroom
and
even
the
oak
which
blossom
into
full
growth
and
no
longer
resemble
two
leaves
are
deviations
from
the
theory
.
historians
of
the
third
class
assume
that
the
will
of
the
people
is
transferred
to
historic
per
sonages
conditionally
but
that
the
conditions
are
unknown
to
us
.
they
say
that
historical
personages
have
power
only
because
they
ful
fill
the
will
of
the
people
which
has
been
dele
gated
to
them
.
but
in
that
case
if
the
force
that
moves
na
tions
lies
not
in
the
historic
leaders
but
in
the
nations
themselves
what
significance
have
those
leaders
the
leaders
these
historians
tell
us
express
the
will
of
the
people
the
activity
of
the
lead
ers
represents
the
activity
of
the
people
.
but
in
that
case
the
question
arises
whether
all
the
activity
of
the
leaders
serves
as
an
ex
pression
of
the
peoples
will
or
only
some
part
of
it
.
if
the
whole
activity
of
the
leaders
serves
as
the
expression
of
the
peoples
will
as
some
historians
suppose
then
all
the
details
of
the
court
scandals
contained
in
the
biographies
of
a
napoleon
or
a
catherine
serve
to
express
the
life
of
the
nation
which
is
evident
non
sense
but
if
it
is
only
some
particular
side
of
the
activity
of
an
historical
leader
which
serves
to
express
the
peoples
life
as
other
socalled
philosophical
historians
believe
then
to
de
termine
which
side
of
the
activity
of
a
leader
expresses
the
nations
life
we
have
first
of
all
to
know
in
what
the
nations
life
consists
.
met
by
this
difficulty
historians
of
that
class
devise
some
most
obscure
impalpable
and
general
abstraction
which
can
cover
all
con
ceivable
occurrences
and
declare
this
abstrac
tion
to
be
the
aim
of

.
the
most
usual
generalizations
adopted
by
al
most
all
the
historians
are
freedom
equality
enlightenment

ture

683
chapter
v
the
life
of
the
nations
is
not
contained
in
the
lives
of
a
few
men
for
the
connection
between
those
men
and
the
nations
has
not
been
found
.
the
theory
that
this
connection
is
based
on
the
transference
of
the
collective
will
of
a
peo
ple
to
certain
historical
personages
is
an
hy
pothesis
unconfirmed
by
the
experience
of
his
tory
.
the
theory
of
the
transference
of
the
collec
tive
will
of
the
people
to
historic
persons
may
perhaps
explain
much
in
the
domain
of
juris
prudence
and
be
essential
for
its
purposes
but
in
its
application
to
history
as
soon
as
revolu
tions
conquests
or
civil
wars
occur
that
is
as
soon
as
history
begins
that
theory
explains
nothing
.
the
theory
seems
irrefutable
just
because
the
act
of
transference
of
the
peoples
will
can
not
be
verified
for
it
never
occurred
.
whatever
happens
and
whoever
may
stand
at
the
head
of
affairs
the
theory
can
always
say
that
such
and
such
a
person
took
the
lead
because
the
collective
will
was
transferred
to
him
.
the
replies
this
theory
gives
to
historical
questions
are
like
the
replies
of
a
man
who
watching
the
movements
of
a
herd
of
cattle
and
paying
no
attention
to
the
varying
quality
of
the
pasturage
in
different
parts
of
the
field
or
to
the
driving
of
the
herdsman
should
at
tribute
the
direction
the
herd
takes
to
what
animal
happens
to
be
at
its
head
.
the
herd
goes
in
that
direction
because
the
animal
in
front
leads
it
and
the
collective
will
of
all
the
other
animals
is
vested
in
that
leader
.
this
is
what
historians
of
the
first
class
say
those
who
assume
the
unconditional
transference
of
the
peoples
will
.
if
the
animals
leading
the
herd
change
this
happens
because
the
collective
will
of
all
the
animals
is
transferred
from
one
leader
to
an
other
according
to
whether
the
animal
is
or
is
not
leading
them
in
the
direction
selected
by
the
whole
herd
.
such
is
the
reply
of
his
torians
who
assume
that
the
collective
will
of
the
people
is
delegated
to
rulers
under
condi
tions
which
they
regard
as
known
.
with
this
method
of
observation
it
often
happens
that
the
observer
influenced
by
the
direction
he
himself
prefers
regards
those
as
leaders
who
owing
to
the
peoples
change
of
direction
are
no
longer
in
front
but
on
one
side
or
even
in
the
rear
.
if
the
animals
in
front
are
continually
changing
and
the
direction
of
the
whole
herd
is
constantly
altered
this
is
because
in
order
to
follow
a
given
direction
the
animals
trans
fer
their
will
to
the
animals
that
have
attracted
our
attention
and
to
study
the
movements
of
the
herd
we
must
watch
the
movements
of
all
the
prominent
animals
moving
on
all
sides
of
the
herd
.
so
say
the
third
class
of
historians
who
regard
all
historical
persons
from
mon
archs
to
journalists
as
the
expression
of
their
age
.
the
theory
of
the
transference
of
the
will
of
the
people
to
historic
persons
is
merely
a
paraphrase
a
restatement
of
the
question
in
other
words
.
what
causes
historical
events
power
.
what
is
power
power
is
the
collective
will
of
the
people
transferred
to
one
person
.
under
what
condition
is
the
will
of
the
people
delegated
684
war
and
peace
to
one
person
on
condition
that
that
person
expresses
the
will
of
the
whole
people
.
that
is
power
is
power
in
other
words
power
is
a
word
the
meaning
of
which
we
do
not
under
stand
.
if
the
realm
of
human
knowledge
were
con
fined
to
abstract
reasoning
then
having
sub
jected
to
criticism
the
explanation
of
power
that
juridical
science
gives
us
humanity
would
conclude
that
power
is
merely
a
word
and
has
no
real
existence
.
but
to
understand
phenom
ena
man
has
besides
abstract
reasoning
ex
perience
by
which
he
verifies
his
reflections
.
and
experience
tells
us
that
power
is
not
mere
ly
a
word
but
an
actually
existing
phenomenon
.
not
to
speak
of
the
fact
that
no
description
of
the
collective
activity
of
men
can
do
with
out
the
conception
of
power
the
existence
of
power
is
proved
both
by
history
and
by
ob
serving
contemporary
events
.
whenever
an
event
occurs
a
man
appears
or
men
appear
by
whose
will
the
event
seems
to
have
taken
place
.
napoleon

issues
a

and
the
french

the

of

and

experience
shows
us
that
what
ever
event
occurs
it
is
always
related
to
the
will
of
one
or
of
several
men
who
have
de
creed
it
.
the
historians
in
accord
with
the
old
habit
of
acknowledging
divine
intervention
in
hu
man
affairs
want
to
see
the
cause
of
events
in
the
expression
of
the
will
of
someone
endowed
with
power
but
that
supposition
is
not
con
firmed
either
by
reason
or
by
experience
.
on
the
one
side
reflection
shows
that
the
expression
of
a
mans
willhis
words
are
only
part
of
the
general
activity
expressed
in
an
event
as
for
instance
in
a
war
or
a
revolution
and
so
without
assuming
an
incomprehensible
supernatural
force
a
miracle
one
cannot
ad
mit
that
words
can
be
the
immediate
cause
of
the
movements
of
millions
of
men
.
on
the
other
hand
even
if
we
admitted
that
words
could
be
the
cause
of
events
history
shows
that
the
expression
of
the
will
of
historical
personages
does
not
in
most
cases
produce
any
effect
that
is
to
say
their
commands
are
often
not
executed
and
sometimes
the
very
opposite
of
what
they
order
occurs
.
without
admitting
divine
intervention
in
the
affairs
of
humanity
we
cannot
regard
power
as
the
cause
of
events
.
power
from
the
standpoint
of
experience
is
merely
the
relation
that
exists
between
the
expression
of
someones
will
and
the
execu
tion
of
that
will
by
others
.
to
explain
the
conditions
of
that
relation
ship
we
must
first
establish
a
conception
of
the
expression
of
will
referring
it
to
man
and
not
to
the
deity
.
if
the
deity
issues
a
command
expresses
his
will
as
ancient
history
tells
us
the
ex
pression
of
that
will
is
independent
of
time
and
is
not
caused
by
anything
for
the
divinity
is
not
controlled
by
an
event
.
but
speaking
of
commands
that
are
the
expression
of
the
will
of
men
acting
in
time
and
in
relation
to
one
another
to
explain
the
connection
of
com
mands
with
events
we
must
restore
i
the
condition
of
all
that
takes
place
the
conti
nuity
of
movement
in
time
both
of
the
events
and
of
the
person
who
commands
and
2
the
inevitability
of
the
connection
between
the
person
commanding
and
those
who
execute
his
command
.
chapter
vi
only
the
expression
of
the
will
of
the
deity
not
dependent
on
time
can
relate
to
a
whole
series
of
events
occurringover
a
period
of
years
or
centuries
and
only
the
deity
independent
of
everything
can
by
his
sole
will
determine
the
direction
of
humanitys
movement
but
man
acts
in
time
and
himself
takes
part
in
what
occurs
.
reinstating
the
first
condition
omitted
that
of
time
we
see
that
no
command
can
be
ex
ecuted
without
some
preceding
order
having
been
given
rendering
the
execution
of
the
last
command
possible
.
no
command
ever
appears
spontaneously
or
itself
covers
a
whole
series
of
occurrences
but
each
command
follows
from
another
and
never
refers
to
a
whole
series
of
events
but
always
to
one
moment
only
of
an
event
.
when
for
instance
we
say
that
napoleon
ordered
armies
to
go
to
war
we
combine
in
one
simultaneous
expression
a
whole
series
of
consecutive
commands
dependent
one
on
an
other
.
napoleon
could
not
have
commanded
an
invasion
of
russia
and
never
did
so
.
today
he
ordered
such
and
such
papers
to
be
written
to
vienna
to
berlin
and
to
petersburg
to
morrow
such
and
such
decrees
and
orders
to
the
army
the
fleet
the
commissariat
and
so
on
and
so
on
millions
of
commands
which
formed
a
whole
series
corresponding
to
a
series
of
events
which
brought
the
french
armies
in
to
russia
.
if
throughout
his
reign
napoleon
gave
com
mands
concerning
an
invasion
of
england
and
expended
on
no
other
undertaking
so
much
time
and
effort
and
yet
during
his
whole
reign
never
once
attempted
to
execute
that
design
but
undertook
an
expedition
into
russia
with
which
country
he
considered
it
desirable
to
be
in
alliance
a
conviction
he
repeatedly
ex
pressed
this
came
about
because
his
com
mands
did
not
correspond
to
the
course
of
events
in
the
first
case
but
did
so
correspond
in
the
latter
.
for
an
order
to
be
certainly
executed
it
is
necessary
that
a
man
should
order
what
can
be
executed
.
but
to
know
what
can
and
what
cannot
be
executed
is
impossible
not
only
in
the
case
of
napoleons
invasion
of
russia
in
which
millions
participated
but
even
in
the
simplest
event
for
in
either
case
millions
of
obstacles
may
arise
to
prevent
its
execution
.
every
order
executed
is
always
one
of
an
im
mense
number
unexecuted
.
all
the
impossible
orders
inconsistent
with
the
course
of
events
remain
unexecuted
.
only
the
possible
ones
get
linked
up
with
a
consecutive
series
of
com
mands
corresponding
to
a
series
of
events
and
are
executed
.
our
false
conception
that
an
event
is
caused
by
a
command
which
precedes
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
when
the
event
has
taken
place
and
out
of
thousands
of
others
those
few
com
mands
which
were
consistent
with
that
event
have
been
executed
we
forget
about
the
others
that
were
not
executed
because
they
could
not
be
.
apart
from
that
the
chief
source
of
our
error
in
this
matter
is
due
to
the
fact
that
in
the
historical
accounts
a
whole
series
of
innumerable
diverse
and
petty
events
such
for
instance
as
all
those
which
led
the
french
armies
to
russia
is
generalized
into
one
event
in
accord
with
the
result
produced
by
that
series
of
events
and
corresponding
with
this
generalization
the
whole
series
of
commands
is
also
generalized
into
a
single
expression
of
will
.
we
say
that
napoleon
wished
to
invade
russia
and
invaded
it
.
in
reality
in
all
na
poleons
activity
we
never
find
anything
re
sembling
an
expression
of
that
wish
but
find
a
series
of
orders
or
expressions
of
his
will
very
variously
and
indefinitely
directed
.
amid
a
long
series
of
unexecuted
orders
of
napo
leons
one
series
for
the
campaign
of
1812
was
carried
out
not
because
those
orders
differed
second
epilogue
685
in
any
way
from
the
other
unexecuted
orders
but
because
they
coincided
with
the
course
of
events
that
led
the
french
army
into
russia
just
as
in
stencil
work
this
or
that
figure
comes
out
not
because
the
color
was
laid
on
from
this
side
or
in
that
way
but
because
it
was
laid
on
from
all
sides
over
the
figure
cut
in
the
stencil
.
so
that
examining
the
relation
in
time
of
the
commands
to
the
events
we
find
that
a
command
can
never
be
the
cause
of
the
event
but
that
a
certain
definite
dependence
exists
between
the
two
.
to
understand
in
what
this
dependence
consists
it
is
necessary
to
reinstate
another
omitted
condition
of
every
command
proceed
ing
not
from
the
deity
but
from
a
man
which
is
that
the
man
who
gives
the
command
him
self
takes
part
in
the
event
.
this
relation
of
the
commander
to
those
he
commands
is
just
what
is
called
power
.
this
relation
consists
in
the
following
for
common
action
people
always
unite
in
certain
combinations
in
which
regardless
of
the
difference
of
the
aims
set
for
the
common
action
the
relation
between
those
taking
part
in
it
is
always
the
same
.
men
uniting
in
these
combinations
always
assume
such
relations
toward
one
another
that
the
larger
number
take
a
more
direct
share
and
the
smaller
number
a
less
direct
share
in
the
collective
action
for
which
they
have
com
bined
.
of
all
the
combinations
in
which
men
unite
for
collective
action
one
of
the
most
striking
and
definite
examples
is
an
army
.
every
army
is
composed
of
lower
grades
of
the
servicethe
rank
and

of
whom
there
are
always
the
greatest
number
of

are

of
whom
there
are
still
fewer
and
so
on
to
the
highest
military
command
which
is
concentrated
in
one
per
son
.
a
military
organization
may
be
quite
cor
rectly
compared
to
a

of
which
the

with

consists
of

the

higher
and
smaller
section
of

of

of

and
so
on
to
the
apex
the
point
of
which
will
represent
the
commander
in

.
the
soldiers
of
whom

the

of
whom
there
are
fewer

itself
less
fre
quently
than
the
soldiers
but
they
already

the

never
takes
direct
part
in
the
action
itself
but
only
gives
general
orders
concerning
the
movement
of
the
mass
of
the
troops
.
a
similar
relation
of
people
to
one
another
is
seen
in
every
combination
of
men
for

activityin

and
every

.
and
so
without
particularly
analyzing
all
the
contiguous
sections
of
a

and
of
the
ranks
of
an
army
or
the
ranks
and
positions
in
any
administrative
or
public
business
what
ever
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
we
see
a
law
by
which
men
to
take

action
combine
in
such
relations
that
the
more
di
rectly
they
participate
in
performing
the
ac

the
less
they
can
command
and
the
more
numerous
they
are
while
the
less
their
direct
participation
in
the
action
itself
the
more
they
command
and
the
fewer
of
them
there
are
rising
in
this
way
from
the
lowest
ranks
to
the
man
at
the

this
relation
of

who

is
what
constitutes
the

of
the
conception
called
power

having

chapter

when
an
event
is
taking
place
people
express
their
opinions
and
wishes
about
it
and
as
the
event
results
from
the
collective
activity
of
many
people
some
one
of
the
opinions
or
wishes
expressed
is
sure
to
be
fulfilled
if
but
approximately
.
when
one
of
the
opinions
ex
pressed
is
fulfilled
that
opinion
gets
connected
with
the
event
as
a
command
preceding
it
.
men
are
hauling
a
log
.
each
of
them
ex
presses
his
opinion
as
to
how
and
where
to
haul
it
.
they
haul
the
log
away
and
it
hap
pens
that
this
is
done
as
one
of
them
said
.
he
ordered
it
.
there
we
have
command
and
pow
er
in
their
primary
form
.
the
man
who
worked
most
with
his
hands
could
not
think
so
much
about
what
he
was
doing
or
reflect
on
or
com
mand
what
would
result
from
the
common
activity
while
the
man
who
commanded
more
would
evidently
work
less
with
his
hands
on
account
of
his
greater
verbal
activity
.
when
some
larger
concourse
of
men
direct
their
activity
to
a
common
aim
there
is
a
yet
sharper
division
of
those
who
because
their
activity
is
given
to
directing
and
commanding
take
less
part
in
the
direct
work
.
when
a
man
works
alone
he
always
has
a
certain
set
of
reflections
which
as
it
seems
to
him
directed
his
past
activity
justify
his
pres
ent
activity
and
guide
him
in
planning
his
future
actions
.
just
the
same
is
done
by
a
con
course
of
people
allowing
those
who
do
not
take
a
direct
part
in
the
activity
to
devise
considerations
justifications
and
surmises
con
cerning
their
collective
activity
.
for
reasons
known
or
unknown
to

and

people
ceased
to
kill
one
another
and
this
event
was
accompanied
by
its
justification
in
the
necessity
for
a
central
ization
of
power
resistance
to
europe
and
so
on
.
men
went
from
the
west
to
the
east
killing
their
fellow
men
and
the
event
was
accom
panied
by
phrases
about
the
glory
of
france
the
baseness
of
england
and
so
on
.
history
shows
us
that
these
justifications
of
the
events
have
no
common
sense
and
are
all
contradic
tory
as
in
the
case
of
killing
a
man
as
the
re
sult
of
recognizing
his
rights
and
the
killing
of
millions
in
russia
for
the
humiliation
of
england
.
but
these
justifications
have
a
very
necessary
significance
in
their
own
day
.
these
justifications
release
those
who
pro
duce
the
events
from
moral
responsibility
.
these
temporary
aims
are
like
the
broom
fixed
in
front
of
a
locomotive
to
clear
the
snow
from
the
rails
in
front
they
clear
mens
moral
re
sponsibilities
from
their
path
.
without
such
justification
there
would
be
no
reply
to
the
simplest
question
that
presents
itself
when
examining
each
historical
event
.
how
is
it
that
millions
of
men
commit

and
so
on
with
the
present
complex
forms
of
political
and
social
life
in
europe
can
any
event
that
is
not
prescribed
decreed
or
ordered
by
mon
archs
ministers
parliaments
or
newspapers
be
imagined
is
there
any
collective
action
which
cannot
find
its
justification
in
political
unity
in
patriotism
in
the
balance
of
power
or
in
civilization
so
that
every
event
that
occurs
inevitably
coincides
with
some
expressed
wish
and
receiving
a
justification
presents
itself
as
the
result
of
the
will
of
one
man
or
of
several
men
.
in
whatever
direction
a

every

it
is
oc
casioned
by
the

that

but
wherever
it
may
turn
there
always
will
be
the
wave
anticipating
its
movement
.
whatever
happens
it
always
appears
that
just
that

was
foreseen
and
decreed
.

the

examining
only
those
expressions
of
the
will
of
historical
persons
which
as
commands
were
related
to
events
historians
have
assumed
that
the
events
depended
on
those
com
mands
.
but
examining
the
events
themselves
and
the
connection
in
which
the
historical
persons
stood
to
the
people
we
have
found
that
they
and
their
orders
were
dependent
on
events
.
the
incontestable
proof
of
this
deduc
tion
is
that
however
many
commands
were
issued
the
event
does
not
take
place
unless
there
are
other
causes
for
it
but
as
soon
as
an
event
occurs
be
it
what
it
may
then
out
of
all
the
continually
expressed
wishes
of
dif
ferent
people
some
will
always
be
found
which
by
their
meaning
and
their
time
of
utterance
are
related
as
commands
to
the
events
.
arriving
at
this
conclusion
we
can
reply
di
rectly
and
positively
to
these
two
essential
questions
of
history
1
what
is
power
2
what
force
produces
the
movement
of
the
nations
1
power
is
the
relation
of
a
given
person
to
other
individuals
in
which
the
more
this
person
expresses
opinions
predictions
and
justifications
of
the
collective
action
that
is
performed
the
less
is
his
participation
in
that
action
.
2
the
movement
of
nations
is
caused
not
by
power
nor
by
intellectual
activity
nor
even
by
a
combination
of
the
two
as
historians
have
supposed
but
by
the
activity
of
all
the
people
who
participate
in
the
events
and
who
always
combine
in
such
a
way
that
those
tak
ing
the
largest
direct
share
in
the
event
take
on
themselves
the
least
responsibility
and
vice
versa
.
morally
the
wi
elder
of
power
appears
to
cause
the
event
physically
it
is
those
who
sub
mit
to
the
power
.
but
as
the
moral
activity
is
inconceivable
without
the
physical
the
cause
of
the
event
is
neither
in
the
one
nor
in
the
other
but
in
the
union
of
the
two
.
or
in
other
words
the
conception
of
a
cause
is
inapplicable
to
the
phenomena
we
are
ex
amining
.
in
the
last
analysis
we
reach
the
circle
of
infinity
that
final
limit
to
which
in
every

of

arrives
if

chapter

if
history
dealt
only
with
external
phenom
ena
the
establishment
of
this
simple
and
ob
vious
law
would
suffice
and
we
should
have
finished
our
argument
.
but
the
law
of
history
relates
to
man
.
a
particle
of
matter
cannot
tell
us
that
it
does
not
feel
the
law
of
attraction
or
repulsion
and
that
that
law
is
untrue
but
man
who
is
thesubject
of
history
says
plainly
i
am
free
and
am
therefore
not
subject
to
the
law
.
the
presence
of
the
problem
of
mans
free
will
though
unexpressed
is
felt
at
every
step
of
history
.
all
seriously
thinking
historians
have
in
voluntarily
encountered
this
question
.
all
the
contradictions
and
obscurities
of
history
and
the
false
path
historical
science
has
followed
are
due
solely
to
the
lack
of
a
solution
of
that
question
.
if
the
will
of
every
man
were
free
that
is
if
each
man
could
act
as
he
pleased
all
history
would
be
a
series
of
disconnected
incidents
.
if
in
a
thousand
years
even
one
man
in
a
million
could
act
freely
that
is
as
he
chose
it
is
evident
that
one
single
free
act
of
that
mans
in
violation
of
the
laws
governing
hu
man
action
would
destroy
the
possibility
of
the
existence
of
any
laws
for
die
whole
of
humanity
.
if
there
be
a
single
law
governing
the
ac
tions
of
men
free
will
cannot
exist
for
then
mans
will
is
subject
to
that
law
.
in
this
contradiction
lies
the
problem
of
free
will
which
from
most
ancient
times
has
occupied
the
best
human
minds
and
from
most
ancient
times
has
been
presented
in
its
whole
tremendous
significance
.
the
problem
is
that
regarding
man
as
a
sub
ject
of
observation
from
whatever
point
of
view
theological
historical
ethical
or
phil
osophicwe
find
a
general
law
of
necessity
to
which
he
like
all
that
exists
is
subject
.
but
regarding
him
from
within
ourselves
as
what
we
are
conscious
of
we
feel
ourselves
to
be
free
.
this
consciousness
is
a
source
of
selfcogni
tion
quite
apart
from
and
independent
of
reason
.
through
his
reason
man
observes
him
self
but
only
through
consciousness
does
he
know
himself
.
apart
from
consciousness
of
self
no
observa
tion
or
application
of
reason
is
conceivable
.
to
understand
observe
and
draw
conclu
sions
man
must
first
of
all
be
conscious
of
him
self
as
living
.
a
man
is
only
conscious
of
him
self
as
a
living
being
by
the
fact
that
he
wills
that
is
is
conscious
of
his
volition
.
but
his
will
which
forms
the
essence
of
his
life
man
recognizes
and
can
but
recognize
as
free
.
if
observing
himself
man
sees
that
his
will
is
always
directed
by
one
and
the
same
law
whether
he
observes
the
necessity
of
taking
food
using
his
brain
or
anything
else
he
can
not
recognize
this
nevervarying
direction
of
his
will
otherwise
than
as
a
limitation
of
it
.
were
it
not
free
it
could
not
be
limited
.
a
mans
will
seems
to
him
to
be
limited
just
be
cause
he
is
not
conscious
of
it
except
as
free
.
you
say
i
am
not
free
.
but
i
have
lifted
my
hand
and
let
it
fall
.
everyone
understands
that
this
illogical
reply
is
an
irrefutable
dem
onstration
of
freedom
.
that
reply
is
the
expression
of
a
conscious
ness
that
is
not
subject
to
reason
.
if
the
consciousness
of
freedom
were
not
a
separate
and
independent
source
of
selfcon
sciousness
it
would
be
subject
to
reasoning
and
to
experience
but
in
fact
such
subjection
does
not
exist
and
is
inconceivable
.
a
series
of
experiments
and
arguments
proves
to
every
man
that
he
as
an
object
of
observation
is
subject
to
certain
laws
and
man
submits
to
them
and
never
resists
the
laws
of
gravity
or
impermeability
once
he
has
become
acquainted
with
them
.
but
the
same
series
of
experiments
and
arguments
proves
to
him
that
the
complete
freedom
of
which
he
is
conscious
in
himself
is
impossible
and
that
his
every
action
depends
on
his
organization
his
char
acter
and
the
motives
acting
upon
him
yet
man
never
submits
to
the
deductions
of
these
experiments
and
arguments
.
having
learned
from
experiment
and
argument
that
a
stone
falls
downwards
a
man
indubitably
believes
this
and
always
expects
the
law
that
he
has
learned
to
be
fulfilled
.
but
learning
just
as
certainly
that
his
will
is
subject
to
laws
he
does
not
and
cannot
be
lieve
this
.
however
often
experiment
and
reasoning
may
show
a
man
that
under
the
same
condi
tions
and
with
the
same
character
he
will
do
the
same
thing
as
before
yet
when
under
the
same
conditions
an
with
the
same
character
he
approaches
for
the
thousandth
time
the
ac
tion
that
always
ends
in
the

way
he
feels

convinced
as

question
for

only
in
our
selfconfident
day
of
the
popu
larization
of
knowledge
thanks
to
that
most
powerful
engine
of
ignorance
the
diffusion
of

has
the
question
of
the
free
dom
of
will
been
put
on
a
level
on
which
the
question
itself
cannot
exist
.
in
our
time
the
majority
of
socalled
advanced
people
that
is
the
crowd
of
ignoramuses
have
taken
the
work
of
the
naturalists
who
deal
with
one
side
of
the
question
for
a
solution
of
the
whole
problem
.
they
say
and
write
and
print
that
the
soul
and
freedom
do
not
exist

the
life
of

expressed
by

conditioned
by

ac
tivity

and

will
do
not
exist
because
at
an
unknown
period
of
time
we
sprang
from
the
apes

they
say
this
not
at
all
suspecting
that
thousands
of
years
ago
that
same
law
of
necessity
which
with
such
ardor
they
are
now
trying
to
prove
by
physiology
and
comparative
zoology
was
not
merely
acknowl
edged
by
all
the
religions
and
all
the
thinkers
but
has
never
been
denied
.
they
do
not
see
that
the
role
of
the
natural
sciences
in
this
matter
is
merely
to
serve
as
an
instrument
for
the
illumination
of
one
side
of
it
.
for
the
fact
that
from
the
point
of

reason

are
merely

brain
and
that
man
following
the
general
law
may
have
developed
from

at
some

only
explains
from
a
fresh
side
the
truth
admitted
thousands
of
years
ago
by
all
the
religious
and
philosophic
theories
that
from
the
point

of

is
subject
to
the

it
does
not

of
the
question

has
another

on
the
consciousness

if

descended
from

as
that
they
were

in
the
first
case
the

quantity
is
the

in
the

it
is
the

the
question
of
how
mans
consciousness
of
freedom
is
to
be
reconciled
with
the
law
of

to
which

in

chapter
ix
for
the
solution
of
the
question
of
free
will
or
inevitability
history
has
this
advantage
over
other
branches
of
knowledge
in
which
the
question
is
dealt
with
that
for
history
this
question
does
not
refer
to
the
essence
of
mans
free
will
but
to
its
manifestation
in
the
past
and
under
certain
conditions
.
in
regard
to
this
question
history
stands
to
the
other
sciences
as
experimental
science
stands
to
abstract
science
.
the
subject
for
history
is
not
mans
will
itself
but
our
presentation
of
it
.
and
so
for
history
the
insoluble
mystery
presented
by
the
incompatibility
of
free
will
and
inevitability
does
not
exist
as
it
does
for
theology
ethics
and
philosophy
.
history
sur
veys
a
presentation
of
mans
life
in
which
the
union
of
these
two
contradictions
has
already
taken
place
.
in
actual
life
each
historic
event
each
hu
man
action
is
very
clearly
and
definitely
un
derstood
without
any
sense
of
contradiction
although
each
event
presents
itself
as
partly
free
and
partly
compulsory
.
to
solve
the
question
of
how
freedom
and
necessity
are
combined
and
what
constitutes
the
essence
of
these
two
conceptions
the
phi
losophy
of
history
can
and
should
follow
a
path
contrary
to
that
taken
by
other
sciences
.
instead
of
first
defining
the
conceptions
of
free
dom
and
inevitability
in
themselves
and
then
ranging
the
phenomena
of
life
under
those
definitions
history
should
deduce
a
definition
of
the
conception
of
freedom
and
inevitability
themselves
from
the
immense
quantity
of
phe
nomena
of
which
it
is
cognizant
and
that
al
ways
appear
dependent
on
these
two
elements
.
whatever
presentation
of
the
activity
of
many
men
or
of
an
individual
we
may
con
sider
we
always
regard
it
as
the
result
partly
of
mans
free
will
and
partly
of
the
law
of
in
evitability
.
whether
we
speak
of
the
migration
of
the
peoples
and
the
incursions
of
the
barbarians
or
of
the
decrees
of
napoleon
hi
or
of
some
ones
action
an
hour
ago
in
choosing
one
direc
tion
out
of
several
for
his
walk
we
are
uncon
scious
of
any
contradiction
the
degree
of
free
dom
and
inevitability
governing
the
actions
of
these
people
is
clearly
defined
for
us
.
our
conception
of
the
degree
of
freedom
often
varies
according
to
differences
in
the
point
of
view
from
which
we
regard
the
event
but
every
human
action
appears
to
us
as
a
certain
combination
of
freedom
and
inevita
bility
.
in
every
action
we
examine
we
see
a
certain
measure
of
freedom
and
a
certain
measure
of
inevitability
.
and
always
the
more
freedom
we
see
in
any
action
the
less
inevita
bility
do
we
perceive
and
the
more
inevitabil
ity
the
less
freedom
.
the
proportion
of
freedom
to
inevitability
decreases
and
increases
according
to
the
point
of
view
from
which
the
action
is
regarded
but
their
relation
is
always
one
of
inverse
propor
tion
.
a
sinking
man
who
clutches
at
another
and
drowns
him
or
a
hungry
mother
exhausted
by
feeding
her
baby
who
steals
some
food
or
a
man
trained
to
discipline
who
on
duty
at
the
word
of
command
kills
a
defenseless
man
seem
less
guilty
that
is
less
free
and
more
subject
to
the
law
of
necessity
to
one
who
knows
the
circumstances
in
which
these
peo
ple
were
placed
and
more
free
to
one
who
does
not
know
that
the
man
was
himself
drowning
that
the
mother
was
hungry
that
the
soldier
was
in
the
ranks
and
so
on
.
similarly
a
man
who
committed
a
murder
twenty
years
ago
and
has
since
lived
peaceably
and
harmlessly
in
society
seems
less
guilty
and
his
action
more
due
to
the
law
of
inevitability
to
someone
who
considers
his
action
after
twenty
years
have
elapsed
than
to
one
who
examined
it
the
day
after
it
was
committed
.
and
in
the
same
way
every
action
of
an
insane
intoxicated
or
high
ly
excited
man
appears
less
free
and
more
in
evitable
to
one
who
knows
the
mental
condi
tion
of
him
who
committed
the
action
and
seems
more
free
and
less
inevitable
to
one
who
does
not
know
it
.
in
all
these
cases
the
con
ception
of
freedom
is
increased
or
diminished
and
the
conception
of
compulsion
is
corre
spondingly
decreased
or
increased
according
to
the
point
of
view
from
which
the
action
is
regarded
.
so
that
the
greater
the
conception
ol
necessity
the
smaller
the
conception
of
free
dom
and
vice
versa
.
religion
the
common
sense
of
mankind
the
science
of
jurisprudence
and
history
it
self
understand
alike
this
relation
between
second
epilogue
necessity
and
freedom
.
all
cases
without
exception
in
which
our
conception
of
freedom
and
necessity
is
in
creased
and
diminished
depend
on
three
con
siderations
1
the
relation
to
the
external
world
of
the
man
who
commits
the
deeds
.
2
his
relation
to
time
.
3
his
relation
to
the
causes
leading
to
the
action
.
the
first
consideration
is
the
clearness
of
our
perception
of
the
mans
relation
to
the
external
world
and
the
greater
or
lesser
clear
ness
of
our
understanding
of
the
definite
posi
tion
occupied
by
the
man
in
relation
to
every
thing
coexisting
with
him
.
this
is
what
makes
it
evident
that
a
drowning
man
is
less
free
and
more
subject
to
necessity
than
one
standing
on
dry
ground
and
that
makes
the
actions
of
a
man
closely
connected
with
others
in
a
thickly
populated
district
or
of
one
bound
by
family
official
or
business
duties
seem
certainly
less
free
and
more
subject
to
necessity
than
those
of
a
man
living
in
solitude
and
seclusion
.
if
we
consider
a
man
alone
apart
from
his
relation
to
everything
around
him
each
ac
tion
of
his
seems
to
us
free
.
but
if
we
see
his
relation
to
anything
around
him
if
we
see
his
connection
with
anything
whatever
with
a
man
who
speaks
to
him
a
book
he
reads
the
work
on
which
he
is
engaged
even
with
the
air
he
breathes
or
the
light
that
falls
on
the
things
about
him
we
see
that
each
of
these
circumstances
has
an
influence
on
him
and
controls
at
least
some
side
of
his
activity
.
and
the
more
we
perceive
of
these
influences
the
more
our
conception
of
his
freedom
dimin
ishes
and
the
more
our
conception
of
the
neces
sity
that
weighs
on
him
increases
.
the
second
consideration
is
the
more
or
less
evident
time
relation
of
the
man
to
the
world
and
the
clearness
of
our
perception
of
the
place
the
mans
action
occupies
in
time
.
that
is
the
ground
which
makes
the
fall
of
the
first
man
resulting
in
the
production
of
the
hu
man
race
appear
evidently
less
free
than
a
mans
entry
into
marriage
today
.
it
is
the
reason
why
the
life
and
activity
of
people
who
lived
centuries
ago
and
are
connected
with
me
in
time
cannot
seem
to
me
as
free
as
the
life
of
a
contemporary
the
consequences
of
which
are
still
unknown
to
me
.
the
degree
of
our
conception
of
freedom
or
inevitability
depends
in
this
respect
on
the
greater
or
lesser
lapse
of
time
between
the
per
formance
of
the
action
and
our
judgment
of
it
.
691
if
i
examine
an
act
i
performed
a
moment
ago
in
approximately
the
same
circumstances
as
those
i
am
in
now
my
action
appears
to
me
undoubtedly
free
.
but
if
i
examine
an
act
performed
a
month
ago
then
being
in
differ
ent
circumstances
i
cannot
help
recognizing
that
if
that
act
had
not
been
committed
much
that
resulted
from
it
good
agreeable
and
even
essential
would
not
have
taken
place
.
if
i
reflect
on
an
action
still
more
remote
ten
years
ago
or
more
then
the
consequences
of
my
action
are
still
plainer
to
me
and
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
what
would
have
happened
had
that
action
not
been
performed
.
the
farther
i
go
back
in
memory
or
what
is
the
same
thing
the
farther
i
go
forward
in
my
judgment
the
more
doubtful
becomes
my
belief
in
the
free
dom
of
my
action
.
in
history
we
find
a
very
similar
progress
of
conviction
concerning
the
part
played
by
free
will
in
the
general
affairs
of
humanity
.
a
con
temporary
event
seems
to
us
to
be
indubitably
the
doing
of
all
the
known
participants
but
with
a
more
remote
event
we
already
see
its
in
evitable
results
which
prevent
our
considering
anything
else
possible
.
and
the
farther
we
go
back
in
examining
events
the
less
arbitrary
do
they
appear
.
the
austroprussian
war
appears
to
us
un
doubtedly
the
result
of
the
crafty
conduct
of
bismarck
and
so
on
.
the
napoleonic
wars
still
seem
to
us
though
already
questionably
to
be
the
outcome
of
their
heroes
will
.
but
in
the
crusades
we
already
see
an
event
occupy
ing
its
definite
place
in
history
and
without
which
we
cannot
imagine
the
modern
history
of
europe
though
to
the
chroniclers
of
the
crusades
that
event
appeared
as
merely
due
to
the
will
of
certain
people
.
in
regard
to
the
migration
of
the
peoples
it
does
not
enter
any
ones
head
today
to
suppose
that
the
renova
tion
of
the
european
world
depended
on
at
tilas
caprice
.
the
farther
back
in
history
the
object
of
our
observation
lies
the
more
doubt
ful
does
the
free
will
of
those
concerned
in
the
event
become
and
the
more
manifest
the
law
of
inevitability
.
the
third
consideration
is
the
degree
to
which
we
apprehend
that
endless
chain
of
cau
sation
inevitably
demanded
by
reason
in
which
each
phenomenon
comprehended
and
therefore
mans
every
action
must
have
its
definite
place
as
a
result
of
what
has
gone
be
fore
and
as
a
cause
of
what
will
follow
.
the
better
we
are
acquainted
with
the
physi
ological
psychological
and
historical
laws
de
69
war
and
peace
duced
by
observation
and
by
which
man
is
con
trolled
and
the
more
correctly
we
perceive
the
physiological
psychological
and
historical
causes
of
the
action
and
the
simpler
the
action
we
are
observing
and
the
less
complex
the
character
and
mind
of
the
man
in
question
the
more
subject
to
inevitability
and
the
less
free
do
our
actions
and
those
of
others
appear
.
when
we
do
not
at
all
understand
the
cause
of
an
action
whether
a
crime
a
good
action
or
even
one
that
is
simply
nonmoral
we
ascribe
a
greater
amount
of
freedom
to
it
.
in
the
case
of
a
crime
we
most
urgently
demand
the
pun
ishment
for
such
an
act
in
the
case
of
a
virtu
ous
act
we
rate
its
merit
most
highly
.
in
an
indifferent
case
we
recognize
in
it
more
indi
viduality
originality
and
independence
.
but
if
even
one
of
the
innumerable
causes
of
the
act
is
known
to
us
we
recognize
a
certain
ele
ment
of
necessity
and
are
less
insistent
on
pun
ishment
for
the
crime
or
the
acknowledgment
of
the
merit
of
the
virtuous
act
or
the
freedom
of
the
apparently
original
action
.
that
a
crimi
nal
was
reared
among
malefactors
mitigates
his
fault
in
our
eyes
.
the
selfsacrifice
of
a
father
or
mother
or
selfsacrifice
with
the
possibility
of
a
reward
is
more
comprehensible
than
gra
tuitous
selfsacrifice
and
therefore
seems
less
deserving
of
sympathy
and
less
the
result
of
free
will
.
the
founder
of
a
sect
or
party
or
an
inventor
impresses
us
less
when
we
know
how
or
by
what
the
way
was
prepared
for
his
activ
ity
.
if
we
have
a
large
range
of
examples
if
our
observation
is
constantly
directed
to
seek
ing
the
correlation
of
cause
and
effect
in
peo
ples
actions
their
actions
appear
to
us
more
under
compulsion
and
less
free
the
more
cor
rectly
we
connect
the
effects
with
the
causes
.
if
we
examined
simple
actions
and
had
a
vast
number
of
such
actions
under
observation
our
conception
of
their
inevitability
would
be
still
greater
.
the
dishonest
conduct
of
the
son
of
a
dishonest
father
the
misconduct
of
a
woman
who
had
fallen
into
bad
company
a
drunkards
relapse
into
drunkenness
and
so
on
are
ac
tions
that
seem
to
us
less
free
the
better
we
understand
their
cause
.
if
the
man
whose
ac
tions
we
are

on
a
very
low
stage
of
mental
development
like
a

a
mad
man
or
a
simpleton
then
knowing
the
causes
of
the
act
and
the
simplicity
of
the
character
and
intelligence
in

we
see
so
large
an
element
of
necessity
and
so
little
free

that
as
soon
as
we
know
the
cause
prompting
the
action
we
can
foretell
the
result
.
on
these
three
considerations
alone
is
based
the
conception
of
irresponsibility
for

and
the

thus
our
conception
of
free
will
and
inevita
bility
gradually
diminishes
or
increases
ac
cording
to
the
greater
or
lesser
connection
with
the
external
world
the
greater
or
lesser
remoteness
of
time
and
the
greater
or
lesser
dependence
on
the
causes
in
relation
to
which
we
contemplate
a
mans
life
.
so
that
if
we
examine
the
case
of
a
man
whose
connection
with
the
external
world
is
well
known
where
the
time
between
the
action
and
its
examination
is
great
and
where
the
causes
of
the
action
are
most
accessible
we
get
the
conception
of
a
maximum
of
inevitability
and
a
minimum
of
free
will
.
if
we
examine
a
man
little
dependent
on
external
conditions
whose
action
was
performed
very
recently
and
the
causes
of
whose
action
are
beyond
our
ken
we
get
the
conception
of
a
minimum
of
inevitability
and
a
maximum
of
freedom
.
in
neither
case
however
we
may
change
our
point
of
view
however
plain
we
may
make
to
ourselves
the
connection
between
the
man
and
the
external
world
however
inaccessible
it
may
be
to
us
however
long
or
short
the
period
of
time
however
intelligible
or
incom
prehensible
the
causes
of
the
action
may
be
can
we
ever
conceive
either
complete
freedom
or
complete
necessity
.
i
to
whatever
degree
we
may
imagine
a
man
to
be
exempt
from
the
influence
of
the
external
world
we
never
get
a
conception
of
freedom
in
space
.
every
human
action
is
in
evitably
conditioned
by
what
surrounds
him
and
by
his
own
body
.
i
lift
my
arm
and
let
it
fall
.
my
action
seems
to
me
free
but
asking
myself
whether
i
could
raise
my
arm
in
every
direction
i
see
that
i
raised
it
in
the
direction
in
which
there
was
least
obstruction
to
that
action
either
from
things
around
me
or
from
the
construction
of
my
own
body
.
i
chose
one
out
of
all
the
possible
directions
because
in
it
there
were
fewest
obstacles
.
for
my
action
to
be
free
it
was
necessary
that
it
should
encoun
second
epilogue
ter
no
obstacles
.
to
conceive
of
a
man
being
free
we
must
imagine
him
outside
space
which
is
evidently
impossible
.

however
much
we
approximate
the
time
of
judgment
to
the
time
of
the
deed
we
never
get
a
conception
of
freedom
in
time
.
for
if
i
examine
an
action
committed
a
second
ago
i
must
still
recognize
it
as
not
being
free
for
it
is
irrevocably
linked
to
the
moment
at
which
it
was
committed
.
can
i
lift
my
arm
i
lift
it
but
ask
myself
could
i
have
abstained
from
lifting
my
arm
at
the
moment
that
has
already
passed
to
convince
myself
of
this
i
do
not
lift
it
the
next
moment
.
but
i
am
not
now
abstain

from
doing
so
at
the
first
moment
when
i
asked
the
question
.
time
has
gone
by
which
i
could
not
detain
the
arm
i
then
lifted
is
no
longer
the
same
as
the
arm
i
now
refrain
from
lifting
nor
is
the
air
in
which
i
lifted
it
the
same
that
now
surrounds
me
.
the
moment
in
which
the
first
movement
was
made
is
irrevoca
ble
and
at
that
moment
i
could
make
only
one
movement
and
whatever
movement
i
made
would
be
the
only
one
.
that
i
did
not
lift
my
arm
a
moment
later
does
not
prove
that
i
could
have
abstained
from
lifting
it
then
.
and
since
i
could
make
only
one
movement
at
that
single
moment
of
time
it
could
not
have
been
any
other
.
to
imagine
it
as
free
it
is
necessary
to
imagine
it
in
the
present
on
the
boundary
between
the
past
and
the
future
that
is
outside
time
which
is
impossible
.
3
however
much
the
difficulty
of
under
standing
the
causes
may
be
increased
we
never
reach
a
conception
of
complete
freedom
that
is
an
absence
ot
cause
.
however
inaccessible
to
us
may
be
the
cause
of
the
expression
of
will
in
any
action
our
own
or
anothers
the
first
demand
of
reason
is
the
assumption
of
and
search
for
a
cause
for
without
a
cause
no
phe
nomenon
is
conceivable
.
i
raise
my
arm
to
perform
an
action
independently
of
any
cause
but
my
wish
to
perform
an
action
without
a
cause
is
the
cause
of
my
action
.
but
even
if
imagining
a
man
quite
exempt
from
all
influences
examining
only
his
mo
mentary
action
in
the
present
unevoked
by
any
cause
we
were
to
admit
so
infinitely
small
a
remainder
of
inevitability
as
equaled
zero
we
should
even
then
not
have
arrived
at
the
conception
of
complete
freedom
in
man
for
a
being
uninfluenced
by
the
external
world
standing
outside
of
time
and
independent
of
cause
is
no
longer
a
man
.
in
the
same
way
we
can
never
imagine
the
action
of
a
man
quite
devoid
of
freedom
and
693
entirely
subject
to
the
law
of
inevitability
.
i
however
we
may
increase
our
knowl
edge
of
the
conditions
of
space
in
which
man
is
situated
that
knowledge
can
never
be
com
plete
for
the
number
of
those
conditions
is
as
infinite
as
the
infinity
of
space
.
and
therefore
so
long
as
not
all
the
conditions
influencing
men
are
defined
there
is
no
complete
inevita
bility
but
a
certain
measure
of
freedom
re
mains
.
a
however
we
may
prolong
the
period
of
time
between
the
action
we
are
examining
and
the
judgment
upon
it
that
period
will
be
finite
while
time
is
infinite
and
so
in
this
re
spect
too
there
can
never
be
absolute
inevita
bility
.
3
however
accessible
may
be
the
chain
of
causation
of
any
action
we
shall
never
know
the
whole
chain
since
it
is
endless
and
so
again
we
never
reach
absolute
inevitability
.
but
besides
this
even
if
admitting
the
re
maining
minimum
of
freedom
to
equal
zero
we
assumed
in
some
given
case
as
for
instance
in
that
of
a
dying
man
an
unborn
babe
or
an
idiot
complete
absence
of
freedom
by
so
do
ing
we
should
destroy
the
very
conception
of
man
in
the
case
we
are
examining
for
as
soon
as
there
is
no
freedom
there
is
also
no
man
.
and
so
the
conception
of
the
action
of
a
man
subject
solely
to
the
law
of
inevitability
with
out
any
element
of
freedom
is
just
as
impossi
ble
as
the
conception
of
a
mans
completely
free
action
.
and
so
to
imagine
the
action
of
a
man
en
tirely
subject
to
the
law
of
inevitability
with
out
any
freedom
we
must
assume
the
knowl
edge
of
an
infinite
number
of
space
relations
an
infinitely
long
period
of
time
and
an
in
finite
series
of
causes
.
to
imagine
a
man
perfectly
free
and
not
subject
to
the
law
of
inevitability
we
must
imagine
him
all
alone
beyond
space
beyond
time
and
free
from
dependence
on
cause
.
in
the
first
case
if
inevitability
were
possible
without
freedom
we
should
have
reached
a
definition
of
inevitability
by
the
laws
of
in
evitability
itself
that
is
a
mere
form
without
content
.
in
the
second
case
if
freedom
were
possible
without
inevitability
we
should
have
arrived
at
unconditioned
freedom
beyond
space
time
and
cause
which
by
the
fact
of
its
being
un
conditioned
and
unlimited
would
be
nothing
or
mere
content
without
form
.

we
should
in
fact
have
reached
those
two
fundamentals
of
which
mans
whole
outlook

inevita

without

is
mans

in
its
three
forms
.
freedom
is
the
thing
examined
.
inevitabil
ity
is
what
examines
.
freedom
is
the

.
inevitability
is
the
form
.
only
by
separating
the
two
sources
of
cogni
tion
related
to
one
another
as
form
to
con
tent
do
we
get
the
mutually
exclusive
and
separately
incomprehensible
conceptions
of
freedom
and
inevitability
.
only
by
uniting
them
do
we
get
a
clear
con
ception
of
mans
life
.
apart
from
these
two
concepts
which
in
their
union
mutually
define
one
another
as
form
and
content
no
conception
of
life
is
possible
.
all
that
we
know
of
the
life
of
man
is
merely
a
certain
relation
of
free
will
to
inevitability
that
is
of
consciousness
to
the
laws
of
reason
.
all
that
we
know
of
the
external
world
of
nature
is
only
a
certain
relation
of
the
forces
of
nature
to
inevitability
or
of
the
essence
of
life
to
the
laws
of
reason
.
the
great
natural
forces
lie
outside
us
and
we
are
not
conscious
of
them
we
call
those
forces
gravitation
inertia
electricity
animal
force
and
so
on
but
we
are
conscious
of
the
force
of
life
in
man
and
we
call
that
freedom
.
but
just
as
the
force
of
gravitation
incom
prehensible
in
itself
but
felt
by
every
man
is
understood
by
us
only
to
the
extent
to
which
we
know
the
laws
of
inevitability
to
which
it
is
subject
from
the
first
knowledge
that
all
bodies
have
weight
up
to
newtons
law
so
too
the
force
of
free
will
incomprehensible
in
itself
but
of
which
everyone
is
conscious
is
in
telligible
to
us
only
in
as
far
as
we
know
the
laws
of
inevitability
to
which
it
is
subject
from
the
fact
that
every
man
dies
up
to
the
knowledge
of
the
most
complex
economic
and
historic
laws
.
all
knowledge
is
merely
a
bringing
of
this
essence
of
life
under
the
laws
of
reason
.
mans
free
will
differs
from
every
other
force
in
that
man
is
directly
conscious
of
it
but
in
the
eyes
of
reason
it
in
no
way
differs
from
any
other

the
forces
of

electric

or

are
only
distinguished
from

that

are

just
so
the
force
of
mans
free
will
is
distinguished
by
reason
from
the
other
forces
of
natureonly
by
the
definition

freedom
apart
from

that
is
apart
from
the
laws

that
de
fine
it
differs
in
no
way
from
gravitation
or
heat
or
the
force
that
makes

for

it
is
only
a
momentary

and
as
the
undefinable

of
the

moving
the
heavenly

the
undefinable
essence
of
the

of
the
vital

the

of

and
so
on
just
in
the
same
way
does
the
force
of
free
will
form
the
con
tent
of
history
.
but
just
as
the
subject
of
every
science
is
the
manifestation
of
this
unknown
essence
of
life
while
that
essence
itself
can
only
be
the
subject
of
metaphysics
even
so
the
mani
festation
of
the
force
of
free
will
in
human
be
ings
in
space
in
time
and
in
dependence
on

forms
the
subject
of
history
while
free
will
itself
is
the
subject
of
metaphysics
.
in
the
experimental
sciences
what
we
know
we
call
the
laws
of
inevitability
what
is
un
known
to

we
call

vital
force
is
only
an
expression
lor
the
unknown
remainder
over

above
what
we

so
also
in
history
what
is
known
to
us
we
call
laws
of
inevitability
what
is
unknown
we
call
free
will
.
free

is
for

only
an
expression
for

of
what

about

chapter
xi
history
examines
the
manifestations
of
mans
free
will
in
connection
with
the
external
world
in
time
and
in
dependence
on
cause
that
is
second
epilogue
it
defines
this
freedom
by
the
laws
of
reason
and
so
history
is
a
science
only
in
so
far
as
this
free
will
is
defined
by
those
laws
.
the
recognition
of
mans
free
will
as
some
thing
capable
of
influencing
historical
events
that
is
as
not
subject
to
laws
is
the
same
for
history
as
the
recognition
of
a
free
force
mov
ing
the
heavenly
bodies
would
be
for
astron
omy
.
1hat
assumption
would
destroy
the
possi
bility
of
the
existence
of
la
that
is
of
any
science
whatever
.
if
there
is
even
a
single
body
moving
freely
then
the
laws
of
kepler
and
newton
are
negatived
and
no
conception
of
the
movement
of
the
heavenly
bodies
any
longer
exists
.
if
any
single
action
is
due
to
free
will
then
not
a
single
historical
law
can
exist
nor
any
conception
of
historical
events
.

for
history
lines
exist
of
the
movement
of
human
wills
one
end
of
which
is
hidden
in
the
unknown
but
at
the
other
end
of
which
a
con
sciousness
of
mans
will
in
the
present
moves
in
space
time
and
dependence
on
cause
.
the
more
this
field
of
motion
spreads
out
before
our
eyes
the
more
evident
are
the
laws
of
that
movement
.
to
discover
and
define
those
laws
is
the
problem
of
history
.
from
the
standpoint
from
which
the
science
of
history
now
regards
its
subject
on
the
path
it
now
follows
seeking
the
causes
of
events
in
mans
freewill
a
scientific
enunciation
of
those
laws
is
impossible
for
however
mans
free
will
may
be
restricted
as
soon
as
we
recognize
it
as
a
force
not
subject
to
law
the
existence
of
law
becomes
impossible
.
only
by
reducing
this
element
of
free
will
to
the
infinitesimal
that
is
by
regarding
it
as
an
infinitely
small
quantity
can
we
convince
ourselves
of
the
absolute
inaccessibility
of
the
causes
and
then
instead
of
seeking
causes
his
tory
will
take
the
discovery
of
laws
as
its
problem
.
the
search
for
these
laws
has
long
been
be
gun
and
the
new
methods
of
thought
which
history
must
adopt
are
being
worked
out
si
multaneously
with
the
selfdestruction
toward
whichever
dissecting

in
another
form
but
along
the

path
of
reflection
the
other
sciences
have
proceeded
.
when
newton
enunciated
the
law
of
gravity
he
did
not
say
that
the
sun
or
the
earth
had
a
property
of
attraction
he
said
that
all
bodies
from
the
largest
to
the
smallest
have
the
prop
erty
of
attracting
one
another
that
is
leaving
aside
the
question
of
the
cause
of
the
move
ment
of
the
bodies
he
expressed
the
property
common
to
all
bodies
from
the
infinitely
large
to
the
infinitely
sraall
.the
same
is
done
by
the
natural
sciences
leaving
aside
the
question
of
cause
they
seek
for
laws
.
history
stands
on
the
same
path
.
and
if
history
has
for
its
object
the
study
of
the
movement
of
the
nations
and
of
humanity
and
not
the
narration
of
episodes
in
the
lives
of
individuals
it
too
setting
aside
the
conception
of
cause
should
seek
the
laws
com
mon
to
all
the
inseparably
interconnected
in
finitesimal
elements
of
free
will
.
chapter
xii
from
the
time
the
law
of
copernicus
was
dis
covered
and
proved
the
mere
recognition
of
the
fact
that
it
was
not
the
sun
but
the
earth
that
moves
sufficed
to
destroy
the
whole
cos
mography
of
the
ancients
.
by
disproving
that
law
it
might
have
been
possible
to
retain
the
old
conception
of
the
movements
of
the
bodies
but
without
disproving
it
it
would
seem
im
possible
to
continue
studying
the
ptolemaic
worlds
.
but
even
after
the
discovery
of
the
law
of
copernicus
the
ptolemaic
worlds
were
still
studied
for
a
long
time
.
from
the
time
the
first
person
said
and
proved
that
the
number
of
births
or
of
crimes
is
subject
to
mathematical
laws
and
that
this
or
that
mode
of
government
is
determined
by
certain
geographical
and
economic
conditions
and
that
certain
relations
of
population
to
soil
produce
migrations
of
peoples
the
foundations
on
which
history
had
been
built
were
destroyed
in
their
essence
.
by
refuting
these
new
laws
the
former
view
of
history
might
have
been
retained
but
with
out
refuting
them
it
would
seem
impossible
to
continue
studying
historic
events
as
the
results
of
mans
free
will
.
for
if
a
certain
mode
of
gov
ernment
was
established
or
certain
migrations
of
peoples
took
place
in
consequence
of
such
and
such
geographic
ethnographic
or
eco
nomic
conditions
then
the
free
will
of
those
individuals
who
appear
to
us
to
have
estab
lished
that
mode
of
government
or
occasioned
696
the
migrations
can
no
longer
be
regarded
as
the
cause
.
and
yet
the
former
history
continues
to
be
studied
side
by
side
with
the
laws
of
statistics
geography
political
economy
comparative
philology
and
geology
which
directly
contra
dict
its
assumptions
.
the
struggle
between
the
old
views
and
the
new
was
long
and
stubbornly
fought
out
in
physical
philosophy
.
theology
stood
on
guard
for
the
old
views
and
accused
the
new
of
vio
lating
revelation
.
but
when
truth
conquered
theology
established
itself
just
as
firmly
on
the
new
foundation
.
just
as
prolonged
and
stubborn
is
the
strug
gle
now
proceeding
between
the
old
and
the
new
conception
of
history
and
theology
in
the
same
way
stands
on
guard
for
the
old
view
and
accuses
the
new
view
of
subverting
revelation
.
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
on
both
sides
the
struggle
provokes
passion
and
stifles
truth
.
on
the
one
hand
there
is
fear
and
regret
for
the
loss
of
the
whole
edifice
constructed
through
the
ages
on
the
other
is
the
passion
for
de
struction
.
to
the
men
who
fought
against
the
rising
truths
of
physical
philosophy
it
seemed
that
if
they
admitted
that
truth
it
would
destroy
faith
in
god
in
the
creation
of
the
firmament
and
in
the
miracle
of
joshua
the
son
of
nun
.
to
the
defenders
of
the
laws
of
copernicus
and
newton
to
voltaire
for
example
it
seemed
that
the
laws
of
astronomy
destroyed
religion
and
he
utilized
the
law
of
gravitation
as
a
weapon
against
religion
.
just
so
it
now
seems
as
if
we
have
only
to
admit
the
law
of
inevitability
to
destroy
the
conception
of
the
soul
of
good
and
evil
and
all
the
institutions
of
state
and
church
that
have
been
built
up
on
those
conceptions
.
so
too
like
voltaire
in
his
time
uninvited
war
and
peace
defenders
of
the
law
of
inevitability
today
use
that
law
as
a
weapon
against
religion
though
the
law
of
inevitability
in
history
like
the
law
of
copernicus
in
astronomy
far
from
de
stroying
even
strengthens
the
foundation
on
which
the
institutions
of
state
and
church
are
erected
.
as
in
the
question
of
astronomy
then
so
in
the
question
of
history
now
the
whole
differ
ence
of
opinion
is
based
on
the
recognition
or
nonrecognition
pf
something
absolute
serv
ing
as
the
measure
of
visible
phenomena
.
in
astronomy
it
was
the
immovability
of
the
earth
in
history
it
is
the
independence
of
per
sonalityfree
will
.
as
with
astronomy
the
difficulty
of
recogniz
ing
the
motion
of
the
earth
lay
in
abandoning
the
immediate
sensation
of
the
earths
fixity
and
of
the
motion
of
the
planets
so
in
history
the
difficulty
of
recognizing
the
subjection
of
personality
to
the
laws
of
space
time
and
cause
lies
in
renouncing
the
direct
feeling
of
the
in
dependence
of
ones
own
personality
.
but
as
in
astronomy
the
new
view
said
it
is
true
that
we
do
not
feel
the
movement
of
the
earth
but
by
admitting
its
immobility
we
arrive
at
ab
surdity
while
by
admitting
its
motion
which
we
do
not
feel
we
arrive
at
laws
so
also
in
history
the
new
view
says
it
is
true
that
we
are
not
conscious
of
our
dependence
but
by
admitting
our
free
will
we
arrive
at
absurdity
while
by
admitting
our
dependence
on
the
external
world
on
time
and
on
cause
we
arrive
at
laws
.
in
the
first
case
it
was
necessary
to
renounce
the
consciousness
of
an
unreal
immobility
in
space
and
to
recognize
a
motion
we
did
not
feel
in
the
present
case
it
is
similarly
necessary
to
renounce
a
freedom
that
does
not
exist
and
to
recognize
a
dependence
of
which
we
are
not
conscious
.
