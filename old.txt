ernest
hemingway
the
old
man
and
the
sea
to
charlie
shribner
and
to
max
perkins
he
was
an
old
man
who
fished
alone
in
a
skiff
in
the
gulf
stream
and
he
had
gone
eightyfour
days
now
without
taking
a
fish
.
in
the
first
forty
days
a
boy
had
been
with
him
.
but
after
forty
days
without
a
fish
the
boys
parents
had
told
him
that
the
old
man
was
now
definitely
and
finally
salao
which
is
the
worst
form
of
unlucky
and
the
boy
had
gone
at
their
orders
in
another
boat
which
caught
three
good
fish
the
first
week
.
it
made
the
boy
sad
to
see
the
old
man
come
in
each
day
with
his
skiff
empty
and
he
always
went
down
to
help
him
carry
either
the
coiled
lines
or
the
gaff
and
harpoon
and
the
sail
that
was
furled
around
the
mast
.
the
sail
was
patched
with
flour
sacks
and
furled
it
looked
like
the
flag
of
permanent
defeat
.
the
old
man
was
thin
and
gaunt
with
deep
wrinkles
in
the
back
of
his
neck
.
the
brown
blotches
of
the
benevolent
skin
cancer
the
sun
brings
from
its
reflection
on
the
tropic
sea
were
on
his
cheeks
.
the
blotches
ran
well
down
the
sides
of
his
face
and
his
hands
had
the
deepcreased
scars
from
handling
heavy
fish
on
the
cords
.
but
none
of
these
scars
were
fresh
.
they
were
as
old
as
erosions
in
a
fishless
desert
.
everything
about
him
was
old
except
his
eyes
and
they
were
the
same
color
as
the
sea
and
were
cheerful
and
undefeated
.
santiago
the
boy
said
to
him
as
they
climbed
the
bank
from
where
the
skiff
was
hauled
up
.
i
could
go
with
you
again
.
weve
made
some
money
.
the
old
man
had
taught
the
boy
to
fish
and
the
boy
loved
him
.
no
the
old
man
said
.
youre
with
a
lucky
boat
.
stay
with
them
.
but
remember
how
you
went
eightyseven
days
without
fish
and
then
we
caught
big
ones
every
day
for
three
weeks
.
i
remember
the
old
man
said
.
i
know
you
did
not
leave
me
because
you
doubted
.
it
was
papa
made
me
leave
.
i
am
a
boy
and
i
must
obey
him
.
i
know
the
old
man
said
.
it
is
quite
normal
.
he
hasnt
much
faith
.
no
the
old
man
said
.
but
we
have
.
havent
we
yes
the
boy
said
.
can
i
offer
you
a
beer
on
the
terrace
and
then
well
take
the
stuff
home
.
why
not
the
old
man
said
.
between
fishermen
.
they
sat
on
the
terrace
and
many
of
the
fishermen
made
fun
of
the
old
man
and
he
was
not
angry
.
others
of
the
older
fishermen
looked
at
him
and
were
sad
.
but
they
did
not
show
it
and
they
spoke
politely
about
the
current
and
the
depths
they
had
drifted
their
lines
at
and
the
steady
good
weather
and
of
what
they
had
seen
.
the
successful
fishermen
of
that
day
were
already
in
and
had
butchered
their
marlin
out
and
carried
them
laid
full
length
across
two
planks
with
two
men
staggering
at
the
end
of
each
plank
to
the
fish
house
where
they
waited
for
the
ice
truck
to
carry
them
to
the
market
in
havana
.
those
who
had
caught
sharks
had
taken
them
to
the
shark
factory
on
the
other
side
of
the
cove
where
they
were
hoisted
on
a
block
and
tackle
their
livers
removed
their
fins
cut
off
and
their
hides
skinned
out
and
their
flesh
cut
into
strips
for
salting
.
when
the
wind
was
in
the
east
a
smell
came
across
the
harbour
from
the
shark
factory
but
today
there
was
only
the
faint
edge
of
the
odour
because
the
wind
had
backed
into
the
north
and
then
dropped
off
and
it
was
pleasant
and
sunny
on
the
terrace
.
santiago
the
boy
said
.
yes
the
old
man
said
.
he
was
holding
his
glass
and
thinking
of
many
years
ago
.
can
i
go
out
to
get
sardines
for
you
for
tomorrow
no
.
go
and
play
baseball
.
i
can
still
row
and
rogelio
will
throw
the
net
.
i
would
like
to
go
.
if
i
cannot
fish
with
you
.
i
would
like
to
serve
in
some
way
.
you
bought
me
a
beer
the
old
man
said
.
you
are
already
a
man
.
how
old
was
i
when
you
first
took
me
in
a
boat
five
and
you
nearly
were
killed
when
i
brought
the
fish
in
too
green
and
he
nearly
tore
the
boat
to
pieces
.
can
you
remember
i
can
remember
the
tail
slapping
and
banging
and
the
thwart
breaking
and
the
noise
of
the
clubbing
.
i
can
remember
you
throwing
me
into
the
bow
where
the
wet
coiled
lines
were
and
feeling
the
whole
boat
shiver
and
the
noise
of
you
clubbing
him
like
chopping
a
tree
down
and
the
sweet
blood
smell
all
over
me
.
can
you
really
remember
that
or
did
i
just
tell
it
to
you
i
remember
everything
from
when
we
first
went
together
.
the
old
man
looked
at
him
with
his
sunburned
confident
loving
eyes
.
if
you
were
my
boy
id
take
you
out
and
gamble
he
said
.
but
you
are
your
fathers
and
your
mothers
and
you
are
in
a
lucky
boat
.
may
i
get
the
sardines
i
know
where
i
can
get
four
baits
too
.
i
have
mine
left
from
today
.
i
put
them
in
salt
in
the
box
.
let
me
get
four
fresh
ones
.
one
the
old
man
said
.
his
hope
and
his
confidence
had
never
gone
.
but
now
they
were
freshening
as
when
the
breeze
rises
.
two
the
boy
said
.
two
the
old
man
agreed
.
you
didnt
steal
them
i
would
the
boy
said
.
but
i
bought
these
.
thank
you
the
old
man
said
.
he
was
too
simple
to
wonder
when
he
had
attained
humility
.
but
he
knew
he
had
attained
it
and
he
knew
it
was
not
disgraceful
and
it
carried
no
loss
of
true
pride
.
tomorrow
is
going
to
be
a
good
day
with
this
current
he
said
.
where
are
you
going
the
boy
asked
.
far
out
to
come
in
when
the
wind
shifts
.
i
want
to
be
out
before
it
is
light
.
ill
try
to
get
him
to
work
far
out
the
boy
said
.
then
if
you
hook
something
truly
big
we
can
come
to
your
aid
.
he
does
not
like
to
work
too
far
out
.
no
the
boy
said
.
but
i
will
see
something
that
he
cannot
see
such
as
a
bird
working
and
get
him
to
come
out
after
dolphin
.
are
his
eyes
that
bad
he
is
almost
blind
.
it
is
strange
the
old
man
said
.
he
never
went
turtleing
.
that
is
what
kills
the
eyes
.
but
you
went
turtleing
for
years
off
the
mosquito
coast
and
your
eyes
are
good
.
i
am
a
strange
old
man
but
are
you
strong
enough
now
for
a
truly
big
fish
i
think
so
.
and
there
are
many
tricks
.
let
us
take
the
stuff
home
the
boy
said
.
so
i
can
get
the
cast
net
and
go
after
the
sardines
.
they
picked
up
the
gear
from
the
boat
.
the
old
man
carried
the
mast
on
his
shoulder
and
the
boy
carried
the
wooden
boat
with
the
coiled
hardbraided
brown
lines
the
gaff
and
the
harpoon
with
its
shaft
.
the
box
with
the
baits
was
under
the
stern
of
the
skiff
along
with
the
club
that
was
used
to
subdue
the
big
fish
when
they
were
brought
alongside
.
no
one
would
steal
from
the
old
man
but
it
was
better
to
take
the
sail
and
the
heavy
lines
home
as
the
dew
was
bad
for
them
and
though
he
was
quite
sure
no
local
people
would
steal
from
him
the
old
man
thought
that
a
gaff
and
a
harpoon
were
needless
temptations
to
leave
in
a
boat
.
they
walked
up
the
road
together
to
the
old
mans
shack
and
went
in
through
its
open
door
.
the
old
man
leaned
the
mast
with
its
wrapped
sail
against
the
wall
and
the
boy
put
the
box
and
the
other
gear
beside
it
.
the
mast
was
nearly
as
long
as
the
one
room
of
the
shack
.
the
shack
was
made
of
the
tough
budshields
of
the
royal
palm
which
are
called
guano
and
in
it
there
was
a
bed
a
table
one
chair
and
a
place
on
the
dirt
floor
to
cook
with
charcoal
.
on
the
brown
walls
of
the
flattened
overlapping
leaves
of
the
sturdy
fibered
guano
there
was
a
picture
in
color
of
the
sacred
heart
of
jesus
and
another
of
the
virgin
of
cobre
.
these
were
relics
of
his
wife
.
once
there
had
been
a
tinted
photograph
of
his
wife
on
the
wall
but
he
had
taken
it
down
because
it
made
him
too
lonely
to
see
it
and
it
was
on
the
shelf
in
the
corner
under
his
clean
shirt
.
what
do
you
have
to
eat
the
boy
asked
.
a
pot
of
yellow
rice
with
fish
.
do
you
want
some
no
.
i
will
eat
at
home
.
do
you
want
me
to
make
the
fire
no
.
i
will
make
it
later
on
.
or
i
may
eat
the
rice
cold
.
may
i
take
the
cast
net
of
course
.
there
was
no
cast
net
and
the
boy
remembered
when
they
had
sold
it
.
but
they
went
through
this
fiction
every
day
.
there
was
no
pot
of
yellow
rice
and
fish
and
the
boy
knew
this
too
.
eightyfive
is
a
lucky
number
the
old
man
said
.
how
would
you
like
to
see
me
bring
one
in
that
dressed
out
over
a
thousand
pounds
ill
get
the
cast
net
and
go
for
sardines
.
will
you
sit
in
the
sun
in
the
doorway
yes
.
i
have
yesterdays
paper
and
i
will
read
the
baseball
.
the
boy
did
not
know
whether
yesterdays
paper
was
a
fiction
too
.
but
the
old
man
brought
it
out
from
under
the
bed
.
perico
gave
it
to
me
at
the
bodega
he
explained
.
ill
be
back
when
i
have
the
sardines
.
ill
keep
yours
and
mine
together
on
ice
and
we
can
share
them
in
the
morning
.
when
i
come
back
you
can
tell
me
about
the
baseball
.
the
yankees
cannot
lose
.
but
i
fear
the
indians
of
cleveland
.
have
faith
in
the
yankees
my
son
.
think
of
the
great
dimaggio
.
i
fear
both
the
tigers
of
detroit
and
the
indians
of
cleveland
.
be
careful
or
you
will
fear
even
the
reds
of
cincinnati
and
the
white
sax
of
chicago
.
you
study
it
and
tell
me
when
i
come
back
.
do
you
think
we
should
buy
a
terminal
of
the
lottery
with
an
eightyfive
tomorrow
is
the
eightyfifth
day
.
we
can
do
that
the
boy
said
.
but
what
about
the
eightyseven
of
your
great
record
it
could
not
happen
twice
.
do
you
think
you
can
find
an
eightyfive
i
can
order
one
.
one
sheet
.
thats
two
dollars
and
a
half
.
who
can
we
borrow
that
from
thats
easy
.
i
can
always
borrow
two
dollars
and
a
half
.
i
think
perhaps
i
can
too
.
but
i
try
not
to
borrow
.
first
you
borrow
.
then
you
beg
.
keep
warm
old
man
the
boy
said
.
remember
we
are
in
september
.
the
month
when
the
great
fish
come
the
old
man
said
.
anyone
can
be
a
fisherman
in
may
.
i
go
now
for
the
sardines
the
boy
said
.
when
the
boy
came
back
the
old
man
was
asleep
in
the
chair
and
the
sun
was
down
.
the
boy
took
the
old
army
blanket
off
the
bed
and
spread
it
over
the
back
of
the
chair
and
over
the
old
mans
shoulders
.
they
were
strange
shoulders
still
powerful
although
very
old
and
the
neck
was
still
strong
too
and
the
creases
did
not
show
so
much
when
the
old
man
was
asleep
and
his
head
fallen
forward
.
his
shirt
had
been
patched
so
many
times
that
it
was
like
the
sail
and
the
patches
were
faded
to
many
different
shades
by
the
sun
.
the
old
mans
head
was
very
old
though
and
with
his
eyes
closed
there
was
no
life
in
his
face
.
the
newspaper
lay
across
his
knees
and
the
weight
of
his
arm
held
it
there
in
the
evening
breeze
.
he
was
barefooted
.
the
boy
left
him
there
and
when
he
came
back
the
old
man
was
still
asleep
.
wake
up
old
man
the
boy
said
and
put
his
hand
on
one
of
the
old
mans
knees
.
the
old
man
opened
his
eyes
and
for
a
moment
he
was
coming
back
from
a
long
way
away
.
then
he
smiled
.
what
have
you
got
he
asked
.
supper
said
the
boy
.
were
going
to
have
supper
.
im
not
very
hungry
.
come
on
and
eat
.
you
cant
fish
and
not
eat
.
i
have
the
old
man
said
getting
up
and
taking
the
newspaper
and
folding
it
.
then
he
started
to
fold
the
blanket
.
keep
the
blanket
around
you
the
boy
said
.
youll
not
fish
without
eating
while
im
alive
.
then
live
a
long
time
and
take
care
of
yourself
the
old
man
said
.
what
are
we
eating
black
beans
and
rice
fried
bananas
and
some
stew
.
the
boy
had
brought
them
in
a
twodecker
metal
container
from
the
terrace
.
the
two
sets
of
knives
and
forks
and
spoons
were
in
his
pocket
with
a
paper
napkin
wrapped
around
each
set
.
who
gave
this
to
you
martin
.
the
owner
.
i
must
thank
him
.
i
thanked
him
already
the
boy
said
.
you
dont
need
to
thank
him
.
ill
give
him
the
belly
meat
of
a
big
fish
the
old
man
said
.
has
he
done
this
for
us
more
than
once
i
think
so
.
i
must
give
him
something
more
than
the
belly
meat
then
.
he
is
very
thoughtful
for
us
.
he
sent
two
beers
.
i
like
the
beer
in
cans
best
.
i
know
.
but
this
is
in
bottles
hatuey
beer
and
i
take
back
the
bottles
.
thats
very
kind
of
you
the
old
man
said
.
should
we
eat
ive
been
asking
you
to
the
boy
told
him
gently
.
i
have
not
wished
to
open
the
container
until
you
were
ready
.
im
ready
now
the
old
man
said
.
i
only
needed
time
to
wash
.
where
did
you
wash
the
boy
thought
.
the
village
water
supply
was
two
streets
down
the
road
.
i
must
have
water
here
for
him
the
boy
thought
and
soap
and
a
good
towel
.
why
am
i
so
thoughtless
i
must
get
him
another
shirt
and
a
jacket
for
the
winter
and
some
sort
of
shoes
and
another
blanket
.
your
stew
is
excellent
the
old
man
said
.
tell
me
about
the
baseball
the
boy
asked
him
.
in
the
american
league
it
is
the
yankees
as
i
said
the
old
man
said
happily
.
they
lost
today
the
boy
told
him
.
that
means
nothing
.
the
great
dimaggio
is
himself
again
.
they
have
other
men
on
the
team
.
naturally
.
but
he
makes
the
difference
.
in
the
other
league
between
brooklyn
and
philadelphia
i
must
take
brooklyn
.
but
then
i
think
of
dick
sisler
and
those
great
drives
in
the
old
park
.
there
was
nothing
ever
like
them
.
he
hits
the
longest
ball
i
have
ever
seen
.
do
you
remember
when
he
used
to
come
to
the
terrace
i
wanted
to
take
him
fishing
but
i
was
too
timid
to
ask
him
.
then
i
asked
you
to
ask
him
and
you
were
too
timid
.
i
know
.
it
was
a
great
mistake
.
he
might
have
gone
with
us
.
then
we
would
have
that
for
all
of
our
lives
.
i
would
like
to
take
the
great
dimaggio
fishing
the
old
man
said
.
they
say
his
father
was
a
fisherman
.
maybe
he
was
as
poor
as
we
are
and
would
understand
.
the
great
sislers
father
was
never
poor
and
he
the
father
was
playing
in
the
big
leagues
when
he
was
my
age
.
when
i
was
your
age
i
was
before
the
mast
on
a
square
rigged
ship
that
ran
to
africa
and
i
have
seen
lions
on
the
beaches
in
the
evening
.
i
know
.
you
told
me
.
should
we
talk
about
africa
or
about
baseball
baseball
i
think
the
boy
said
.
tell
me
about
the
great
john
j
.
mcgraw
.
he
said
jota
for
j
.
he
used
to
come
to
the
terrace
sometimes
too
in
the
older
days
.
but
he
was
rough
and
harshspoken
and
difficult
when
he
was
drinking
.
his
mind
was
on
horses
as
well
as
baseball
.
at
least
he
carried
lists
of
horses
at
all
times
in
his
pocket
and
frequently
spoke
the
names
of
horses
on
the
telephone
.
he
was
a
great
manager
the
boy
said
.
my
father
thinks
he
was
the
greatest
.
because
he
came
here
the
most
times
the
old
man
said
.
if
durocher
had
continued
to
come
here
each
year
your
father
would
think
him
the
greatest
manager
.
who
is
the
greatest
manager
really
luque
or
mike
gonzalez
i
think
they
are
equal
.
and
the
best
fisherman
is
you
.
no
.
i
know
others
better
.
que
va
the
boy
said
.
there
are
many
good
fishermen
and
some
great
ones
.
but
there
is
only
you
.
thank
you
.
you
make
me
happy
.
i
hope
no
fish
will
come
along
so
great
that
he
will
prove
us
wrong
.
there
is
no
such
fish
if
you
are
still
strong
as
you
say
.
i
may
not
be
as
strong
as
i
think
the
old
man
said
.
but
i
know
many
tricks
and
i
have
resolution
.
you
ought
to
go
to
bed
now
so
that
you
will
be
fresh
in
the
morning
.
i
will
take
the
things
back
to
the
terrace
.
good
night
then
.
i
will
wake
you
in
the
morning
.
youre
my
alarm
clock
the
boy
said
.
age
is
my
alarm
clock
the
old
man
said
.
why
do
old
men
wake
so
early
is
it
to
have
one
longer
day
i
dont
know
the
boy
said
.
all
i
know
is
that
young
boys
sleep
late
and
hard
.
i
can
remember
it
the
old
man
said
.
ill
waken
you
in
time
.
i
do
not
like
for
him
to
waken
me
.
it
is
as
though
i
were
inferior
.
i
know
.
sleep
well
old
man
.
the
boy
went
out
.
they
had
eaten
with
no
light
on
the
table
and
the
old
man
took
off
his
trousers
and
went
to
bed
in
the
dark
.
he
rolled
his
trousers
up
to
make
a
pillow
putting
the
newspaper
inside
them
.
he
rolled
himself
in
the
blanket
and
slept
on
the
other
old
newspapers
that
covered
the
springs
of
the
bed
.
he
was
asleep
in
a
short
time
and
he
dreamed
of
africa
when
he
was
a
boy
and
the
long
golden
beaches
and
the
white
beaches
so
white
they
hurt
your
eyes
and
the
high
capes
and
the
great
brown
mountains
.
he
lived
along
that
coast
now
every
night
and
in
his
dreams
he
heard
the
surf
roar
and
saw
the
native
boats
come
riding
through
it
.
he
smelled
the
tar
and
oakum
of
the
deck
as
he
slept
and
he
smelled
the
smell
of
africa
that
the
land
breeze
brought
at
morning
.
usually
when
he
smelled
the
land
breeze
he
woke
up
and
dressed
to
go
and
wake
the
boy
.
but
tonight
the
smell
of
the
land
breeze
came
very
early
and
he
knew
it
was
too
early
in
his
dream
and
went
on
dreaming
to
see
the
white
peaks
of
the
islands
rising
from
the
sea
and
then
he
dreamed
of
the
different
harbours
and
roadsteads
of
the
canary
islands
.
he
no
longer
dreamed
of
storms
nor
of
women
nor
of
great
occurrences
nor
of
great
fish
nor
fights
nor
contests
of
strength
nor
of
his
wife
.
he
only
dreamed
of
places
now
and
of
the
lions
on
the
beach
.
they
played
like
young
cats
in
the
dusk
and
he
loved
them
as
he
loved
the
boy
.
he
never
dreamed
about
the
boy
.
he
simply
woke
looked
out
the
open
door
at
the
moon
and
unrolled
his
trousers
and
put
them
on
.
he
urinated
outside
the
shack
and
then
went
up
the
road
to
wake
the
boy
.
he
was
shivering
with
the
morning
cold
.
but
he
knew
he
would
shiver
himself
warm
and
that
soon
he
would
be
rowing
.
the
door
of
the
house
where
the
boy
lived
was
unlocked
and
he
opened
it
and
walked
in
quietly
with
his
bare
feet
.
the
boy
was
asleep
on
a
cot
in
the
first
room
and
the
old
man
could
see
him
clearly
with
the
light
that
came
in
from
the
dying
moon
.
he
took
hold
of
one
foot
gently
and
held
it
until
the
boy
woke
and
turned
and
looked
at
him
.
the
old
man
nodded
and
the
boy
took
his
trousers
from
the
chair
by
the
bed
and
sitting
on
the
bed
pulled
them
on
.
the
old
man
went
out
the
door
and
the
boy
came
after
him
.
he
was
sleepy
and
the
old
man
put
his
arm
across
his
shoulders
and
said
i
am
sorry
.
qua
va
the
boy
said
.
it
is
what
a
man
must
do
.
they
walked
down
the
road
to
the
old
mans
shack
and
all
along
the
road
in
the
dark
barefoot
men
were
moving
carrying
the
masts
of
their
boats
.
when
they
reached
the
old
mans
shack
the
boy
took
the
rolls
of
line
in
the
basket
and
the
harpoon
and
gaff
and
the
old
man
carried
the
mast
with
the
furled
sail
on
his
shoulder
.
do
you
want
coffee
the
boy
asked
.
well
put
the
gear
in
the
boat
and
then
get
some
.
they
had
coffee
from
condensed
milk
cans
at
an
early
morning
place
that
served
fishermen
.
how
did
you
sleep
old
man
the
boy
asked
.
he
was
waking
up
now
although
it
was
still
hard
for
him
to
leave
his
sleep
.
very
well
manolin
the
old
man
said
.
i
feel
confident
today
.
so
do
i
the
boy
said
.
now
i
must
get
your
sardines
and
mine
and
your
fresh
baits
.
he
brings
our
gear
himself
.
he
never
wants
anyone
to
carry
anything
.
were
different
the
old
man
said
.
i
let
you
carry
things
when
you
were
five
years
old
.
i
know
it
the
boy
said
.
ill
be
right
back
.
have
another
coffee
.
we
have
credit
here
.
he
walked
off
barefooted
on
the
coral
rocks
to
the
ice
house
where
the
baits
were
stored
.
the
old
man
drank
his
coffee
slowly
.
it
was
all
he
would
have
all
day
and
he
knew
that
he
should
take
it
.
for
a
long
time
now
eating
had
bored
him
and
he
never
carried
a
lunch
.
he
had
a
bottle
of
water
in
the
bow
of
the
skiff
and
that
was
all
he
needed
for
the
day
.
the
boy
was
back
now
with
the
sardines
and
the
two
baits
wrapped
in
a
newspaper
and
they
went
down
the
trail
to
the
skiff
feeling
the
pebbled
sand
under
their
feet
and
lifted
the
skiff
and
slid
her
into
the
water
.
good
luck
old
man
.
good
luck
the
old
man
said
.
he
fitted
the
rope
lashings
of
the
oars
onto
the
thole
pins
and
leaning
forward
against
the
thrust
of
the
blades
in
the
water
he
began
to
row
out
of
the
harbour
in
the
dark
.
there
were
other
boats
from
the
other
beaches
going
out
to
sea
and
the
old
man
heard
the
dip
and
push
of
their
oars
even
though
he
could
not
see
them
now
the
moon
was
below
the
hills
.
sometimes
someone
would
speak
in
a
boat
.
but
most
of
the
boats
were
silent
except
for
the
dip
of
the
oars
.
they
spread
apart
after
they
were
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
and
each
one
headed
for
the
part
of
the
ocean
where
he
hoped
to
find
fish
.
the
old
man
knew
he
was
going
far
out
and
he
left
the
smell
of
the
land
behind
and
rowed
out
into
the
clean
early
morning
smell
of
the
ocean
.
he
saw
the
phosphorescence
of
the
gulf
weed
in
the
water
as
he
rowed
over
the
part
of
the
ocean
that
the
fishermen
called
the
great
well
because
there
was
a
sudden
deep
of
seven
hundred
fathoms
where
all
sorts
of
fish
congregated
because
of
the
swirl
the
current
made
against
the
steep
walls
of
the
floor
of
the
ocean
.
here
there
were
concentrations
of
shrimp
and
bait
fish
and
sometimes
schools
of
squid
in
the
deepest
holes
and
these
rose
close
to
the
surface
at
night
where
all
the
wandering
fish
fed
on
them
.
in
the
dark
the
old
man
could
feel
the
morning
coming
and
as
he
rowed
he
heard
the
trembling
sound
as
flying
fish
left
the
water
and
the
hissing
that
their
stiff
set
wings
made
as
they
soared
away
in
the
darkness
.
he
was
very
fond
of
flying
fish
as
they
were
his
principal
friends
on
the
ocean
.
he
was
sorry
for
the
birds
especially
the
small
delicate
dark
terns
that
were
always
flying
and
looking
and
almost
never
finding
and
he
thought
the
birds
have
a
harder
life
than
we
do
except
for
the
robber
birds
and
the
heavy
strong
ones
.
why
did
they
make
birds
so
delicate
and
fine
as
those
sea
swallows
when
the
ocean
can
be
so
cruel
she
is
kind
and
very
beautiful
.
but
she
can
be
so
cruel
and
it
comes
so
suddenly
and
such
birds
that
fly
dipping
and
hunting
with
their
small
sad
voices
are
made
too
delicately
for
the
sea
.
he
always
thought
of
the
sea
as
la
mar
which
is
what
people
call
her
in
spanish
when
they
love
her
.
sometimes
those
who
love
her
say
bad
things
of
her
but
they
are
always
said
as
though
she
were
a
woman
.
some
of
the
younger
fishermen
those
who
used
buoys
as
floats
for
their
lines
and
had
motorboats
bought
when
the
shark
livers
had
brought
much
money
spoke
of
her
as
el
mar
which
is
masculine
.
they
spoke
of
her
as
a
contestant
or
a
place
or
even
an
enemy
.
but
the
old
man
always
thought
of
her
as
feminine
and
as
something
that
gave
or
withheld
great
favours
and
if
she
did
wild
or
wicked
things
it
was
because
she
could
not
help
them
.
the
moon
affects
her
as
it
does
a
woman
he
thought
.
he
was
rowing
steadily
and
it
was
no
effort
for
him
since
he
kept
well
within
his
speed
and
the
surface
of
the
ocean
was
flat
except
for
the
occasional
swirls
of
the
current
.
he
was
letting
the
current
do
a
third
of
the
work
and
as
it
started
to
be
light
he
saw
he
was
already
further
out
than
he
had
hoped
to
be
at
this
hour
.
i
worked
the
deep
wells
for
a
week
and
did
nothing
he
thought
.
today
ill
work
out
where
the
schools
of
bonito
and
albacore
are
and
maybe
there
will
be
a
big
one
with
them
.
before
it
was
really
light
he
had
his
baits
out
and
was
drifting
with
the
current
.
one
bait
was
down
forty
fathoms
.
the
second
was
at
seventyfive
and
the
third
and
fourth
were
down
in
the
blue
water
at
one
hundred
and
one
hundred
and
twentyfive
fathoms
.
each
bait
hung
head
down
with
the
shank
of
the
hook
inside
the
bait
fish
tied
and
sewed
solid
and
all
the
projecting
part
of
the
hook
the
curve
and
the
point
was
covered
with
fresh
sardines
.
each
sardine
was
hooked
through
both
eyes
so
that
they
made
a
halfgarland
on
the
projecting
steel
.
there
was
no
part
of
the
hook
that
a
great
fish
could
feel
which
was
not
sweet
smelling
and
good
tasting
.
the
boy
had
given
him
two
fresh
small
tunas
or
albacores
which
hung
on
the
two
deepest
lines
like
plummets
and
on
the
others
he
had
a
big
blue
runner
and
a
yellow
jack
that
had
been
used
before
but
they
were
in
good
condition
still
and
had
the
excellent
sardines
to
give
them
scent
and
attractiveness
.
each
line
as
thick
around
as
a
big
pencil
was
looped
onto
a
greensapped
stick
so
that
any
pull
or
touch
on
the
bait
would
make
the
stick
dip
and
each
line
had
two
fortyfathom
coils
which
could
be
made
fast
to
the
other
spare
coils
so
that
if
it
were
necessary
a
fish
could
take
out
over
three
hundred
fathoms
of
line
.
now
the
man
watched
the
dip
of
the
three
sticks
over
the
side
of
the
skiff
and
rowed
gently
to
keep
the
lines
straight
up
and
down
and
at
their
proper
depths
.
it
was
quite
light
and
any
moment
now
the
sun
would
rise
.
the
sun
rose
thinly
from
the
sea
and
the
old
man
could
see
the
other
boats
low
on
the
water
and
well
in
toward
the
shore
spread
out
across
the
current
.
then
the
sun
was
brighter
and
the
glare
came
on
the
water
and
then
as
it
rose
clear
the
flat
sea
sent
it
back
at
his
eyes
so
that
it
hurt
sharply
and
he
rowed
without
looking
into
it
.
he
looked
down
into
the
water
and
watched
the
lines
that
went
straight
down
into
the
dark
of
the
water
.
he
kept
them
straighter
than
anyone
did
so
that
at
each
level
in
the
darkness
of
the
stream
there
would
be
a
bait
waiting
exactly
where
he
wished
it
to
be
for
any
fish
that
swam
there
.
others
let
them
drift
with
the
current
and
sometimes
they
were
at
sixty
fathoms
when
the
fishermen
thought
they
were
at
a
hundred
.
but
he
thought
i
keep
them
with
precision
.
only
i
have
no
luck
any
more
.
but
who
knows
maybe
today
.
every
day
is
a
new
day
.
it
is
better
to
be
lucky
.
but
i
would
rather
be
exact
.
then
when
luck
comes
you
are
ready
.
the
sun
was
two
hours
higher
now
and
it
did
not
hurt
his
eyes
so
much
to
look
into
the
east
.
there
were
only
three
boats
in
sight
now
and
they
showed
very
low
and
far
inshore
.
all
my
life
the
early
sun
has
hurt
my
eyes
he
thought
.
yet
they
are
still
good
.
in
the
evening
i
can
look
straight
into
it
without
getting
the
blackness
.
it
has
more
force
in
the
evening
too
.
but
in
the
morning
it
is
painful
.
just
then
he
saw
a
manofwar
bird
with
his
long
black
wings
circling
in
the
sky
ahead
of
him
.
he
made
a
quick
drop
slanting
down
on
his
backswept
wings
and
then
circled
again
.
hes
got
something
the
old
man
said
aloud
.
hes
not
just
looking
.
he
rowed
slowly
and
steadily
toward
where
the
bird
was
circling
.
he
did
not
hurry
and
he
kept
his
lines
straight
up
and
down
.
but
he
crowded
the
current
a
little
so
that
he
was
still
fishing
correctly
though
faster
than
he
would
have
fished
if
he
was
not
trying
to
use
the
bird
.
the
bird
went
higher
in
the
air
and
circled
again
his
wings
motionless
.
then
he
dove
suddenly
and
the
old
man
saw
flying
fish
spurt
out
of
the
water
and
sail
desperately
over
the
surface
.
dolphin
the
old
man
said
aloud
.
big
dolphin
.
he
shipped
his
oars
and
brought
a
small
line
from
under
the
bow
.
it
had
a
wire
leader
and
a
mediumsized
hook
and
he
baited
it
with
one
of
the
sardines
.
he
let
it
go
over
the
side
and
then
made
it
fast
to
a
ring
bolt
in
the
stern
.
then
he
baited
another
line
and
left
it
coiled
in
the
shade
of
the
bow
.
he
went
back
to
rowing
and
to
watching
the
longwinged
black
bird
who
was
working
now
low
over
the
water
.
as
he
watched
the
bird
dipped
again
slanting
his
wings
for
the
dive
and
then
swinging
them
wildly
and
ineffectually
as
he
followed
the
flying
fish
.
the
old
man
could
see
the
slight
bulge
in
the
water
that
the
big
dolphin
raised
as
they
followed
the
escaping
fish
.
the
dolphin
were
cutting
through
the
water
below
the
flight
of
the
fish
and
would
be
in
the
water
driving
at
speed
when
the
fish
dropped
.
it
is
a
big
school
of
dolphin
he
thought
.
they
are
widespread
and
the
flying
fish
have
little
chance
.
the
bird
has
no
chance
.
the
flying
fish
are
too
big
for
him
and
they
go
too
fast
.
he
watched
the
flying
fish
burst
out
again
and
again
and
the
ineffectual
movements
of
the
bird
.
that
school
has
gotten
away
from
me
he
thought
.
they
are
moving
out
too
fast
and
too
far
.
but
perhaps
i
will
pick
up
a
stray
and
perhaps
my
big
fish
is
around
them
.
my
big
fish
must
be
somewhere
.
the
clouds
over
the
land
now
rose
like
mountains
and
the
coast
was
only
a
long
green
line
with
the
gray
blue
hills
behind
it
.
the
water
was
a
dark
blue
now
so
dark
that
it
was
almost
purple
.
as
he
looked
down
into
it
he
saw
the
red
sifting
of
the
plankton
in
the
dark
water
and
the
strange
light
the
sun
made
now
.
he
watched
his
lines
to
see
them
go
straight
down
out
of
sight
into
the
water
and
he
was
happy
to
see
so
much
plankton
because
it
meant
fish
.
the
strange
light
the
sun
made
in
the
water
now
that
the
sun
was
higher
meant
good
weather
and
so
did
the
shape
of
the
clouds
over
the
land
.
but
the
bird
was
almost
out
of
sight
now
and
nothing
showed
on
the
surface
of
the
water
but
some
patches
of
yellow
sunbleached
sargasso
weed
and
the
purple
formalized
iridescent
gelatinous
bladder
of
a
portuguese
manofwar
floating
dose
beside
the
boat
.
it
turned
on
its
side
and
then
righted
itself
.
it
floated
cheerfully
as
a
bubble
with
its
long
deadly
purple
filaments
trailing
a
yard
behind
it
in
the
water
.
agua
mala
the
man
said
.
you
whore
.
from
where
he
swung
lightly
against
his
oars
he
looked
down
into
the
water
and
saw
the
tiny
fish
that
were
coloured
like
the
trailing
filaments
and
swam
between
them
and
under
the
small
shade
the
bubble
made
as
it
drifted
.
they
were
immune
to
its
poison
.
but
men
were
not
and
when
same
of
the
filaments
would
catch
on
a
line
and
rest
there
slimy
and
purple
while
the
old
man
was
working
a
fish
he
would
have
welts
and
sores
on
his
arms
and
hands
of
the
sort
that
poison
ivy
or
poison
oak
can
give
.
but
these
poisonings
from
the
agua
mala
came
quickly
and
struck
like
a
whiplash
.
the
iridescent
bubbles
were
beautiful
.
but
they
were
the
falsest
thing
in
the
sea
and
the
old
man
loved
to
see
the
big
sea
turtles
eating
them
.
the
turtles
saw
them
approached
them
from
the
front
then
shut
their
eyes
so
they
were
completely
carapaced
and
ate
them
filaments
and
all
.
the
old
man
loved
to
see
the
turtles
eat
them
and
he
loved
to
walk
on
them
on
the
beach
after
a
storm
and
hear
them
pop
when
he
stepped
on
them
with
the
horny
soles
of
his
feet
.
he
loved
green
turtles
and
hawkbills
with
their
elegance
and
speed
and
their
great
value
and
he
had
a
friendly
contempt
for
the
huge
stupid
loggerheads
yellow
in
their
armourplating
strange
in
their
lovemaking
and
happily
eating
the
portuguese
menofwar
with
their
eyes
shut
.
he
had
no
mysticism
about
turtles
although
he
had
gone
in
turtle
boats
for
many
years
.
he
was
sorry
for
them
all
even
the
great
trunk
backs
that
were
as
long
as
the
skiff
and
weighed
a
ton
.
most
people
are
heartless
about
turtles
because
a
turtles
heart
will
beat
for
hours
after
he
has
been
cut
up
and
butchered
.
but
the
old
man
thought
i
have
such
a
heart
too
and
my
feet
and
hands
are
like
theirs
.
he
ate
the
white
eggs
to
give
himself
strength
.
he
ate
them
all
through
may
to
be
strong
in
september
and
october
for
the
truly
big
fish
.
he
also
drank
a
cup
of
shark
liver
oil
each
day
from
the
big
drum
in
the
shack
where
many
of
the
fishermen
kept
their
gear
.
it
was
there
for
all
fishermen
who
wanted
it
.
most
fishermen
hated
the
taste
.
but
it
was
no
worse
than
getting
up
at
the
hours
that
they
rose
and
it
was
very
good
against
all
colds
and
grippes
and
it
was
good
for
the
eyes
.
now
the
old
man
looked
up
and
saw
that
the
bird
was
circling
again
.
hes
found
fish
he
said
aloud
then
the
line
would
not
come
in
any
more
and
he
held
it
until
he
saw
the
drops
jumping
from
it
in
the
sun
.
then
it
started
out
and
the
old
man
knelt
down
and
let
it
go
grudgingly
back
into
the
dark
water
.
he
is
making
the
far
part
of
his
circle
now
he
said
.
i
must
hold
all
i
can
he
thought
.
the
strain
will
shorten
his
circle
each
time
.
perhaps
in
an
hour
i
will
see
him
.
now
i
must
convince
him
and
then
i
must
kill
him
.
but
the
fish
kept
on
circling
slowly
and
the
old
man
was
wet
with
sweat
and
tired
deep
into
his
bones
two
hours
later
.
but
the
circles
were
much
shorter
now
and
from
the
way
the
line
slanted
he
could
tell
the
fish
had
risen
steadily
while
he
swam
.
for
an
hour
the
old
man
had
been
seeing
black
spots
before
his
eyes
and
the
sweat
salted
his
eyes
and
salted
the
cut
over
his
eye
and
on
his
forehead
.
he
was
not
afraid
of
the
black
spots
.
they
were
normal
at
the
tension
that
he
was
pulling
on
the
line
.
twice
though
he
had
felt
faint
and
dizzy
and
that
had
worried
him
.
i
could
not
fail
myself
and
die
on
a
fish
like
this
he
said
.
now
that
i
have
him
coming
so
beautifully
god
help
me
endure
.
ill
say
a
hundred
our
fathers
and
a
hundred
hail
marys
.
but
i
cannot
say
them
now
.
consider
them
said
he
thought
.
ill
say
them
later
.
just
then
he
felt
a
sudden
banging
and
jerking
on
the
line
he
held
with
his
two
hands
.
it
was
sharp
and
hardfeeling
and
heavy
.
he
is
hitting
the
wire
leader
with
his
spear
he
thought
.
that
was
bound
to
come
.
he
had
to
do
that
.
it
may
make
him
jump
though
and
i
would
rather
he
stayed
circling
now
.
the
jumps
were
necessary
for
him
to
take
air
.
but
after
that
each
one
can
widen
the
opening
of
the
hook
wound
and
he
can
throw
the
hook
.
dont
jump
fish
he
said
.
dont
jump
.
the
fish
hit
the
wire
several
times
more
and
each
time
he
shook
his
head
the
old
man
gave
up
a
little
line
.
i
must
hold
his
pain
where
it
is
he
thought
.
mine
does
not
matter
.
i
can
control
mine
.
but
his
pain
could
drive
him
mad
.
after
a
while
the
fish
stopped
beating
at
the
wire
and
started
circling
slowly
again
.
the
old
man
was
gaining
line
steadily
now
.
but
he
felt
faint
again
.
he
lifted
some
sea
water
with
his
left
hand
and
put
it
on
his
head
.
then
he
put
more
on
and
rubbed
the
back
of
his
neck
.
i
have
no
cramps
he
said
.
hell
be
up
soon
and
i
can
last
.
you
have
to
last
.
dont
even
speak
of
it
.
he
kneeled
against
the
bow
and
for
a
moment
slipped
the
line
over
his
back
again
.
ill
rest
now
while
he
goes
out
on
the
circle
and
then
stand
up
and
work
on
him
when
he
comes
in
he
decided
.
it
was
a
great
temptation
to
rest
in
the
bow
and
let
the
fish
make
one
circle
by
himself
without
recovering
any
line
.
but
when
the
strain
showed
the
fish
had
turned
to
come
toward
the
boat
the
old
man
rose
to
his
feet
and
started
the
pivoting
and
the
weaving
pulling
that
brought
in
all
the
line
he
gained
.
im
tireder
than
i
have
ever
been
he
thought
and
now
the
trade
wind
is
rising
.
but
that
will
be
good
to
take
him
in
with
.
i
need
that
badly
.
ill
rest
on
the
next
turn
as
he
goes
out
he
said
.
i
feel
much
better
.
then
in
two
or
three
turns
more
i
will
have
him
.
his
straw
hat
was
far
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
he
sank
down
into
the
bow
with
the
pull
of
the
line
as
he
felt
the
fish
turn
.
you
work
now
fish
he
thought
.
ill
take
you
at
the
turn
.
the
sea
had
risen
considerably
.
but
it
was
a
fairweather
breeze
and
he
had
to
have
it
to
get
home
.
ill
just
steer
south
and
west
he
said
.
a
man
is
never
lost
at
sea
and
it
is
a
long
island
.
it
was
on
the
third
turn
that
he
saw
the
fish
first
.
he
saw
him
first
as
a
dark
shadow
that
took
so
long
to
pass
under
the
boat
that
he
could
not
believe
its
length
.
no
he
said
.
he
cant
be
that
big
.
but
he
was
that
big
and
at
the
end
of
this
circle
he
came
to
the
surface
only
thirty
yards
away
and
the
man
saw
his
tail
out
of
water
.
it
was
higher
than
a
big
scythe
blade
and
a
very
pale
lavender
above
the
dark
blue
water
.
it
raked
back
and
as
the
fish
swam
just
below
the
surface
the
old
man
could
see
his
huge
bulk
and
the
purple
stripes
that
banded
him
.
his
dorsal
fin
was
down
and
his
huge
pectorals
were
spread
wide
.
on
this
circle
the
old
man
could
see
the
fishs
eye
and
the
two
gray
sucking
fish
that
swain
around
him
.
sometimes
they
attached
themselves
to
him
.
sometimes
they
darted
off
.
sometimes
they
would
swim
easily
in
his
shadow
.
they
were
each
over
three
feet
long
and
when
they
swam
fast
they
lashed
their
whole
bodies
like
eels
.
the
old
man
was
sweating
now
but
from
something
else
besides
the
sun
.
on
each
calm
placid
turn
the
fish
made
he
was
gaining
line
and
he
was
sure
that
in
two
turns
more
he
would
have
a
chance
to
get
the
harpoon
in
.
but
i
must
get
him
close
close
close
he
thought
.
i
mustnt
try
for
the
head
.
i
must
get
the
heart
.
be
calm
and
strong
old
man
he
said
.
on
the
next
circle
the
fishs
beck
was
out
but
he
was
a
little
too
far
from
the
boat
.
on
the
next
circle
he
was
still
too
far
away
but
he
was
higher
out
of
water
and
the
old
man
was
sure
that
by
gaining
some
more
line
he
could
have
him
alongside
.
he
had
rigged
his
harpoon
long
before
and
its
coil
of
light
rope
was
in
a
round
basket
and
the
end
was
made
fast
to
the
bitt
in
the
bow
.
the
fish
was
coming
in
on
his
circle
now
calm
and
beautiful
looking
and
only
his
great
tail
moving
.
the
old
man
pulled
on
him
all
that
he
could
to
bring
him
closer
.
for
just
a
moment
the
fish
turned
a
little
on
his
side
.
then
he
straightened
himself
and
began
another
circle
.
i
moved
him
the
old
man
said
.
i
moved
him
then
.
he
felt
faint
again
now
but
he
held
on
the
great
fish
all
the
strain
that
he
could
.
i
moved
him
he
thought
.
maybe
this
time
i
can
get
him
over
.
pull
hands
he
thought
.
hold
up
legs
.
last
for
me
head
.
last
for
me
.
you
never
went
.
this
time
ill
pull
him
over
.
but
when
he
put
all
of
his
effort
on
starting
it
well
out
before
the
fish
came
alongside
and
pulling
with
all
his
strength
the
fish
pulled
part
way
over
and
then
righted
himself
and
swam
away
.
fish
the
old
man
said
.
fish
you
are
going
to
have
to
die
anyway
.
do
you
have
to
kill
me
too
that
way
nothing
is
accomplished
he
thought
.
his
mouth
was
too
dry
to
speak
but
he
could
not
reach
for
the
water
now
.
i
must
get
him
alongside
this
time
he
thought
.
i
am
not
good
for
many
more
turns
.
yes
you
are
he
told
himself
.
youre
good
for
ever
.
on
the
next
turn
he
nearly
had
him
.
but
again
the
fish
righted
himself
and
swam
slowly
away
.
you
are
killing
me
fish
the
old
man
thought
.
but
you
have
a
right
to
.
never
have
i
seen
a
greater
or
more
beautiful
or
a
calmer
or
more
noble
thing
than
you
brother
.
come
on
and
kill
me
.
i
do
not
care
who
kills
who
.
now
you
are
getting
confused
in
the
head
he
thought
.
you
must
keep
your
head
clear
.
keep
your
head
clear
and
know
how
to
suffer
like
a
man
.
or
a
fish
he
thought
.
clear
up
head
he
said
in
a
voice
he
could
hardly
hear
.
clear
up
.
twice
more
it
was
the
same
on
the
turns
.
i
do
not
know
the
old
man
thought
.
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
feeling
himself
go
each
time
.
i
do
not
know
.
but
i
will
try
it
once
more
.
he
tried
it
once
more
and
he
felt
himself
going
when
he
turned
the
fish
.
the
fish
righted
himself
and
swam
off
again
slowly
with
the
great
tail
weaving
in
the
air
.
ill
try
it
again
the
old
man
promised
although
his
hands
were
mushy
now
and
he
could
only
see
well
in
flashes
.
he
tried
it
again
and
it
was
the
same
.
so
he
thought
and
he
felt
himself
going
before
he
started
i
will
try
it
once
again
.
he
took
all
his
pain
and
what
was
left
of
his
strength
and
his
long
gone
pride
and
he
put
it
against
the
fishs
agony
and
the
fish
came
over
onto
his
side
and
swam
gently
on
his
side
his
bill
almost
touching
the
planking
of
the
skiff
and
started
to
pass
the
boat
long
deep
wide
silver
and
barred
with
purple
and
interminable
in
the
water
.
the
old
man
dropped
the
line
and
put
his
foot
on
it
and
lifted
the
harpoon
as
high
as
he
could
and
drove
it
down
with
all
his
strength
and
more
strength
he
had
just
summoned
into
the
fishs
side
just
behind
the
great
chest
fin
that
rose
high
in
the
air
to
the
altitude
of
the
mans
chest
.
he
felt
the
iron
go
in
and
he
leaned
on
it
and
drove
it
further
and
then
pushed
all
his
weight
after
it
.
then
the
fish
came
alive
with
his
death
in
him
and
rose
high
out
of
the
water
showing
all
his
great
length
and
width
and
all
his
power
and
his
beauty
.
he
seemed
to
hang
in
the
air
above
the
old
man
in
the
skiff
.
then
he
fell
into
the
water
with
a
crash
that
sent
spray
over
the
old
man
and
over
all
of
the
skiff
.
the
old
man
felt
faint
and
sick
and
he
could
not
see
well
.
but
he
cleared
the
harpoon
line
and
let
it
run
slowly
through
his
raw
hands
and
when
he
could
see
he
saw
the
fish
was
on
his
back
with
his
silver
belly
up
.
the
shaft
of
the
harpoon
was
projecting
at
an
angle
from
the
fishs
shoulder
and
the
sea
was
discolouring
with
the
red
of
the
blood
from
his
heart
.
first
it
was
dark
as
a
shoal
in
the
blue
water
that
was
more
than
a
mile
deep
.
then
it
spread
like
a
cloud
.
the
fish
was
silvery
and
still
and
floated
with
the
waves
.
the
old
man
looked
carefully
in
the
glimpse
of
vision
that
he
had
.
then
he
took
two
turns
of
the
harpoon
line
around
the
bitt
in
the
bow
and
hid
his
head
on
his
hands
.
keep
my
head
dear
he
said
against
the
wood
of
the
bow
.
i
am
a
tired
old
man
.
but
i
have
killed
this
fish
which
is
my
brother
and
now
i
must
do
the
slave
work
.
now
i
must
prepare
the
nooses
and
the
rope
to
lash
him
alongside
he
thought
.
even
if
we
were
two
and
swamped
her
to
load
him
and
bailed
her
out
this
skiff
would
never
hold
him
.
i
must
prepare
everything
then
bring
him
in
and
lash
him
well
and
step
the
mast
and
set
sail
for
home
.
he
started
to
pull
the
fish
in
to
have
him
alongside
so
that
he
could
pass
a
line
through
his
gills
and
out
his
mouth
and
make
his
head
fast
alongside
the
bow
.
i
want
to
see
him
he
thought
and
to
touch
and
to
feel
him
.
he
is
my
fortune
he
thought
.
but
that
is
not
why
i
wish
to
feel
him
.
i
think
i
felt
his
heart
he
thought
.
when
i
pushed
on
the
harpoon
shaft
the
second
time
.
bring
him
in
now
and
make
him
fast
and
get
the
noose
around
his
tail
and
another
around
his
middle
to
bind
him
to
the
skiff
.
get
to
work
old
man
he
said
.
he
took
a
very
small
drink
of
the
water
.
there
is
very
much
slave
work
to
be
done
now
that
the
fight
is
over
.
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
then
out
to
his
fish
.
he
looked
at
the
sun
carefully
.
it
is
not
much
more
than
noon
he
thought
.
and
the
trade
wind
is
rising
.
the
lines
all
mean
nothing
now
.
the
boy
and
i
will
splice
them
when
we
are
home
.
come
on
fish
he
said
.
but
the
fish
did
not
come
.
instead
he
lay
there
wallowing
now
in
the
seas
and
the
old
man
pulled
the
skiff
upon
to
him
.
when
he
was
even
with
him
and
had
the
fishs
head
against
the
bow
he
could
not
believe
his
size
.
but
he
untied
the
harpoon
rope
from
the
bitt
passed
it
through
the
fishs
gills
and
out
his
jaws
made
a
turn
around
his
sword
then
passed
the
rope
through
the
other
gill
made
another
turn
around
the
bill
and
knotted
the
double
rope
and
made
it
fast
to
the
bitt
in
the
bow
.
he
cut
the
rope
then
and
went
astern
to
noose
the
tail
.
the
fish
had
turned
silver
from
his
original
purple
and
silver
and
the
stripes
showed
the
same
pale
violet
colour
as
his
tail
.
they
were
wider
than
a
mans
hand
with
his
fingers
spread
and
the
fishs
eye
looked
as
detached
as
the
mirrors
in
a
periscope
or
as
a
saint
in
a
procession
.
it
was
the
only
way
to
kill
him
the
old
man
said
.
he
was
feeling
better
since
the
water
and
he
knew
he
would
not
go
away
and
his
head
was
clear
.
hes
over
fifteen
hundred
pounds
the
way
he
is
he
thought
.
maybe
much
more
.
if
he
dresses
out
twothirds
of
that
at
thirty
cents
a
pound
i
need
a
pencil
for
that
he
said
.
my
head
is
not
that
clear
.
but
i
think
the
great
dimaggio
would
be
proud
of
me
today
.
i
had
no
bone
spurs
.
but
the
hands
and
the
back
hurt
truly
.
i
wonder
what
a
bone
spur
is
he
thought
.
maybe
we
have
them
without
knowing
of
it
.
he
made
the
fish
fast
to
bow
and
stern
and
to
the
middle
thwart
.
he
was
so
big
it
was
like
lashing
a
much
bigger
skiff
alongside
.
he
cut
a
piece
of
line
and
tied
the
fishs
lower
jaw
against
his
bill
so
his
mouth
would
not
open
and
they
would
sail
as
cleanly
as
possible
.
then
he
stepped
the
mast
and
with
the
stick
that
was
his
gaff
and
with
his
boom
rigged
the
patched
sail
drew
the
boat
began
to
move
and
half
lying
in
the
stern
he
sailed
southwest
.
he
did
not
need
a
compass
to
tell
him
where
southwest
was
.
he
only
needed
the
feel
of
the
trade
wind
and
the
drawing
of
the
sail
.
i
better
put
a
small
line
out
with
a
spoon
on
it
and
try
and
get
something
to
eat
and
drink
for
the
moisture
.
but
he
could
not
find
a
spoon
and
his
sardines
were
rotten
.
so
he
hooked
a
patch
of
yellow
gulf
weed
with
the
gaff
as
they
passed
and
shook
it
so
that
the
small
shrimps
that
were
in
it
fell
onto
the
planking
of
the
skiff
.
there
were
more
than
a
dozen
of
them
and
they
jumped
and
kicked
like
sand
fleas
.
the
old
man
pinched
their
heads
off
with
his
thumb
and
forefinger
and
ate
them
chewing
up
the
shells
and
the
tails
.
they
were
very
tiny
but
he
knew
they
were
nourishing
and
they
tasted
good
.
the
old
man
still
had
two
drinks
of
water
in
the
bottle
and
he
used
half
of
one
after
he
had
eaten
the
shrimps
.
the
skiff
was
sailing
well
considering
the
handicaps
and
he
steered
with
the
tiller
under
his
arm
.
he
could
see
the
fish
and
he
had
only
to
look
at
his
hands
and
feel
his
back
against
the
stern
to
know
that
this
had
truly
happened
and
was
not
a
dream
.
at
one
time
when
he
was
feeling
so
badly
toward
the
end
he
had
thought
perhaps
it
was
a
dream
.
then
when
he
had
seen
the
fish
come
out
of
the
water
and
hang
motionless
in
the
sky
before
he
fell
he
was
sure
there
was
some
great
strangeness
and
he
could
not
believe
it
.
then
he
could
not
see
well
although
now
he
saw
as
well
as
ever
.
now
he
knew
there
was
the
fish
and
his
hands
and
back
were
no
dream
.
the
hands
cure
quickly
he
thought
.
i
bled
them
clean
and
the
salt
water
will
heal
them
.
the
dark
water
of
the
true
gulf
is
the
greatest
healer
that
there
is
.
all
i
must
do
is
keep
the
head
clear
.
the
hands
have
done
their
work
and
we
sail
well
.
with
his
mouth
shut
and
his
tail
straight
up
and
down
we
sail
like
brothers
.
then
his
head
started
to
become
a
little
unclear
and
he
thought
is
he
bringing
me
in
or
am
i
bringing
him
in
if
i
were
towing
him
behind
there
would
be
no
question
.
nor
if
the
fish
were
in
the
skiff
with
all
dignity
gone
there
would
be
no
question
either
.
but
they
were
sailing
together
lashed
side
by
side
and
the
old
man
thought
let
him
bring
me
in
if
it
pleases
him
.
i
am
only
better
than
him
through
trickery
and
he
meant
me
no
harm
.
they
sailed
well
and
the
old
man
soaked
his
hands
in
the
salt
water
and
tried
to
keep
his
head
clear
.
there
were
high
cumulus
clouds
and
enough
cirrus
above
them
so
that
the
old
man
knew
the
breeze
would
last
all
night
.
the
old
man
looked
at
the
fish
constantly
to
make
sure
it
was
true
.
it
was
an
hour
before
the
first
shark
hit
him
.
the
shark
was
not
an
accident
.
he
had
come
up
from
deep
down
in
the
water
as
the
dark
cloud
of
blood
had
settled
and
dispersed
in
the
mile
deep
sea
.
he
had
come
up
so
fast
and
absolutely
without
caution
that
he
broke
the
surface
of
the
blue
water
and
was
in
the
sun
.
then
he
fell
back
into
the
sea
and
picked
up
the
scent
and
started
swimming
on
the
course
the
skiff
and
the
fish
had
taken
.
sometimes
he
lost
the
scent
.
but
he
would
pick
it
up
again
or
have
just
a
trace
of
it
and
he
swam
fast
and
hard
on
the
course
.
he
was
a
very
big
make
shark
built
to
swim
as
fast
as
the
fastest
fish
in
the
sea
and
everything
about
him
was
beautiful
except
his
jaws
.
his
back
was
as
blue
as
a
sword
fishs
and
his
belly
was
silver
and
his
hide
was
smooth
and
handsome
.
he
was
built
as
a
sword
fish
except
for
his
huge
jaws
which
were
tight
shut
now
as
he
swam
fast
just
under
the
surface
with
his
high
dorsal
fin
knifing
through
the
water
without
wavering
.
inside
the
closed
double
lip
of
his
jaws
all
of
his
eight
rows
of
teeth
were
slanted
inwards
.
they
were
not
the
ordinary
pyramidshaped
teeth
of
most
sharks
.
they
were
shaped
like
a
mans
fingers
when
they
are
crisped
like
claws
.
they
were
nearly
as
long
as
the
fingers
of
the
old
man
and
they
had
razorsharp
cutting
edges
on
both
sides
.
this
was
a
fish
built
to
feed
on
all
the
fishes
in
the
sea
that
were
so
fast
and
strong
and
well
armed
that
they
had
no
other
enemy
.
now
he
speeded
up
as
he
smelled
the
fresher
scent
and
his
blue
dorsal
fin
cut
the
water
.
when
the
old
man
saw
him
coming
he
knew
that
this
was
a
shark
that
had
no
fear
at
all
and
would
do
exactly
what
he
wished
.
he
prepared
the
harpoon
and
made
the
rope
fast
while
he
watched
the
shark
come
on
.
the
rope
was
short
as
it
lacked
what
he
had
cut
away
to
lash
the
fish
.
the
old
mans
head
was
clear
and
good
now
and
he
was
full
of
resolution
but
he
had
little
hope
.
it
was
too
good
to
last
he
thought
.
he
took
one
look
at
the
great
fish
as
he
watched
the
shark
close
in
.
it
might
as
well
have
been
a
dream
he
thought
.
i
cannot
keep
him
from
hitting
me
but
maybe
i
can
get
him
.
dentuso
he
thought
.
bad
luck
to
your
mother
.
the
shark
closed
fast
astern
and
when
he
hit
the
fish
the
old
man
saw
his
mouth
open
and
his
strange
eyes
and
the
clicking
chop
of
the
teeth
as
he
drove
forward
in
the
meat
just
above
the
tail
.
the
sharks
head
was
out
of
water
and
his
back
was
coming
out
and
the
old
man
could
hear
the
noise
of
skin
and
flesh
ripping
on
the
big
fish
when
he
rammed
the
harpoon
down
onto
the
sharks
head
at
a
spot
where
the
line
between
his
eyes
intersected
with
the
line
that
ran
straight
back
from
his
nose
.
there
were
no
such
lines
.
there
was
only
the
heavy
sharp
blue
head
and
the
big
eyes
and
the
clicking
thrusting
allswallowing
jaws
.
but
that
was
the
location
of
the
brain
and
the
old
man
hit
it
.
he
hit
it
with
his
blood
mushed
hands
driving
a
good
harpoon
with
all
his
strength
.
he
hit
it
without
hope
but
with
resolution
and
complete
malignancy
.
the
shark
swung
over
and
the
old
man
saw
his
eye
was
not
alive
and
then
he
swung
over
once
again
wrapping
himself
in
two
loops
of
the
rope
.
the
old
man
knew
that
he
was
dead
but
the
shark
would
not
accept
it
.
then
on
his
back
with
his
tail
lashing
and
his
jaws
clicking
the
shark
plowed
over
the
water
as
a
speedboat
does
.
the
water
was
white
where
his
tail
beat
it
and
threequarters
of
his
body
was
clear
above
the
water
when
the
rope
came
taut
shivered
and
then
snapped
.
the
shark
lay
quietly
for
a
little
while
on
the
surface
and
the
old
man
watched
him
.
then
he
went
down
very
slowly
.
he
took
about
forty
pounds
the
old
man
said
aloud
.
he
took
my
harpoon
too
and
all
the
rope
he
thought
and
now
my
fish
bleeds
again
and
there
will
be
others
.
he
did
not
like
to
look
at
the
fish
anymore
since
he
had
been
mutilated
.
when
the
fish
had
been
hit
it
was
as
though
he
himself
were
hit
.
but
i
killed
the
shark
that
hit
my
fish
he
thought
.
and
he
was
the
biggest
dentuso
that
i
have
ever
seen
.
and
god
knows
that
i
have
seen
big
ones
.
it
was
too
good
to
last
he
thought
.
i
wish
it
had
been
a
dream
now
and
that
i
had
never
hooked
the
fish
and
was
alone
in
bed
on
the
newspapers
.
but
man
is
not
made
for
defeat
he
said
.
a
man
can
be
destroyed
but
not
defeated
.
i
am
sorry
that
i
killed
the
fish
though
he
thought
.
now
the
bad
time
is
coming
and
i
do
not
even
have
the
harpoon
.
the
dentuso
is
cruel
and
able
and
strong
and
intelligent
.
but
i
was
more
intelligent
than
he
was
.
perhaps
not
he
thought
.
perhaps
i
was
only
better
armed
.
dont
think
old
man
he
said
aloud
.
sail
on
this
course
and
take
it
when
it
comes
.
but
i
must
think
he
thought
.
because
it
is
all
i
have
left
.
that
and
baseball
.
i
wonder
how
the
great
dimaggio
would
have
liked
the
way
i
hit
him
in
the
brain
it
was
no
great
thing
he
thought
.
any
man
could
do
it
.
but
do
you
think
my
hands
were
as
great
a
handicap
as
the
bone
spurs
i
cannot
know
.
i
never
had
anything
wrong
with
my
heel
except
the
time
the
sting
ray
stung
it
when
i
stepped
on
him
when
swimming
and
paralyzed
the
lower
leg
and
made
the
unbearable
pain
.
think
about
something
cheerful
old
man
he
said
.
every
minute
now
you
are
closer
to
home
.
you
sail
lighter
for
the
loss
of
forty
pounds
.
he
knew
quite
well
the
pattern
of
what
could
happen
when
he
reached
the
inner
part
of
the
current
.
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
now
.
yes
there
is
he
said
aloud
.
i
can
lash
my
knife
to
the
butt
of
one
of
the
oars
.
so
he
did
that
with
the
tiller
under
his
arm
and
the
sheet
of
the
sail
under
his
foot
.
now
he
said
.
i
am
still
an
old
man
.
but
i
am
not
unarmed
.
the
breeze
was
fresh
now
and
he
sailed
on
well
.
he
watched
only
the
forward
part
of
the
fish
and
some
of
his
hope
returned
.
it
is
silly
not
to
hope
he
thought
.
besides
i
believe
it
is
a
sin
.
do
not
think
about
sin
he
thought
.
there
are
enough
problems
now
without
sin
.
also
i
have
no
understanding
of
it
.
i
have
no
understanding
of
it
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
believe
in
it
.
perhaps
it
was
a
sin
to
kill
the
fish
.
i
suppose
it
was
even
though
i
did
it
to
keep
me
alive
and
feed
many
people
.
but
then
everything
is
a
sin
.
do
not
think
about
sin
.
it
is
much
too
late
for
that
and
there
are
people
who
are
paid
to
do
it
.
let
them
think
about
it
.
you
were
born
to
be
a
fisherman
as
the
fish
was
born
to
be
a
fish
.
san
pedro
was
a
fisherman
as
was
the
father
of
the
great
dimaggio
.
but
he
liked
to
think
about
all
things
that
he
was
involved
in
and
since
there
was
nothing
to
read
and
he
did
not
have
a
radio
he
thought
much
and
he
kept
on
thinking
about
sin
.
you
did
not
kill
the
fish
only
to
keep
alive
and
to
sell
for
food
he
thought
.
you
killed
him
for
pride
and
because
you
are
a
fisherman
.
you
loved
him
when
he
was
alive
and
you
loved
him
after
.
if
you
love
him
it
is
not
a
sin
to
kill
him
.
or
is
it
more
you
think
too
much
old
man
he
said
aloud
.
but
you
enjoyed
killing
the
dentuso
he
thought
.
he
lives
on
the
live
fish
as
you
do
.
he
is
not
a
scavenger
nor
just
a
moving
appetite
as
some
sharks
are
.
he
is
beautiful
and
noble
and
knows
no
fear
of
anything
.
i
killed
him
in
selfdefense
the
old
man
said
aloud
.
and
i
killed
him
well
.
besides
he
thought
everything
kills
everything
else
in
some
way
.
fishing
kills
me
exactly
as
it
keeps
me
alive
.
the
boy
keeps
me
alive
he
thought
.
i
must
not
deceive
myself
too
much
.
he
leaned
over
the
side
and
pulled
loose
a
piece
of
the
meat
of
the
fish
where
the
shark
had
cut
him
.
he
chewed
it
and
noted
its
quality
and
its
good
taste
.
it
was
firm
and
juicy
like
meat
but
it
was
not
red
.
there
was
no
stringiness
in
it
and
he
knew
that
it
would
bring
the
highest
price
in
the
market
.
but
there
was
no
way
to
keep
its
scent
out
of
the
water
and
the
old
man
knew
that
a
very
had
time
was
coming
.
the
breeze
was
steady
.
it
had
backed
a
little
further
into
the
northeast
and
he
knew
that
meant
that
it
would
not
fall
off
.
the
old
man
looked
ahead
of
him
but
he
could
see
no
sails
nor
could
he
see
the
hull
nor
the
smoke
of
any
ship
.
there
were
only
the
flying
fish
that
went
up
from
his
bow
sailing
away
to
either
side
and
the
yellow
patches
of
gulf
weed
.
he
could
not
even
see
a
bird
.
he
had
sailed
for
two
hours
resting
in
the
stern
and
sometimes
chewing
a
bit
of
the
meat
from
the
marlin
trying
to
rest
and
to
be
strong
when
he
saw
the
first
of
the
two
sharks
.
ay
he
said
aloud
.
there
is
no
translation
for
this
word
and
perhaps
it
is
just
a
noise
such
as
a
man
might
make
involuntarily
feeling
the
nail
go
through
his
hands
and
into
the
wood
.
galanos
he
said
aloud
.
he
had
seen
the
second
fin
now
coming
up
behind
the
first
and
had
identified
them
as
shovelnosed
sharks
by
the
brown
triangular
fin
and
the
sweeping
movements
of
the
tail
.
they
had
the
scent
and
were
excited
and
in
the
stupidity
of
their
great
hunger
they
were
losing
and
finding
the
scent
in
their
excitement
.
but
they
were
closing
all
the
time
.
the
old
man
made
the
sheet
fast
and
jammed
the
tiller
.
then
he
took
up
the
oar
with
the
knife
lashed
to
it
.
he
lifted
it
as
lightly
as
he
could
because
his
hands
rebelled
at
the
pain
.
then
he
opened
and
closed
them
on
it
lightly
to
loosen
them
.
he
closed
them
firmly
so
they
would
take
the
pain
now
and
would
not
flinch
and
watched
the
sharks
come
.
he
could
see
their
wide
flattened
shovelpointed
heads
now
and
their
white
tipped
wide
pectoral
fins
.
they
were
hateful
sharks
bad
smelling
scavengers
as
well
as
killers
and
when
they
were
hungry
they
would
bite
at
an
oar
or
the
rudder
of
a
boat
.
it
was
these
sharks
that
would
cut
the
turtles
legs
and
flippers
off
when
the
turtles
were
asleep
on
the
surface
and
they
would
hit
a
man
in
the
water
if
they
were
hungry
even
if
the
man
had
no
smell
of
fish
blood
nor
of
fish
slime
on
him
.
ay
the
old
man
said
.
galanos
.
come
on
galanos
.
they
came
.
but
they
did
not
come
as
the
mako
had
come
.
one
turned
and
went
out
of
sight
under
the
skiff
and
the
old
man
could
feel
the
skiff
shake
as
he
jerked
and
pulled
on
the
fish
.
the
other
watched
the
old
man
with
his
slitted
yellow
eyes
and
then
came
in
fast
with
his
half
circle
of
jaws
wide
to
hit
the
fish
where
he
had
already
been
bitten
.
the
line
showed
clearly
on
the
top
of
his
brown
head
and
back
where
the
brain
joined
the
spinal
cord
and
the
old
man
drove
the
knife
on
the
oar
into
the
juncture
withdrew
it
and
drove
it
in
again
into
the
sharks
yellow
catlike
eyes
.
the
shark
let
go
of
the
fish
and
slid
down
swallowing
what
he
had
taken
as
he
died
.
the
skiff
was
still
shaking
with
the
destruction
the
other
shark
was
doing
to
the
fish
and
the
old
man
let
go
the
sheet
so
that
the
skiff
would
swing
broadside
and
bring
the
shark
out
from
under
.
when
he
saw
the
shark
he
leaned
over
the
side
and
punched
at
him
.
he
hit
only
meat
and
the
hide
was
set
hard
and
he
barely
got
the
knife
in
.
the
blow
hurt
not
only
his
hands
but
his
shoulder
too
.
but
the
shark
came
up
fast
with
his
head
out
and
the
old
man
hit
him
squarely
in
the
center
of
his
flattopped
head
as
his
nose
came
out
of
water
and
lay
against
the
fish
.
the
old
man
withdrew
the
blade
and
punched
the
shark
exactly
in
the
same
spot
again
.
he
still
hung
to
the
fish
with
his
jaws
hooked
and
the
old
man
stabbed
him
in
his
left
eye
.
the
shark
still
hung
there
.
no
the
old
man
said
and
he
drove
the
blade
between
the
vertebrae
and
the
brain
.
it
was
an
easy
shot
now
and
he
felt
the
cartilage
sever
.
the
old
man
reversed
the
oar
and
put
the
blade
between
the
sharks
jaws
to
open
them
.
he
twisted
the
blade
and
as
the
shark
slid
loose
he
said
go
on
galano
.
slide
down
a
mile
deep
.
go
see
your
friend
or
maybe
its
your
mother
.
the
old
man
wiped
the
blade
of
his
knife
and
laid
down
the
oar
.
then
he
found
the
sheet
and
the
sail
filled
and
he
brought
the
skiff
onto
her
course
.
they
must
have
taken
a
quarter
of
him
and
of
the
best
meat
he
said
aloud
.
i
wish
it
were
a
dream
and
that
i
had
never
hooked
him
.
im
sorry
about
it
fish
.
it
makes
everything
wrong
.
he
stopped
and
he
did
not
want
to
look
at
the
fish
now
.
drained
of
blood
and
awash
he
looked
the
colour
of
the
silver
backing
of
a
minor
and
his
stripes
still
showed
.
i
shouldnt
have
gone
out
so
far
fish
he
said
.
neither
for
you
nor
for
me
.
im
sorry
fish
.
now
he
said
to
himself
.
look
to
the
lashing
on
the
knife
and
see
if
it
has
been
cut
.
then
get
your
hand
in
order
because
there
still
is
more
to
come
.
i
wish
i
had
a
stone
for
the
knife
the
old
man
said
after
he
had
checked
the
lashing
on
the
oar
butt
.
i
should
have
brought
a
stone
.
you
should
have
brought
many
things
he
thought
.
but
you
did
not
bring
them
old
man
.
now
is
no
time
to
think
of
what
you
do
not
have
.
think
of
what
you
can
do
with
what
there
is
.
you
give
me
much
good
counsel
he
said
aloud
.
im
tired
of
it
.
he
held
the
tiller
under
his
arm
and
soaked
both
his
hands
in
the
water
as
the
skiff
drove
forward
.
god
knows
how
much
that
last
one
took
he
said
.
but
shes
much
lighter
now
.
he
did
not
want
to
think
of
the
mutilated
underside
of
the
fish
.
he
knew
that
each
of
the
jerking
bumps
of
the
shark
had
been
meat
torn
away
and
that
the
fish
now
made
a
trail
for
all
sharks
as
wide
as
a
highway
through
the
sea
.
he
was
a
fish
to
keep
a
man
all
winter
he
thought
dont
think
of
that
.
just
rest
and
try
to
get
your
hands
in
shape
to
defend
what
is
left
of
him
.
the
blood
smell
from
my
hands
means
nothing
now
with
all
that
scent
in
the
water
.
besides
they
do
not
bleed
much
.
there
is
nothing
cut
that
means
anything
.
the
bleeding
may
keep
the
left
from
cramping
.
what
can
i
think
of
now
he
thought
.
nothing
.
i
must
think
of
nothing
and
wait
for
the
next
ones
.
i
wish
it
had
really
been
a
dream
he
thought
.
but
who
knows
it
might
have
turned
out
well
.
the
next
shark
that
came
was
a
single
shovelnose
.
he
came
like
a
pig
to
the
trough
if
a
pig
had
a
mouth
so
wide
that
you
could
put
your
head
in
it
.
the
old
man
let
him
hit
the
fish
and
then
drove
the
knife
on
the
oar
don
into
his
brain
.
but
the
shark
jerked
backwards
as
he
rolled
and
the
knife
blade
snapped
.
the
old
man
settled
himself
to
steer
.
he
did
not
even
watch
the
big
shark
sinking
slowly
in
the
water
showing
first
lifesize
then
small
then
tiny
.
that
always
fascinated
the
old
man
.
but
he
did
not
even
watch
it
now
.
i
have
the
gaff
now
he
said
.
but
it
will
do
no
good
.
i
have
the
two
oars
and
the
tiller
and
the
short
club
.
now
they
have
beaten
me
he
thought
.
i
am
too
old
to
club
sharks
to
death
.
but
i
will
try
it
as
long
as
i
have
the
oars
and
the
short
club
and
the
tiller
.
he
put
his
hands
in
the
water
again
to
soak
them
.
it
was
getting
late
in
the
afternoon
and
he
saw
nothing
but
the
sea
and
the
sky
.
there
was
more
wind
in
the
sky
than
there
had
been
and
soon
he
hoped
that
he
would
see
land
.
youre
tired
old
man
he
said
.
youre
tired
inside
.
the
sharks
did
not
hit
him
again
until
just
before
sunset
.
the
old
man
saw
the
brown
fins
coming
along
the
wide
trail
the
fish
must
make
in
the
water
.
they
were
not
even
quartering
on
the
scent
.
they
were
headed
straight
for
the
skiff
swimming
side
by
side
.
he
jammed
the
tiller
made
the
sheet
fast
and
reached
under
the
stem
for
the
club
.
it
was
an
oar
handle
from
a
broken
oar
sawed
off
to
about
two
and
a
half
feet
in
length
.
he
could
only
use
it
effectively
with
one
hand
because
of
the
grip
of
the
handle
and
he
took
good
hold
of
it
with
his
right
hand
flexing
his
hand
on
it
as
he
watched
the
sharks
come
.
they
were
both
galanos
.
i
must
let
the
first
one
get
a
good
hold
and
hit
him
on
the
point
of
the
nose
or
straight
across
the
top
of
the
head
he
thought
.
the
two
sharks
closed
together
and
as
he
saw
the
one
nearest
him
open
his
jaws
and
sink
them
into
the
silver
side
of
the
fish
he
raised
the
club
high
and
brought
it
down
heavy
and
slamming
onto
the
top
of
the
sharks
broad
head
.
he
felt
the
rubbery
solidity
as
the
club
came
down
.
but
he
felt
the
rigidity
of
bone
too
and
he
struck
the
shark
once
more
hard
across
the
point
of
the
nose
as
he
slid
down
from
the
fish
.
the
other
shark
had
been
in
and
out
and
now
came
in
again
with
his
jaws
wide
.
the
old
man
could
see
pieces
of
the
meat
of
the
fish
spilling
white
from
the
corner
of
his
jaws
as
he
bumped
the
fish
and
closed
his
jaws
.
he
swung
at
him
and
hit
only
the
head
and
the
shark
looked
at
him
and
wrenched
the
meat
loose
.
the
old
man
swung
the
club
down
on
him
again
as
he
slipped
away
to
swallow
and
hit
only
the
heavy
solid
rubberiness
.
come
on
galano
the
old
man
said
.
come
in
again
.
the
shark
came
in
a
rush
and
the
old
man
hit
him
as
he
shut
his
jaws
.
he
hit
him
solidly
and
from
as
high
up
as
he
could
raise
the
club
.
this
time
he
felt
the
bone
at
the
base
of
the
brain
and
he
hit
him
again
in
the
same
place
while
the
shark
tore
the
meat
loose
sluggishly
and
slid
down
from
the
fish
.
the
old
man
watched
for
him
to
come
again
but
neither
shark
showed
.
then
he
saw
one
on
the
surface
swimming
in
circles
.
he
did
not
see
the
fin
of
the
other
.
i
could
not
expect
to
kill
them
he
thought
.
i
could
have
in
my
time
.
but
i
have
hurt
them
both
badly
and
neither
one
can
feel
very
good
.
if
i
could
have
used
a
bat
with
two
hands
i
could
have
killed
the
first
one
surely
.
even
now
he
thought
.
he
did
not
want
to
look
at
the
fish
.
he
knew
that
half
of
him
had
been
destroyed
.
the
sun
had
gone
down
while
he
had
been
in
the
fight
with
the
sharks
.
it
will
be
dark
soon
he
said
.
then
i
should
see
the
glow
of
havana
if
i
am
too
far
to
the
eastward
i
will
see
the
lights
of
one
of
the
new
beaches
.
i
cannot
be
too
far
out
now
he
thought
.
i
hope
no
one
has
been
too
worried
.
there
is
only
the
boy
to
worry
of
course
.
but
i
am
sure
he
would
have
confidence
.
many
of
the
older
fishermen
will
worry
.
many
others
too
he
thought
.
i
live
in
a
good
town
.
he
could
not
talk
to
the
fish
anymore
because
the
fish
had
been
ruined
too
badly
.
then
something
came
into
his
head
.
half
fish
he
said
.
fish
that
you
were
.
i
am
sorry
that
i
went
too
far
out
.
i
ruined
us
both
.
but
we
have
killed
many
sharks
you
and
i
and
ruined
many
others
.
how
many
did
you
ever
kill
old
fish
you
do
not
have
that
spear
on
your
head
for
nothing
.
he
liked
to
think
of
the
fish
and
what
he
could
do
to
a
shark
if
he
were
swimming
free
.
i
should
have
chopped
the
bill
off
to
fight
them
with
he
thought
.
but
there
was
no
hatchet
and
then
there
was
no
knife
.
but
if
i
had
and
could
have
lashed
it
to
an
oar
butt
what
a
weapon
.
then
we
might
have
fought
them
together
.
what
will
you
do
now
if
they
come
in
the
night
what
can
you
do
fight
them
he
said
.
ill
fight
them
until
i
die
.
but
in
the
dark
now
and
no
glow
showing
and
no
lights
and
only
the
wind
and
the
steady
pull
of
the
sail
he
felt
that
perhaps
he
was
already
dead
.
he
put
his
two
hands
together
and
felt
the
palms
.
they
were
not
dead
and
he
could
bring
the
pain
of
life
by
simply
opening
and
closing
them
.
he
leaned
his
back
against
the
stern
and
knew
he
was
not
dead
.
his
shoulders
told
him
.
i
have
all
those
prayers
i
promised
if
i
caught
the
fish
he
thought
.
but
i
am
too
tired
to
say
them
now
.
i
better
get
the
sack
and
put
it
over
my
shoulders
.
he
lay
in
the
stern
and
steered
and
watched
for
the
glow
to
come
in
the
sky
.
i
have
half
of
him
he
thought
.
maybe
ill
have
the
luck
to
bring
the
forward
half
in
.
i
should
have
some
luck
.
no
he
said
.
you
violated
your
luck
when
you
went
too
far
outside
.
dont
be
silly
he
said
aloud
.
and
keep
awake
and
steer
.
you
may
have
much
luck
yet
.
id
like
to
buy
some
if
theres
any
place
they
sell
it
he
said
.
what
could
i
buy
it
with
he
asked
himself
.
could
i
buy
it
with
a
lost
harpoon
and
a
broken
knife
and
two
bad
hands
you
might
he
said
.
you
tried
to
buy
it
with
eightyfour
days
at
sea
.
they
nearly
sold
it
to
you
too
.
i
must
not
think
nonsense
he
thought
.
luck
is
a
thing
that
comes
in
many
forms
and
who
can
recognize
her
i
would
take
some
though
in
any
form
and
pay
what
they
asked
.
i
wish
i
could
see
the
glow
from
the
lights
he
thought
.
i
wish
too
many
things
.
but
that
is
the
thing
i
wish
for
now
.
he
tried
to
settle
more
comfortably
to
steer
and
from
his
pain
he
knew
he
was
not
dead
.
he
saw
the
reflected
glare
of
the
lights
of
the
city
at
what
must
have
been
around
ten
oclock
at
night
.
they
were
only
perceptible
at
first
as
the
light
is
in
the
sky
before
the
moon
rises
.
then
they
were
steady
to
see
across
the
ocean
which
was
rough
now
with
the
increasing
breeze
.
he
steered
inside
of
the
glow
and
he
thought
that
now
soon
he
must
hit
the
edge
of
the
stream
.
now
it
is
over
he
thought
.
they
will
probably
hit
me
again
.
but
what
can
a
man
do
against
them
in
the
dark
without
a
weapon
he
was
stiff
and
sore
now
and
his
wounds
and
all
of
the
strained
parts
of
his
body
hurt
with
the
cold
of
the
night
.
i
hope
i
do
not
have
to
fight
again
he
thought
.
i
hope
so
much
i
do
not
have
to
fight
again
.
but
by
midnight
he
fought
and
this
time
he
knew
the
fight
was
useless
.
they
came
in
a
pack
and
he
could
only
see
the
lines
in
the
water
that
their
fins
made
and
their
phosphorescence
as
they
threw
themselves
on
the
fish
.
he
clubbed
at
heads
and
heard
the
jaws
chop
and
the
shaking
of
the
skiff
as
they
took
hold
below
.
he
clubbed
desperately
at
what
he
could
only
feel
and
hear
and
he
felt
something
seize
the
club
and
it
was
gone
.
he
jerked
the
tiller
free
from
the
rudder
and
beat
and
chopped
with
it
holding
it
in
both
hands
and
driving
it
down
again
and
again
.
but
they
were
up
to
the
bow
now
and
driving
in
one
after
the
other
and
together
tearing
off
the
pieces
of
meat
that
showed
glowing
below
the
sea
as
they
turned
to
come
once
more
.
one
came
finally
against
the
head
itself
and
he
knew
that
it
was
over
.
he
swung
the
tiller
across
the
sharks
head
where
the
jaws
were
caught
in
the
heaviness
of
the
fishs
head
which
would
not
tear
.
he
swung
it
once
and
twice
and
again
.
he
heard
the
tiller
break
and
he
lunged
at
the
shark
with
the
splintered
butt
.
he
felt
it
go
in
and
knowing
it
was
sharp
he
drove
it
in
again
.
the
shark
let
go
and
rolled
away
.
that
was
the
last
shark
of
the
pack
that
came
.
there
was
nothing
more
for
them
to
eat
.
the
old
man
could
hardly
breathe
now
and
he
felt
a
strange
taste
in
his
mouth
.
it
was
coppery
and
sweet
and
he
was
afraid
of
it
for
a
moment
.
but
there
was
not
much
of
it
.
he
spat
into
the
ocean
and
said
eat
that
galanos
.
and
make
a
dream
youve
killed
a
man
.
he
knew
he
was
beaten
now
finally
and
without
remedy
and
he
went
back
to
the
stern
and
found
the
jagged
end
of
the
tiller
would
fit
in
the
slot
of
the
rudder
well
enough
for
him
to
steer
.
he
settled
the
sack
around
his
shoulders
and
put
the
skiff
on
her
course
.
he
sailed
lightly
now
and
he
had
no
thoughts
nor
any
feelings
of
any
kind
.
he
was
past
everything
now
and
he
sailed
the
skiff
to
make
his
home
port
as
well
and
as
intelligently
as
he
could
.
in
the
night
sharks
hit
the
carcass
as
someone
might
pick
up
crumbs
from
the
table
.
the
old
man
paid
no
attention
to
them
and
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
anything
except
steering
.
he
only
noticed
how
lightly
and
bow
well
the
skiff
sailed
now
there
was
no
great
weight
beside
her
.
shes
good
he
thought
.
she
is
sound
and
not
harmed
in
any
way
except
for
the
tiller
.
that
is
easily
replaced
.
he
could
feel
he
was
inside
the
current
now
and
he
could
see
the
lights
of
the
beach
colonies
along
the
shore
.
he
knew
where
he
was
now
and
it
was
nothing
to
get
home
.
the
wind
is
our
friend
anyway
he
thought
.
then
he
added
sometimes
.
and
the
great
sea
with
our
friends
and
our
enemies
.
and
bed
he
thought
.
bed
is
my
friend
.
just
bed
he
thought
.
bed
will
be
a
great
thing
.
it
is
easy
when
you
are
beaten
he
thought
.
i
never
knew
how
easy
it
was
.
and
what
beat
you
he
thought
.
nothing
he
said
aloud
.
i
went
out
too
far
.
when
he
sailed
into
the
little
harbour
the
lights
of
the
terrace
were
out
and
he
knew
everyone
was
in
bed
.
the
breeze
had
risen
steadily
and
was
blowing
strongly
now
.
it
was
quiet
in
the
harbour
though
and
he
sailed
up
onto
the
little
patch
of
shingle
below
the
rocks
.
there
was
no
one
to
help
him
so
he
pulled
the
boat
up
as
far
as
he
could
.
then
he
stepped
out
and
made
her
fast
to
a
rock
.
he
unstepped
the
mast
and
furled
the
sail
and
tied
it
.
then
he
shouldered
the
mast
and
started
to
climb
.
it
was
then
he
knew
the
depth
of
his
tiredness
.
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
looked
back
and
saw
in
the
reflection
from
the
street
light
the
great
tail
of
the
fish
standing
up
well
behind
the
skiffs
stern
.
he
saw
the
white
naked
line
of
his
backbone
and
the
dark
mass
of
the
head
with
the
projecting
bill
and
all
the
nakedness
between
.
he
started
to
climb
again
and
at
the
top
he
fell
and
lay
for
some
time
with
the
mast
across
his
shoulder
.
he
tried
to
get
up
.
but
it
was
too
difficult
and
he
sat
there
with
the
mast
on
his
shoulder
and
looked
at
the
road
.
a
cat
passed
on
the
far
side
going
about
its
business
and
the
old
man
watched
it
.
then
he
just
watched
the
road
.
finally
he
put
the
mast
down
and
stood
up
.
he
picked
the
mast
up
and
put
it
on
his
shoulder
and
started
up
the
road
.
he
had
to
sit
down
five
times
before
he
reached
his
shack
.
inside
the
shack
he
leaned
the
mast
against
the
wall
.
in
the
dark
he
found
a
water
bottle
and
took
a
drink
.
then
he
lay
down
on
the
bed
.
he
pulled
the
blanket
over
his
shoulders
and
then
over
his
back
and
legs
and
he
slept
face
down
on
the
newspapers
with
his
arms
out
straight
and
the
palms
of
his
hands
up
.
he
was
asleep
when
the
boy
looked
in
the
door
in
the
morning
.
it
was
blowing
so
hard
that
the
driftingboats
would
not
be
going
out
and
the
boy
had
slept
late
and
then
come
to
the
old
mans
shack
as
he
had
come
each
morning
.
the
boy
saw
that
the
old
man
was
breathing
and
then
he
saw
the
old
mans
hands
and
he
started
to
cry
.
he
went
out
very
quietly
to
go
to
bring
some
coffee
and
all
the
way
down
the
road
he
was
crying
.
many
fishermen
were
around
the
skiff
looking
at
what
was
lashed
beside
it
and
one
was
in
the
water
his
trousers
rolled
up
measuring
the
skeleton
with
a
length
of
line
.
the
boy
did
not
go
down
.
he
had
been
there
before
and
one
of
the
fishermen
was
looking
after
the
skiff
for
him
.
how
is
he
one
of
the
fishermen
shouted
.
sleeping
the
boy
called
.
he
did
not
care
that
they
saw
him
crying
.
let
no
one
disturb
him
.
he
was
eighteen
feet
from
nose
to
tail
the
fisherman
who
was
measuring
him
called
.
i
believe
it
the
boy
said
.
he
went
into
the
terrace
and
asked
for
a
can
of
coffee
.
hot
and
with
plenty
of
milk
and
sugar
in
it
.
anything
more
no
.
afterwards
i
will
see
what
he
can
eat
.
what
a
fish
it
was
the
proprietor
said
.
there
has
never
been
such
a
fish
.
those
were
two
fine
fish
you
took
yesterday
too
.
damn
my
fish
the
boy
said
and
he
started
to
cry
again
.
do
you
want
a
drink
of
any
kind
the
proprietor
asked
.
no
the
boy
said
.
tell
them
not
to
bother
santiago
.
ill
be
back
.
tell
him
how
sorry
i
am
.
thanks
the
boy
said
.
the
boy
carried
the
hot
can
of
coffee
up
to
the
old
mans
shack
and
sat
by
him
until
he
woke
.
once
it
looked
as
though
he
were
waking
.
but
he
had
gone
back
into
heavy
sleep
and
the
boy
had
gone
across
the
road
to
borrow
some
wood
to
heat
the
coffee
.
finally
the
old
man
woke
.
dont
sit
up
the
boy
said
.
drink
this
.
he
poured
some
of
the
coffee
in
a
glass
.
the
old
man
took
it
and
drank
it
.
they
beat
me
manolin
he
said
.
they
truly
beat
me
.
he
didnt
beat
you
.
not
the
fish
.
no
.
truly
.
it
was
afterwards
.
pedrico
is
looking
after
the
skiff
and
the
gear
.
what
do
you
want
done
with
the
head
let
pedrico
chop
it
up
to
use
in
fish
traps
.
and
the
spear
you
keep
it
if
you
want
it
.
i
want
it
the
boy
said
.
now
we
must
make
our
plans
about
the
other
things
.
did
they
search
for
me
of
course
.
with
coast
guard
and
with
planes
.
the
ocean
is
very
big
and
a
skiff
is
small
and
hard
to
see
the
old
man
said
.
he
noticed
how
pleasant
it
was
to
have
someone
to
talk
to
instead
of
speaking
only
to
himself
and
to
the
sea
.
i
missed
you
he
said
.
what
did
you
catch
one
the
first
day
.
one
the
second
and
two
the
third
.
very
good
.
now
we
fish
together
again
.
no
.
i
am
not
lucky
.
i
am
not
lucky
anymore
.
the
hell
with
luck
the
boy
said
.
ill
bring
the
luck
with
me
.
what
will
your
family
say
i
do
not
care
.
i
caught
two
yesterday
.
but
we
will
fish
together
now
for
i
still
have
much
to
learn
.
we
must
get
a
good
killing
lance
and
always
have
it
on
board
.
you
can
make
the
blade
from
a
spring
leaf
from
an
old
ford
.
we
can
grind
it
in
guanabacoa
.
it
should
be
sharp
and
not
tempered
so
it
will
break
.
my
knife
broke
.
ill
get
another
knife
and
have
the
spring
ground
.
how
many
days
of
heavy
brisa
have
we
maybe
three
.
maybe
more
.
i
will
have
everything
in
order
the
boy
said
.
you
get
your
hands
well
old
man
.
i
know
how
to
care
for
them
.
in
the
night
i
spat
something
strange
and
felt
something
in
my
chest
was
broken
.
get
that
well
too
the
boy
said
.
lie
down
old
man
and
i
will
bring
you
your
clean
shirt
.
and
something
to
eat
.
bring
any
of
the
papers
of
the
time
that
i
was
gone
the
old
man
said
.
you
must
get
well
fast
for
there
is
much
that
i
can
learn
and
you
can
teach
me
everything
.
how
much
did
you
suffer
plenty
the
old
man
said
.
ill
bring
the
food
and
the
papers
the
boy
said
.
rest
well
old
man
.
i
will
bring
stuff
from
the
drugstore
for
your
hands
.
dont
forget
to
tell
pedrico
the
head
is
his
.
no
.
i
will
remember
.
as
the
boy
went
out
the
door
and
down
the
worn
coral
rock
road
he
was
crying
again
.
that
afternoon
there
was
a
party
of
tourists
at
the
terrace
and
looking
down
in
the
water
among
the
empty
beer
cans
and
dead
barracudas
a
woman
saw
a
great
long
white
spine
with
a
huge
tail
at
the
end
that
lifted
and
swung
with
the
tide
while
the
east
wind
blew
a
heavy
steady
sea
outside
the
entrance
to
the
harbour
.
whats
that
she
asked
a
waiter
and
pointed
to
the
long
backbone
